//MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 IMPRESSIONS:
 
I wanted to take a moment to give some impressions of this headphone and share them with the head-fi community. For comparison during this review, I will be using the headphones that I currently own-the //MARK\\Beyer //MARK\\dt990///MARK\\600 and the venerable //MARK\\Denon //MARK\\d2k.

BUILT QUALITY/CONSTRUCTION:
 
The packaging is sufficient and on par with most of the mid-fi products that I’ve purchased. Nothing special really to be noted here. It doesn’t come with the fancy wooden box but honestly, that’s not anything that I’d really be interested in. If the box cost the manufacturer $30 and they have to pass that cost through to the purchase price then I’d happily go without the box. There is a velvet type bag included.
 
The word “tank” comes to mind when I look at the build quality of the cans. They are made of almost entirely of metal with a thin leather pad around the headband-more on that later. This makes them fairly heavy. Not as heavy as their big brother, the //MARK\\he500 but close. The leather pads for the cups are nice and soft and remind me somewhat of the //MARK\\d2k //MARK\\pleather. There is a dual in cord with threaded junction for each cup. I would have much preferred that they had used an rca type connection here. The threads are small and can be cross threaded easily. Or it could be that my big fingers are just clumsy but I did have some trouble threading each side. Once you’ve made the connection then it’s done and you don’t stand the chance of them coming out so that would be the tradeoff. After the cable splits the thickness going down to the point that that it terminates is about the same as the //MARK\\d2k. There is no click adjustment for varying the position of the cups. It simply slides up and down with a fair amount of force and seems to stay in place after adjustment with no issues. I do not know if the slider might become loose after prolonged use. There is a good amount of clamp with these cans, but it can be adjusted by gently bending the headband.
 
PRICING
 
I feel that the price is reasonably fair. I’m excited that hifiman is able to make this tech more affordable and therefore available to a broader market. The planar tech is impressive and no doubt will continue to be more popular as the price becomes more reachable for those of us who typically purchase mid-fi products. I got mine from moon audio with a coupon for $360 plus shipping. At $300 or even $325 I think these would be great bang for this kind of tech and incredibly popular.
 
Amping and DAC
 
I have been using an //MARK\\Audio //MARK\\GD //MARK\\Compass for the past month, replacing my trusty //MARK\\fiio //MARK\\e10 for something a little more substantial. The //MARK\\he400 does not need a lot of amp to reach its potential but it does need quality. I’ve been very pleased with the //MARK\\Compass. For the Beyers and Denon’s the //MARK\\Compass is a great fit.  It rolls off the treble just a bit and tightens up the bass without any loss of impact. But…it did not work well with the //MARK\\he400. The mids seems hollow and lacks the crystal sparkle that you’d expect from planar. However, I found that the diminutive //MARK\\fiio //MARK\\e10 works quite well with the //MARK\\he400. The sound signature across the board became what I was expecting and seems to satisfy the //MARK\\he400 well.
 
SOUND
 
This is really where the rubber meets the road isn’t it? Both the treble and mids on the //MARK\\he400 are beautiful. The transparency and clarity are on a different level than with my dynamic driver headphones. The soundstage is tremendous with instrument separation that makes you feel like you are at a live performance. The bass is solid and tight with good extension and accuracy which is somewhat surprising for a planar hp. These are not bass cans for me although I’m a self-professed basshead. But I have to admit that it was very satisfying to listen to music with a good bass line with these. The denon goes lower and with a heavier impact, while the //MARK\\he400 is more accurate. I don’t want to undersell the bass with the hifiman’s. It is certainly satisfying albeit a touch off from the denon. I use the Beyers more for acoustic and live performances. Sometimes jazz and classical. Dave Matthews Band get a lot of play with them. The Denon gets more headtime with pop, rock and bass heavy music. The //MARK\\he400 exceeds the Beyer for me with the material that I would normally use the Beyer for. The sound is simply better. Instruments are cleaner and more accurate. Vocals and natural and often like velvet. The soundstage is bigger and the bass more satisfying. Compared to the //MARK\\d2k the //MARK\\he400’s are neck and neck with the material that I typically use the Denon for.
 
WHAT I LIKED:
 
*The overall sound-beautiful and transparent with stellar soundstage and imaging
*Ample bass with plenty of “meat” to eat to it-satisfying for a basshead-almost J
*Class A mids with wonderfully lifelike vocals
*Beats my //MARK\\Beyer //MARK\\990’s at everything but comfort and is “right there” with the //MARK\\d2k given the same material
 
WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:
 
*Somewhat too heavy for me. The //MARK\\d2k is about as heavy a headphone as I’m comfortable with.  The //MARK\\he400 weighs in at about 100grams more than the Denon. I would speculate that most people would not have a problem with the weight as I do though. 
*The headband is ridiculously under padded for a headphone at this price point. The foam layer underneath the leather is easily compressed within a few minutes and I can feel the metal band resting across the top of my head. If I decide to keep these, I would certainly replace it. I’d venture to guess that a $15 Beyer headband would make a night and day difference assuming that it would fit.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
The //MARK\\hifiman //MARK\\he400 is a fantastic headphone. The build quality is solid.  They are fun, very musical and the planar tech is just down right dripping with energy. At $360 plus shipping from moon audio, I feel that they are fairly priced and would make an impressive addition to anyone’s collection who does not own a set of planar cans. Honestly, my only real issue is with the comfort level. Personally I find them a bit too heavy and with an underpaded headband. Please understand that I am more sensitive to weight and clamp than most people. For a point of reference I find that //MARK\\AT //MARK\\m50 to have too much clamp if that helps to put the clamp issue into perspective. I can wear the //MARK\\he400 for about 40-45 minutes before the level of comfort prompts me to take them off. When I play music, I listen typically between one to three hours if I have an uninterrupted period. I do not want to be distracted by a headphone’s lack of comfort. I feel that there are too many companies that have proven great sound quality and comfort can be had in package. I can wear the Beyer’s for 4 hours plus without issue. The Denon’s I can wear about 3 hours plus without issue.
These are very very good headphones. I’m very eager to order a replacement headband and see if it is able alleviate much of the comfort issue that I have with these cans. 
 
OVERALL RATING
 
9.0 out of 10
 
This is my first review, so please be kind and feel free to leave comments or suggestions.
 
Edit January 1st, 2013.
 
In an effort to help those considering the //MARK\\he400 or just getting started with it, I'll add some of the discoveries made through this thread and add them here. I hope that those reading this thread will find it helpful. 
 
Mods:
 
*The most immediate way to improve on the sound quality of the //MARK\\he400 is simply to change the stock pads from pleather to velour. While the velours are not perfect, this is easiest way to get your he400 to sound better. The mids will sound smoother and more open and all the bass quantity and quality are preserved. All for $10!!
 
*Some find the //MARK\\he400 to be somewhat heavy. I personally find it comfortable but any heavier and it would give me issues. Most who find problems with the comfort have issues with clamp and weight across the top of the head via the headband. If clamp is your problem, this is a simple fix. The headband is made of metal and can be reshaped to clamp with less force. Gently grab the headphones by the cups with your thumb and index finger just at the base where the band meets the cups. Bend the band nearly flat and hold it there for several seconds. Try it out and see if you like the new clamp force. If it's still tight then simply repeat the procedure until you've arrived at your desired level of clamp. 
 
*wje/Wayne has offered a diy headband mod if you desire to make the headband more comfortable. See here: page 260
 
There is also a Beyer replacement pad that can easily be fitted to the //MARK\\he400 and can be purchased on amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Leatherette-Universal-Sennheiser-Beyerdynamic/dp/B00862522A
 
*Grill mod.Thanks to Jerg for this one. If you want to go beyond the velour SQ improvement and want to take on a very simple DIY mod, the original grills can be replaced and offer a noticeable SQ advantage. See here: http://www.head-fi.org/t/619447/hifiman-he400-he500-re-grilling-mod-56k-dial-up-users-beware
 
*Jergpad mod. http://www.head-fi.org/t/646812/hifiman-he500-he400-jergpad-mod-revised-jan-22-2013
 
*Cables. In as much as I'm able to tell, custom cables do not offer and significant SQ improvement with this headphone. But there are other advantages. The stock cable is stiff and terminated to 1/8. I prefer a softer more flexible cable, custom length and 1/4 termination. There are several companies offering very nice custom cables for the //MARK\\he400, such as Q Audio, Norse and Toxic Cables. They are all happy to give you a quote to finish off the //MARK\\he400 with a slick cable if you're willing to pony up the cash. 
 
Amping: 
 
One of the impressive qualities of the //MARK\\he400 is that it doesn't need a world class amp to shine and show it's abilities. In fact, it can be powered directly from an iphone/ipod. You'll struggle with volume and dynamics though. To get the //MARK\\he400 up to speed with an amp, you wont have to spend much though. I've tried the //MARK\\he400 on better than a half dozen amps and it performed well with all of them. One of the frequently asked questions is regarding which amp to buy for this headphone. On a budget for my money it's hard to beat the //MARK\\fiio //MARK\\e17. For about $139 shipped you get quite a package...hardware EQ, three levels of gain, a nice display and a portable all in one solution to boot. Pretty slick.  If you want to get the most from the //MARK\\he400, there are lot's of good offerings out there. The best that I've heard personally is the //MARK\\lyr and //MARK\\bifrost. Although this seems like overkill for an easy to drive ortho dynamic hp, there is some legroom with the //MARK\\he400 and you'll get it with this amp/dac combo. 
 
Also recently released is the small Schitt Stack which is getting good reviews. For those on a budget it's worthy of your consideration. TMRaven has a review up for this stack. 
 
Revisions, Revisions, Revisions 
 
This fine hp has not been without production problems. The first revision seemed more like a prototype. The second known as r2 (white drivers) was rock solid for the most part. Then in an effort to increase durability, we got r3 (light sandy brown colored drivers). R3 was very bright and fatiguing and was eventually recalled. I do give HFM credit for handling the recall as professionally as they could. All of the r3 has been pulled from the retailers and no stock should be available for purchase on a new pair. If you are considering picking up a used pair, be sure to ask for a picture of the driver without the pad on the be sure what you're getting. The color of the driver is the easiest way to determine the revision. 
 
FAQ SECTION
 
What mods are available for my //MARK\\he400?
 
Comfort-headband
Sound-pads, grill
*See above for details on the mods
*Jergpad mod-http://www.head-fi.org/t/646812/hifiman-he500-he400-jergpad-mod-revised-jan-22-2013
 
Where can I buy my pair?
 
Of course they are available at Amazon, but I always like to support small/local business. We have a great resource in Justin at headamp.com as a regular here on this thread. A gracious guy who is pleasure to work with.
 
Is it okay to buy a used pair?
 
 “Caveat Emptor” comes to mind here.  I have bought a couple of used he400’s here with no problem though. 
 
What amp/dac should I buy to make my he400 sound best?
 
The beauty of the headphone is that you don’t need to spend twice the cost of the headphone to get it to reach it’s full potential. This headphone can be powered from an ipod. You won’t get the full effect for volume and dynamics though. A good starting place is the //MARK\\e17 by fiio. The best amp that I’ve personally heard with the he400 is the //MARK\\lyr with a good set of tubes. Wow!! 
 
I’m having trouble with my //MARK\\he400, what to do?
 
*clamp-bend/reshape it (see above for procedure)
*pads-try velour, pleather, j$ pads
*channel cut out-tighten the cables. This is often the issue as it’s difficult to get these tight with your fingers. You can use a small pair of precision pliers being careful not to over tighten or scratch the paint. If this does not resolve the issue you may have a warranty issue. 
 
Why are the //MARK\\he400’s described as dark and bright at the same time?
 
The overall sound signature is what I’d call dark/neutral, with the exception of a slight bump in the treble around 8-11 hz range. Some report eliminating this with a pad swap (see Jerg pads) or by simply modifying the EQ slightly.
 
The //MARK\\he400 is easy to amp, can I use it as a portable or outdoors?
 
This is really a headphone for home use. It’s on the large size and is somewhat heavy and fully open.
 
I’m a basshead, are these headphones for me?
 
That depends. The beautiful textured bass is one of the hallmarks of this headphone. Most will find the bass some of the best that they’ve heard shy of the //MARK\\lcd2/3. It is not as colored as the //MARK\\denon //MARK\\dx000 line though.
 
I listen to x,y,z genre of music, are these good for that type of music?
 
The he400 is a good all rounder and works well with most genres of music.
 
Why did hifiman paint them that ugly blue color?
 
Please note that the paint responds excitedly to flash photography and is considerably darker in person than in most photos. There is always an option for custom paint if you prefer.
 
How do I get the damn pads off?
 
Just grab and edge of the pad and pull. Getting them back on or new ones on is not that tough though. The first two tabs, opposite of each other say at 12:00 and 6:00, will pop right in. The third tab will also go in easily if you hold the first two in place with the other hand. On the fourth tab, I like to carefully use the blunt rounded end of a fingernail file or similar device. Just maintain the other three tabs with one hand and slide the last tab in place with credit card.
 
With all the different revisions, is it safe to buy the he400 now?
 
No vendors that I know of have any old stock left.
 
Is the //MARK\\he400 too heavy for me?
 
For users of headphones like the Sennheiser series, these will seem heavier. After a few days I was able to adjust easily and I am quite sensitive to heavy hp’s.
 
Are the alternative cables available for the //MARK\\he400?
 
Of course. There are some great custom cable builders out there. Please consider: Norse Audio, Q Audio and Toxic Cables.
 
Is the //MARK\\he400 bad to leak sound?
 
Absolutely. They are like mini speakers. Everyone in the room will hear what you are listening to.

A solid mid-fi contender indeed. Looking forward to future headband/earpad comfort mods. Thanks for the review.
 
Edit:
 
As for non-modding comfort adjustments, what I've done were:
 
1) stretch the headband quite a bit (I stretched it completely flat for a good 2 minutes or so), it's spring steel so there's no risk of any real deformation or snapping
2) use the (well-hidden) sideways swivel adjustments on the earcups; at the beginning I felt too much pressure exerted to the front of my ears behind my cheeks, and not enough behind my ears, but after proper swivel adjustments it felt just right.
3) try removing the inserted foam cut-out rings from under the pads between the underside of the pads and the acoustically transparent earpad cover. it softens up the pads dramatically and increases comfort greatly if your ears are not huge (if they are huge then they'll press against the grill which is even more uncomfortable).
 
In my opinion, both a headband mod to increase the cushioning at the top of the head, and different earpads (Audeze LCD earpads maybe?) to increase earpad depth and/or softness, would potentially make discomfort a nonissue as all the weight would be more evenly distributed.

As I have had another 24 hours to absorb the sound of the //MARK\\he400, this is what I've found. They have burned in just a bit. They bass is now a little MORE impactful really.  Tighter and more present but still balanced with the rest of the sound. Use this rating for bass quality:
 
*//MARK\\dt990 7.5
*//MARK\\he400 9.0
//MARK\\d2k 9.5
 
The Beyer goes low but does not have the tremendous impact of the denon. The //MARK\\he400 goes just as low and has more impact and honestly is a really good balance for bass line. I have even been thinking that I could give up the //MARK\\d2k and use the //MARK\\he400 in it's place as one of my everyday hp's. Never thought I'd even think about that. I would speculate that the //MARK\\he400 will continue to cook and open up a little more every few days. Don't know where it will hit the ceiling though. This is a very impressive headphone. Just wish that it were about a 100grams lighter and it would be all that I'd ever use...

=============================================

Uhh, the first half of my post got lost when I hit quote...grr.  I'll rewrite it here:
 
As a new //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 owner, I agree with almost everything in your review.  They're very obviously darker than even //MARK\\HD650, and there is sometimes a timbrally "off" signature to the lower mids.  Orchestral strings for example can at first try sound somewhat wrong, too dark.  And yet every time I wear them, I find they grow on me more and more.  Despite being darker than //MARK\\650, in some ways they combine the warm, non-fagiguing easy to listen to sound of the //MARK\\650 with the highly detailed //MARK\\K702's treble and level of engagement and "alive" feel. 
 
I'm almost tempted to give //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 a try, since everyone seems to rave about how they're a whole different class of detail and neutrality and soundstage.  I keep thinking, if these are this good, what must //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 be like?  And yet the soundstage on the //MARK\\400 seems as big as, if not bigger than my //MARK\\K702 which is famed for being too big (not to me, but to many.) And I fear the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 could end up as fatiguing or more fatiguing than //MARK\\K702 since it's often described as "sparkly" and "treble first." The //MARK\\400's have a very cavernous feeling at times like I'm listening to the quartet from the back of a large, empty, concert hall in part from the darkness.  How could it get bigger?
 
Also the comments on how revealing they can be seem to run contrary to the "dark" sound, not in a bad way, and also make me think that despite everyone claiming them to be "mid-fi" compared to their bigger brothers, they're mid-fi in nothing but price. 
 


What intrigues me in addition to this comment, is that Bian hasn't gone out of his way to promote "//MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 as superior" or "//MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400" as "a new lower cost, lower end planar" but instead promotes //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 as being more sensitive, and promotes the new manufacturing process that makes //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 so affordable.  It makes me think that if //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 were made the same way and the silver cable, spare pads, and hard case were removed, they'd be able to compete at roughly the same price, just with two different signatures. 
 
Though that may explain what I find oddly enjoyable about them.  I've never owned B&W or other British speakers, but I have two JBL setups, and I love those Studio-L models for the money   They don't sound exactly the same, these are definitely warmer/darker in the lower mids, but perhaps they do both have similar signatures.

I don't think the ~1-2 kHz spike/dip is related to the timbral tonality.  That's purely voicing not frequency peaks/dips.  I suspect it sounds that way because it's supposed to sound that way, but it would be nice if it were more natural sounding right at that spot.  That dark timbre seems to be lower frequency than that.  The whole treble range actually seems quite natural to me.  It's the mids right above mid-bass but below "mid" that seem to have the funny timbre.  I can't say that, say, //MARK\\LCD2's which these are supposedly voiced similar to doesn't have the same timbral funkiness as part of its dark(er!) signature.  I haven't tried them.
 
I still get curious about //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500....but on the other hand, Head-Fi-ers and even Headfonia/Soundandvision commentators aren't always the most reliable for trusting the ravings of people.  Hyperbole (H-F?  Shocked!) may claim they're in two different classes, and yet I find myself still wondering, what actually gets "improved" in the others, and how can you tell if they're voiced entirely differently?  Neither is popular enough to have enough data to filter preference from fact, and aside from the 1-2kHz peaks, the response curve is VERY similar for both. //MARK\\500 has a smoother response curve, but that seems to be by design/voice.
 
Some could say //MARK\\500 is more detailed and accurate...but the comments here that //MARK\\400 is also highly revealing seems to negate that. 
 
What really gets me is the commentators that claim, interchangeably that the //MARK\\500 is more sparkly, the //MARK\\500 is more laid back, the //MARK\\400 has more natural mids, and the //MARK\\500 has more natural mids.  It's like cut & paste editorial! I don't know how one can deduce "better" between two headphones from the same company in the same build with different drivers of the same tech that are voiced entrely differently.  And in this case especially price may mean nothing since the whole point of the price is a new fabrication process not used on the //MARK\\500s.  I'd love to see what //MARK\\400's would have cost if they were built via the old fab and included silver and a box for the true comparison.

=============================================



Yeah, I know //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 and //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\5LE are sort or in the same trend of voicing, though I do imagine they're not quite voiced the same so it's probably not a fair comparison.  The reviews comparing //MARK\\400 to //MARK\\500, and especially //MARK\\500 have a habit of being self-contradictory in the description of terms, or directly conflict with each other.   A headphone that is described as both bright and sparkly, can't possibly be laid back.  "Laid back" is a statement directly stating it's not bright and sparkly.  Yet some of these commentaries do say so. 
 
I realize HifiMan has lots of contradictions, I'd describe the //MARK\\400 as both laid back and lively, but in no way sparkly.  The low end is a little laid back the mids are neutral-forward and the highs are slightly rolled off so as not to be fatiguing while still being detailed.  Ok, I can get that.  But bright & sparkly & laid back? 
 
It's not the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 I'm ridiculing, just to be clear, it's the reviewers covering them with contradictory terms as though they're not quite sure themselves what makes the difference in sound presentation. I've heard //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 mentioned a lot as a defacto //MARK\\HD650 upgrade.  And from the description of "laid back" that would be about riight.  And yet, the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 is supposedly brighter than //MARK\\HD650, while //MARK\\HE400 maintains the darkness (darker even) of //MARK\\HD650 while bringing the treble to life a little more. It's hard to keep track when comparing such differently voiced cans.
 
One thing I found interesting in common with all the reviews though was that everyone, despite self-contradictory descriptions, seemed to conclude that they like the //MARK\\400 more for every-day use, and even though the //MARK\\500, 6 are better for the "wow" factor, are lease pleasant for every day listening.  Reminds me of //MARK\\HD800 descriptions. And makes me wonder "why would I pay more for something I'd listen to less? :)
 
But of course, curiosity killed the Head-Fier...

Nice to hear someone say that.  You're not the first person that has, actually.  I liken it much to //MARK\\HD600 & //MARK\\HD650.  Technically //MARK\\650 is better, but don't tell that to a //MARK\\600 fan that can't stand //MARK\\650, and the same situation again on //MARK\\HD650 & //MARK\\HD800.   //MARK\\800 costs literally 3x more, and there's an unsurprising number of people that like //MARK\\650 far more.  And there's also the group that thinks //MARK\\800 is better for everything.
 
Headphones are a funny thing.  The prices are going up with alarming swiftness at the "high end", and yet all the high end phones are so polarizing.  I'm glad I started with //MARK\\400 first myself. I'm no basshead, but there's something amazing about the sound.  Had I gone with //MARK\\HE500 first, like you, I may have ended up looking at //MARK\\400.  I like laid back, I like //MARK\\HD650, but the more alive sound isn't a bad thing, and for that reason I've been listening to //MARK\\K702 more often than //MARK\\HD650.  //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 may be "just right" even if //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 is "more refined" or "more neutral'
 
Since you've experienced both, what would you say you like more about //MARK\\400 than //MARK\\500 (or disliked about //MARK\\500?)
 

 


Yeah.  The funny thing with Hifiman is they have a peculiar house sound.  They describe it as neutral & warm.  And the FR graphs of all their cans show them to be very similar across all models, yet by most accounts, each model sounds amazingly different from one another.  Far more so than the FR charts would indicate they should.  I like what they're doing with having different models geared towards various full size speaker tonalities.  It's a neat "something for everyone" strategy instead of the usual "good, better, best." It sounds like (even if the //MARK\\400's are "technically inferior", they're not promoting them as budget at all but as a different sound) the idea is "they're all the best, but they all are intended to have different presentations."  It's refreshing. At the same time they all share in their own way the "Hifiman house sound."  I can hear echoes of my //MARK\\RE-//MARK\\0s in my //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400s despite //MARK\\RE-//MARK\\0 being analytically flat.
 
I think they're confusing the critics though as they try to segment them by "tier" rather than by the actual sound.  And //MARK\\400 really throws them off.  We ALL are guilty of assigning dollar amounts to how good something is.  That //MARK\\400 isn't cheaper so much due to product placement but due to new manufacturing blurs the lines.  Until //MARK\\600 or //MARK\\501 or whatever shoots down in price too.

=============================================

I don't want to get into a comparison of the //MARK\\he400-//MARK\\500, as I've not had the //MARK\\he500 in a while and I don't want to rely on memory. For me, even a few minutes that it takes to switch out an amp and try the same headphone can leave me guessing. So several weeks without listening to the //MARK\\500 makes me skeptical about the comparison. 
 
The //MARK\\he400 is almost too heavy for me. The //MARK\\he500 is way too heavy. I have ordered a headband pad for the //MARK\\he400 to take some of the pressure off the top of my head and have high hopes for more comfort. Again, I don't think this would bother most people but it does me. 
 
I found the //MARK\\he500 to be unexciting, too dry and neutral. And yes, I know that it needs be amped properly...I had the //MARK\\LYR at the time. When I listen to the //MARK\\he400's, it just hits the sweet spot for me. It's full of energy and has the bass extension that I personally like. I love open headphones with good soundstage that still manage to have a good bass response. The //MARK\\he400's do that and so much more.

It's great for all rock music, where the imaging / instrument separation of these cans REALLY shines. You get a stunningly realistic 3D sense of how the band is physically set up and playing in-studio or live, and in well-mastered / recorded tracks, you could even distinguish where individual drums / different plucks of guitar strings are individually coming from. The vocals are dead-center and nicely forward, and with all the instruments going off all around, it's quite an experience.
 
Listening to Moonchild - King Crimson, right now. The cymbal hits are just so nice and real, gives me goosebumps.
 
For modern pop, it's very good also, especially with that tight deep bass. Mids aren't too lush so pop songs have great clarity, and treble is just smooth/dark enough that vocals aren't sibilant (pop music tends to be more sibilant due to poorer mastering) but aren't dull either.
 
In fact, there's not a genre that these do poorly on (edit: the only songs I don't quite enjoy these on are those of certain female Jpop singers...Hikaru Utada for example, something off about their vocals out of //MARK\\HE400's). Great all-rounder cans IMO.

I've been waiting for someone to ask about that. I think that it comes down to my sound signature preference more than anything else. The denon and beyers that I own are a touch bright. The audio gd and LD seem to roll off that treble just a bit and make it just right for my taste. But with //MARK\\he400's the LD rolls off the treble too much and you can't experience the wonderful detail and transparency they have to offer. The fiio seem to be more neutral and lets the //MARK\\he400's shine. Some have described the 400's "dark" and while I'm not sure I'd agree with that comparison, I do understand it. Most neutral amps will drive the //MARK\\400's perfectly.
 
It's also possible that with a different set of tubes, the //MARK\\he400 would sound great with the LD.  I hope I've made this clear. It's not exactly that easy to communicate.

A good analogy.  In many ways I'd almost think the norm would be opposite though.  The alive and zippy cans as the weekend spin, and the warm laid back cans as the daily grind. 
 
That's the think that keeps me from being too interested in the "superior" //MARK\\500's.   It's laid back.  Not that I'm not a big //MARK\\HD650 fan, I am, and for me there are absolutely times for that kind of relaxing sound.  But Since I got //MARK\\K702 I've found I more often grab them for most genres than the //MARK\\650s (well before the //MARK\\650s were blown), I think I tend to favor the more alive less laid back sound for most of my listening.  The //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 takes bits of both of them and makes a sort of "best of both worlds".  If I fix my //MARK\\650's up I'll still have those when I want a treat of laid back sound, and my //MARK\\702's when I want excrutiatingly neutral (which is surprisingly often.)  For my high end planars why not make them the every day cans?  Even if they happen to be the cheapest :)
 
I do laugh at how price influences the H-F crowd (including myself.) If the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 were $700 with a flaky cable and a hard case, and the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 were the new mass market priced ones with a reliable cable, I have half a feeling H-F would be abuzz with raves about how "//MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 has a great mass appeal mid-fi sound like the favorite mid-fi //MARK\\HD650s, but they just lack the personality, presence and character of the pricier //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400's with their dark, lush presentation, while having a fuller but less natural upper-mid section in comparison -- but for the price, if you don't need the vivid, liquid presentation of the more expensive //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400, it's a great bargain for planar tech at the cost of some loss of bass presence in a heavier, less comfortable headphone."     We know it's true...
 
 


Yeah the additional weight of the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 was one of the things that concerned me about them as well.  That and the "failure comes built right in!" silver cable fiasco.  The Canare with the //MARK\\400's is unwieldy and is arguably the single most microphonic headphone cable I've ever heard short of, maybe, the //MARK\\Super.//MARK\\Fi //MARK\\5 IEM, but there's no doubting the thing is robust and built to last   It does create both some nasty microphonics as the Y split ends touch, and makes a mess of tube harmonics at the amp end though.  Sennheiser still wins for reliable yet flexible, manageable, robust, and non-microphonic cables in the box.
 
Your description of the //MARK\\500 is exactly what I feared about it.  I do like dry at times, but I have //MARK\\K702 now for that.  I thought //MARK\\K702 had a huge soundstage until I heard //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400.  I still don't understand what massive soundstage //MARK\\500  must have if people complain //MARK\\400 is too small (yet //MARK\\K702 is too wide?)  But yes, if I want unexiting and relaxing, once I get my //MARK\\650's fixed up, I have those.  And they're darned good at it on //MARK\\Lyr.  If I want neutral, analytical, revealing, dry, //MARK\\K702 is amazing, IMO it poseses 80% of what people love about //MARK\\HD800's upper end and a natural solid bass as well.  If I were buying a SINGLE headphone setup, I may consider //MARK\\500 if I wanted to leapfrog the mid-priced options straight to summit-fi, and stick with a single presentation.  But it's much more fun to have a stable of different cans, and in that case, I'd want my "top of the line" to embody the best of my others at once.  And //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 does that.  The dark, lush low-end (that goes even lower) with the detailed and neutral mids & uppers from //MARK\\K70x but including the non-fatiguing rolled-off treble of //MARK\\HD650. Though at times the bass is a bit much, almost like a speaker setup with the sub tuned a little too loud for the speakers.  When I hear people complain that these don't have as much base as [insert closed can here] I'm convinced I don't want to try those   Turning down the volume solves that though and it all goes back into alignment.
 
(I disagree with the phrasing "mid-fi" in your review either for //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 or //MARK\\DT880/990.  H-F'ers commonly use that now, but a few years ago, //MARK\\650, //MARK\\702, and //MARK\\880 WERE Hi-Fi, while Summit-Fi was Stax and Orpheus.  It's become vouge to confuse highest-end products with the definition of Hi-Fi.  Almost everything talked about at H-F is Hi-Fi, not mid-fi.  Heck, //MARK\\650 & //MARK\\702 both ran for $450-500 back then, and that was pre-inflation, so in todays money, those cans were priced more similar to //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 than //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400.)  There are no mid-fi cans mentioned in this thread, anywhere.  They're all hi-fi! )  HD4xx....that probably counts as true mid-fi. 
 

 


 
I agree with most of what you said.  They're an amazing all rounder.  Every time I put them on and here that overly-dark tonal balance I want to hate them, then I adjust to it quickly and I end up liking them more when I'm done than I did the previous day.  They just keep growing on me and I haven't found a track yet I dislike on them.  Rock, jazz, chill/electronic/electronic-jazz, classical, baroque/quartet, opera (shockingly good here, it's the feeling of box seats on the rear balcony, and I'm not even a big opera person), world, "new age"....you name it.  Dave Matthews Live at Folsom Field is like being there.  Not in the front (where you'd get deafened) but out in the crowd.  //MARK\\K702 definitley gives the front-row vibe for everything.  It's a good pairing. 
 
As for comfort, I have mixed feelings.  At first I was thinking they'd never work.  They hurt, they were heavy and they clamped my ear sore in minutes.  After some fidgeting I've got them to the point that they're comfortable, actually comfortable, for at lest 2 hours, probably more but I haven't listened longer yet.  No mods at all.  Some tips I learned:
 
This depends entirely on the shape of your head, so you'll have to find the place that's right for you.   I put the headband VERY forward toward the front of my head. If you have a more pointed head it won't work, if you have a flatter head it works.  High foreheads need not apply.  I also keep //MARK\\K702 very forward, however //MARK\\HD650 has to sit back more otherwise the sound gets messed up (the joy of planars, the position of the ear cup has almost no effect on sound presentation....dynamics can be heavily altered by moving the cup.)
 
Also, are your hinges on the gimbel exceedingly stiff to the point they don't move around freely like on your Beyers, but rather take some force to move them?  A lot of the painful clamping seems to be the result of the cups not molding the hinges to your head.  That is to say the problem isn't pressure, it's unevenly applied pressure  I grab the cups and tilt them downward (grills angling more to the ground...or swivel them so the bottom of the cup gets angled more twoard your head than the top.   That fixed a lot of the early discomfort.  These (at least mine) have a much stiffer horizontal hinge than plastic frame cans. The advantage though is they stay in position once you set them until you take them off.
 
They're still heavy, nothing changes that, but with those changes I can very comfortably sit and nearly forget they're there.  They're more comfortable for the first 15 minutes than //MARK\\702 by virtues of the very stiff velour backing foam that needs the heat of your head before it softens and moulds to your head on the AKGs.  The only real trouble is not moving your head in fear of the stiff microphnic cable knocking around 
 


//MARK\\Lyr does very well with them, IMO.  I suspect Headroom amps don't do as well.  They're slightly dark amps.  I'll try mine when I send my //MARK\\Lyr in for service.  Your experience mirrors that of mine with my Headroom and //MARK\\HD650.  Too dark, too small a stage.  My //MARK\\Fiio //MARK\\E11 convinced me my //MARK\\650's could do more, so I bought a //MARK\\Lyr!
 

 


I agree, after all the description of being dark I was floored when I noticed so much treble detail and neutrality in the mids.  It's only half-way dark colored.  I've seen the "u-shaped" description of few times, and I'm not sure I agree.  The FR charts don't confirm that either.  It seems like a bumped low-end, a neutral mid-range, a peak & flat plateu in the upper mids to keep them above the bass, the infamous 1kHz dip, and then mostly flat before rolling off.  Effectively it's a very neutral Beyer/AKG like presentation above the bass, and a...something between Denon and maybe Sony bass end and a Sennheiser-like rolloff of he extreme highs and upper mids. Or as Fang refered to it, "American speakers like JBL."  Despite the bashing Harman/JBL often gets, JBLs voicing is still oh so cool, and most venues I've seen amplified live performances in were using JBL, so I've never had a problem with sticking to that tonality.  It's a very addictive blend of dark and exciting.  Usually dark is paired with laid back and exciting with bright.

I think you mean the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 (&6) has been shipping with silver.  My //MARK\\400's are the new batch and feature the Canare....and from what Headfonia said the //MARK\\400's don't take kindly to silver (the treble supposedly gets harsh and sibilant. Same goes for the velour pads.)

From what I've read the silver cable has a NASTY habit of falling apart at the connectors due to some heat shrink tubing problems or something to that effect.  Given the cost of bare silver, I'm not surprised corners were cut for an in-the-box silver wire.  I'd rather have the robust but unmanageable cable   AFAIK that Canare model is outdoor rated....no wonder it's inflexible solid core!   I imagine //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 will  go back to the Canare or something new once the complaints start piling up on the silver cables.
 
Neutrik connectors are nice, but I don't see much of a point for a bundled cable.  The idea of Neutrik is easy termination for custom terminations on bulk cabling and guaranteed good surface contact.  As long as the molded connector is connected well, I don't see an issue with it.  Sure you can easily swap connectors with Neutrik, but you could always just as easily snip the plug off the cable and stick your own Neutrik or solder or whatever on if you were intending to put your own connectors on anyway. I don't see "easily removed terminations" as a feature on a stock pre-cut cable as long as I have wire snips in the drawer.  Assuming I had any reason to modify the terminations to begin with (such as acquiring a balanced signal chain.)

No, in my response, I was strictly referring to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\5LE and not the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 or the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6.  Though, I've read of the silver cable and the questionable lifespan of that cable provided by HifiMAN.  Also, in my case with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\5LE, having the Neutrik connectors (especially the balanced 4-pin connector) was a very nice feature to have, since I was able to get the appropriate remaining compatible parts quite easily to build out some speaker taps.  I've also read of some //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400 users getting that silver cable packaged with their 'phones, too.
 
I saw a picture of an earlier //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\5LE that was for sale.  It appears HifiMAN had some nice looking black sleeves on the cable at the time.  I don't see that anymore - I guess either cutting production time or costs has led to the simplified cable processes.  Also, the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500s are selling for $200 less per pair ($699) than their original launch price of $899.

You're right, they're still pretty new and until your thread here and the one other there hasn't been too much discussion about them in general.  On top of that there's been so much focus on HE-500 for so long, and HE-4 was sort of a half-ortho so the HE-400 name isn't selling them all that fast, it'll take a little for momentum to swing around. Also, at least until HE-500's successor comes out with the new lower price-point on the new assembly, the fixed perception that HE-500 is the real ortho and HE-400 is the budget cut down ortho probably won't go away.  Heck the $50 price difference between HD600 & HD650 still has people warring over how superior HD650 is and not recognizing they're just two simply different cans at the same tier.  Here we have a $300 difference.
 
I agree about sound stage, it's simply phenomenal.  The classic, abused, audio-critic phrase "presence" comes to mind.   These have amazing presence.  The instruments are right in position, are outside your head entirely, and have so much substantial depth and realism about them.  Most argue the HE-500 has better soundstage, however headfonia also argued that HD650 also had, in actuality, more soundstage than K702 which I overwhelmingly disagree with.  There's just "something" about them that feels so tangible on most instruments. 
 
The separation amazes me as does the accuracy.  With the discussion of them being dark and the HE-500 being so much more accurate, it's easy to expect this to be inaccurate.  In fact they're as detailed and accurate, at least, as K702, and IMO with most instruments, much more so (in some places K702 wins just due to the completely flat FR that hides nothing at any range.)  But the separation of instruments is astounding.  The best I've heard. It is "next level", definitely.
 
My problem with "laid back" speakers is that they generally sound like speakers.  It's a sound that, while cool, doesn't exist in the real world.  A saxophone will never sound "laid back" unless you're hearing it from a distance, with a lot of objects in the way (like on the other end of a bar, or down a street, or over a balcony, etc.) where a lot of HF gets attenuated.  I think it depends a lot on how a listener listens to music, even when live.  Some people (folks that prefer laid back cans) probably like taking on the whole instrumentation as a whole, the band as a single unit and sitting back and absorbing it, and thus critics will talk about the "integration as a whole" in reviews.   I personally look individually at each musician and pay attention to what each is doing, each part of the whole, even live, so great separation is of importance to me, as is a "presence" and energetic sound. Wide separation speakers correlate to how I see live music.  I also think folks who listen mostly to vocals have a strong leaning toward laid back, boosted mids speakers, while those who listen mostly to instrumental may like a more energetic and forward (but not harsh) speaker. Those preferences play a role as well. 
 
Not that I don't like laid back cans, they're fun and relaxing, but for my planars, laid back won't do   Classical has that cavernous hall feel, jazz sounds as it should if you were at a nice round table with a candle on it somewhere in the middle of the room, live rock sounds like you're out mid-way through the crowd....positioning is fantastic.  It makes many things sound like a binaural recording even when it's not.
 
I still like K702 when I want a dry, airy, front-row sound though. And no planar so far is known for a front-row sound.
 

 


I agree, the strides are amazing.  When I bought my HD650's it was pretty much the crowned king short of Stax, and ortho was a word not present in audio vocabulary.  My how things changed. Getting the weight down without sacrificing response (thinks of HE-4) is the only remaining challenge.  And reducing the weight of multiple neodymium mags is a hefty challenge indeed.  But just look at HE-400, they got the famous power hungry orthos, the tech the 6W Lyr was built for, down from 2W to the ability to run on a PMP (sort of...) That's huge.
 
IMO, HE-400 should still be on that summit-fi radar, but at it's price, it won't be.  But I agree.  Summit has worked down from Stax and other $10k friends down to include planars, and the crazy new techs (Sennheiser's ring dynamic, which is more like planar than dynamic, and Beyer's Tesla coils.)  The one I don't get is HD-700.  The initial reports said they have a lot of the HD800 sound for 30% less money. But $1000 for a plain old dynamic that sounds almost as good as their flagship new tech, while it's running in step at the LCD-2's price and over the price of everything HiFiMan except HE-6 is just bewildering.  HD650 running at $500, where it was 6 years ago is also bewildering.  I think Sennheiser is going to bury themselves in downright disastrous pricing models.  It's a creative management decision to say "Hmm, lots of new tech has emerged to rival our market dominance and some of it is cheaper than our old tech.  I know, lets double our prices!  That'll show 'em!"  I love HD650, but I couldn't honestly recommend someone spend $500 on HD650 when they could get HE-400 for $400. Unless they were plugging it inot a Darkstar....that may make a difference. For $350, like it was a few months ago, HD650 is a steal.
 

 


Eek, I'm glad my 400's have the Canare.  Why the silver would be bundled with them I can't imagine.  Not only is the build quality questionable, but allegedly silver's a poor match.  And it no doubt costs them more.
 
I can see your point on speaker taps and the like, ok, but the HE-5LE really benefited from that kind of amplification.  HE-400's point is to not need it.  I don't think that would be a good idea on these! They sell a balanced cable for them, and I'm not sure what's running in that Canare, but I doubt it's difficult to splice your own speaker taps from it.  The thing's basically a pair of CATV cables in a jacket for crying out loud!  Or so I assume that the cables after the split are still Canare (he jacketing of the split side has no writing.)
 
It's kind of cool they're trying to branch out and include things like silver for us geeks, but if it's not going to be made right, keep the silver and stick with reliable copper please!  Including a huge name brand high grade cable in the box is honestly a huge thrill alone.  Getting into poorly soldered semi-precious metals isn't needed.  Cool idea, but poor execution.  Maybe on a dark amp the silver is helpful, though.

I'm not sure if it'll be regarded with an elite group of "mid-fi" (a word abused as much as "presence") headphones next to HD650, K70x, DT880, or if it will be regarded with the truly elite (HE500, HE6, LCD2, T1) but I agree, I think, as long as Fang gets out of his "I need to make a new headphone every week" OCD long enough to make a long steady run of the HE-400, it may go down in Head-Fi legend along with the classics, once it gains momentum. 
 
What I'd really like to see is for people to stop using the word "mid-fi" for former flagship headphones and any hi-fi set under $1000 regardless of sound.   I mean, seriously, in 5-10 years everyone on H-F will rave that LCD3 & HD800 are great mid-fi options if you don't want to step up to hi-fi prices.  The fidelity of the headphone doesn't decrease just because new tech exists to make something even higher-fidelity.  By that standard, so called "Hi-Fi" in the 60's was really just low-fi and entry-mid   I'm not sure how "normal hi-fi" shot up in a few years from the $500 range to the $1000 range and beyond. Maybe because the Beats & Skullcandy lines redefined the price point of low-fi to be the $400 mark for dollar store quality 
 
I haven't noticed any effects of burn-in, but I can't say there aren't any, I just haven't noticed it.  My feeling is that my brain is burning in more than the headphones, and maybe the pads are settling down.  A lot of HiFiMan owners have commented on positive burn-in across all models, so I don't doubt the effect is true.  And that could be contributing to my enjoyment, but I think that adjusting my brain from a lifetime of dynamics is more significant than the rate of burn-in in this case   Maybe in the first 4 or 5 hours there was some random funkiness that has fleshed itself out, but I never found anything lacking in staging, clarity and detail from the beginning.
 
Oh, and an update on my comment about "sometimes there's too much bass", it's really recording dependent.  It really is there only when called for.  Classical choral for example, the bass is quiet but present periodicaly just as it should be.  No boomy bassy vocals appear, and the double basses never rose above where they should.  It's all in the recording.  I continue to be more impressed with them.  That wasn't the best album for them, IMO but it demonstrated some of the technical aspects for me well.  (Berlioz: Requiems op 5, Telarc.)  Telarc is a great classical publisher, but in that album, something was off about the microphones.  The tenor sounds like he's across the parking lot no matter what speakers you use.

 


Yeah, they're in a really wierd slump.  They spent a long time churning out consumer mass market stuff that didn't live up to the name, but was better than the low end.  The HD650's dropped to $350 years ago, stagnated there for years, and now are suddenly back to $500.   They released the HD800 at a jaw dropping $1500.  I'd have predicted failure, but it has its niche,  it's the only place you can get the ring driver, and if you want it, you'll pay for it.  Ok, I get it, maybe it's a wise move to have a product placed there.   But the HD700 is both puzzling and disappointing.  When the rumor mill said it was a lower end ring driver for 1/3 the price, it was exciting.  "Wow, the HD800 tech is going to start propagating, slowly, into affordable headphones, it's the beginning of a new era.  The early previews said it had a lot of the HD800 going for it too!, the expensive prototype is now getting refined and moving mainstream!"  Then when we found out it was a plain dynamic that doesn't build on  the 6xx line's sound, but acts only as a cut down dynamic implementation of the 800's ring, without the stark treble (the 800's selling point.)  And then saw that the thing looks like it was cut from their DJ line, I couldn't help but think "they want me to pay $1000 for that?"  And then the HD650 went up to $500. Maybe to cover for the let-down of the HD700 so it doesn't seem like a ripoff. 
 
It's not that I doubt that HD700 is a very capable headphone, it's that the pricing doesn't jive, at all, with what it is.  And jacking up all their other prices back to their 10-year-old initial release price to make it look like it's in line is nuts. Imagine Fang selling HE-6 for $1300 in 2022? I don't buy it.  At $1000 there's a LOT of competition.   Competition that boasts new tech and claims the top crown in their category.  HE-500 (less), HE-6 ($1300), T1, T5p ($1300), for that matter HD800 ($1500), and D5000, D7000, the list goes on.  Plus Audeze.  Lets face it, for someone willing and able to spend $1000 on a headphone, spending $1500 on a headphone isn't going to break the sale. And Senn's big new $1000 toy is a refined normal dynamic that's biggest claim of success is it has similar sound to the flagship without all the benefits like angled drivers, planar sound waves, and sparkly ultra detailed treble.  Technologically it's the same tech as the HD650 that sold for $350 for years, just tuned and tweaked differently and I'm sure with refinements to the driver tech.  If it cost them half a decade and $650 more per unit to R&D that, there's something horribly wrong in their R&D department.  I suspect maybe more importantly they tried to cut the ring driver tech down, couldn't make it work at the price, and after two years of delays decided "lets just tune a dynamic driver to the 800's tone."
 
When small companies like Audeze and HiFiMan and get their new tech up and running in a few years and refine the process down to cut the price by 2/3 in that time and move their tech mainstream, one would think a company with the resources Sennheiser has could do the same, and crush them in the process.   Watching them stagnate and fail to make their tech more cost effective and at the same time raise their prices is very odd.
 
Unfortunately I think they're trying to "reposition the brand" to make it an elite "lifestyle brand."  Their mentions of designing phones after the look of German luxury cars says it all.  They want to position themselves as a designer product like BMW & Mercedes, and part of that proces is charging way more than the product should sell for and convincing people the name makes it worth it wih its luxury appointments. 
 
Unlike cars where people like using them to flaunt status, outside Germany (and away from Monster/Beats in the US) that won't fly with headphones, and (non-Beats) headphones are no status symbol outside headphone communities such as this.  It's a strategy doomed to fail.  When it backfires (and it will), I suspect we'll either see massive price cuts or a brand new affordable ring.
 

 


I'm still not certain I agree with "not as accurate."  I've heard that often, and I haven't listened to HE-500, so I can't say objectively what is true.  However listening to the accuracy of detail, the revaling of recording flaws, and the surprisingly even FR, of HE-400 I somehow suspect that if they are less accurate, they're not less accurate to the point of making an issue out of it.  I also supsect if they were both $700 we wouldn't be hearing the words "less accurate" very often 
 
Between HE-400 and HE-500, for electronica, dance, chill, the HE-400 is where you want to go without looking back, IMO.  The bass presence of HE-400 is fantastic, as is its accuracy and extension.  From all accounts I've heard, HE-500 does not have as present a bass (by design.)  The HE-500 in Fang's own words has the "polite" sound of British speakers.  Read: HD650, B&W, etc.   Now maybe you like "laid back" sound, which means generally a boosted focus on mids, and a roll-off of the treble and bass.  For many genres that works beautiflly, but electronic and dance are usually not among them.  I like electronic/chill on HD650 (laid back) more than K702 (analytical/flat), but I like it on HE-400 more.   HD650 (and by extension, HE-500) shines for vocalists, singer-song-writer and a lot of rock if you like your rock laid back.  It also does very well for jazz, & crooners, swing/big-band, and some classical).  It's very good for percussion, and surprisingly good for electronic, but not HE-400 good.  K702 is great for live jazz, classical (amazing for classical), and solo instruments, but doesn't excel for other things with much rhythm. 
 
For your debate, I'd forget the "accurate" part, that's not a critical part in comparing these two for your genres.  The HE-400 should be the strong winner for your electronic, and is an able performer for everything else including rock, unless you explicitly prefer a laid back sound for ether of those genres.  Think instead of both sets as the same price, think of them as equally accurate (true or untrue), and think of the HE-400 as dark, dynamic, smooth, and with rich, detailed bass.  Think of HE-500 as warm, brighter (but I doubt by any means "bright"), mids-centric, agile, but more mellow (less dynamic) in tonality.  Some call it "more refined", some call it "boring".   Or "alive and exciting" versus "clean and relaxing" (which would also work for chill/lounge.)  Pick the sound signature that suits your tastes.
 
Personally the images that come to mind with the laid back sound (HD650, HE-500) are:
Sitting in a "contemporary" designed up-scale apartment/house, in some fairly high-end or exotic place in front of a warm fire (in an art deco fireplace), sipping [insert beverage of choice] in a leather chair under halogen mood lighting listening to (very expensive) speakers on a snobish audio rig.
 
Or maybe listening from a distance to some street music while dining outdoors at a street cafe.  
 
It's a warm, refined, luxurious sound. 
 
The "alive" sound (HE-400, JBL speakers (as Fang compared them to):
At a live event listening to live music, not up front but "in the crowd" or in the middle or back of the hall for classical or mid-bar/restaurant for jazz. The idea here is recreating live music in a direct music presentation.
 
For electronica it's synthetic by nature, so there's no "natural" habitat for it.  Go with how you enjoy it or how your favorite venue voices it.
 
Though, If you want more bass than HE-400 I think you'll have to go to LCD-2 or Denon D7000

I can't say about extension of course, presence is a big part of it, and by spec HE-500 does go 10Hz lower, but wouldn't either larger presence or larger extension entirely defeat the nature of a laid back mid-centric sound?  It's the rolled treble and rolled bass along with the dip in the upper mids that creates a laid back sound, after all... I'd think though it may extend lower, it probably rolls off earlier and more steeply as well. You'd have to have it pretty cranked up to hear that additional 10Hz-20Hz range if so.
 

 


Amazon doesn't sell any HiFiMan gear directly, it's usually Kraft Street that has some through their fulfilment, so you may want to check with them.  They don't have their own web presence, but you could probably call their shop and see.   I know from another dealer that some shops it seems aren't getting shipments from HiFiMan of the 400's for some reason even though they've had them on order.  I think production is still a little backed up so direct customers get first priority probably followed by a handful of close retail partners.  It'll happen eventually, but HiFiMan itself is likely the bottleneck still.  
 
HD650's bottom end isn't very bottom, it's all mid-bass.  If you look at the FR charts AKG 70x actually has more sub-bass presence than HD650, but HD650 has that mid-bass hump right before it rolls the bass off a cliff that gives it that psychoacoustic feeling of more bass.  70x actually has a nice deep, solid bass.  It just doesn't have much presence with its mostly flat curve compared to something like HE-400. For me HE-400 is the best of HD650 and K702, though not quite in the order you're looking for.  It kind of has HD650's rolled top, but not quite as rolled, 70x's mids & upper mids, and a little into the treble (but rolls off faster than 70x), it has 650's lower mids, and a low-end like neither.  It's a pretty likable signature, and definitely richer than the analytical 70x and the warm soothing 650.  Though I imagine HE-500 is as well.

I'm usually cautious with statements like "does everything better" for two headphones voiced completely differently.  For example, it can't do HE-400's sound signature better, because it doesn't have HE-400's sound signature.   Fang was very clear about where he intended the signatures to be on each.
 
Comparing HE5LE to HE500, sure that statement is logical since HE500 is effectively the upgrade of a similar sound from HE5.   Same for HE-4 to HE400.  Each represents mostly a refinement of the previous, so I can see that kind of comment being accurate there. 
 
But in this context it's back to the "K702 does everything better than HD650, HD650 does everything better than DT880, DT880 does everything better than K702" circular argument.  They're very differently voiced headphones by design so they can't be directly compared as doing everything better.  They certainly probably do some things better, and you may like the things it does better as a listener.  But it could be a misleading comparison.  Someone looking for one sound signature or the other probably won't be thrilled with the other.
 
I generally understand what you mean, but like the 650/880/702 argument, personal preference plays a huge bias into what one considers "superior performance" from a handful of very different equally or near equally competent headphones. I'm not saying it may not be true that the HE-500 is "better" technically, but HD800 is better, technically, than many other headphones, but lots of people run screaming from them, and even many that swear by them wouldn't use them as their main headphone.   Matt found the HE-500 boring with their more laid back sound.  As an HD650 fan, I understand why he and others may be bored by that tone, sometimes I wanted more excitement out of HD650 as well.  Which is probably why Fang wanted to cover the more exciting sound with the HE-400, IMO he did  so marvelously in a way that a laid back can couldn't overshadow if one isn't looking for laid back.
 
Headfonia's conclusion was that HE500 & HE6 were technically superior, and had more wow-factor, but HE-400 were the preferred choice for everyday listening.  Sound and Vision's dual evaluation resulted in the comment I mentioned earlier of "I think HE-500 is superior, but if you said HE-400 was superior, I couldn't disagree."  Those are evaluations from folks who's job it is to compare audio equipment, and their objective result was a far cry from "x does everything better."  I don't always agree with the jaded critics (6 Moons ) but when they seem to form a consensus, it's an interesting pattern.  I'd say it's a good indication that HiFiMan is doing something very right in their lineup.

Oh yes, that's what I meant. I just want the two-day shipping and ease of returns! 
 
Regarding bass, I thought the HD650 gave a good "meat" to the sound, although it's bass wasn't the deepest extending or clearest. I really like the Q701's bass, but you can definitely tell it's the undermining spectrum of the sound. I just want something that absolutely does not sacrifice the midrange, but has a really nice bass to boot. And by "really nice", I guess I mean a real weighty and rich bass, that extends low and doesn't render some music as "too bass light". From what I can remember, the HE-500 did that spectacularly well, but the HD650 did alright too. I just remember thinking back then that the HD600 was the Q701 "fix", and the HD650 was the HD600 "fix". Loved the HD600's midrange, but ultimately liked the heftier sound of the HD650. Give me the bets of both worlds, and I'll have one heck of a headphone. So basically, I think I've worked myself into a corner, surrounded by the HE-400 and HE-500.
 


Agreed. "Better" can be a difficult word to use, because there are too many factors that rely upon opinion and preference.

Yeah, I often check Amazon first as well.  But I couldn't wait after my 650's fried   A was all set to get the HE-500 until the comments from a few people I usually agree with in terms of preferences told me that the HE-400 is more suited to what I was looking for.  They weren't wrong.
 
If you think HD650 gave "meat" to the sound, you haven't heard anything yet.  That's not to imply I dislike HD650 now, they have their place when looking for a laid back sound.  The mids are definitely less emphasized on the HE-400 compared to HD650 (where the mids on HE-500 would be fuller like with 650.)  That doesn't mean midrange is "sacrificed."  It's very natural, more natural than 650 which has an emphasized midrange.  And I may have spoken too soon, it may be more detailed than HD650's mids, but less pronounced.  It has the weighty and rich bass you're looking for, though, absolutely.  You will never be thinking "bass light" with HE-400, but it also is tight bass that doesn't bloom out of where it should (which HD650, in fact, sometimes  does...).  I like the AKG bass (K702) as well, it digs much deeper than HD650, and integrates into the mids better, but it has very little presence comparative to the mid-bass hump on HD650.  HE-400 takes the ENTIRE bass, puts it on a level near the mid-bass hump of HD650, and keeps it from blooming or bleeding similar to AKG.  HD600 midrange, HD650 mid-bass and upper-mid-treble, plus a little 70x bass control (with more presence) and a bit of the 70x treble (without dipping into fatiguing sparkle.)....sounds a lot like HE-400 to me! Not exactly of course, it has its own character....but that's the general vibe I get from them. It may not be exactly those criteria of course.
 
It's a headphone that always surprises because nothing is what it seems.  Just when you want to say they're bass heavy and a bit dark, you change your mind.  I put on a Telarc recording of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks & Water Music (Boston Baroque) on period instruments.  Very little bass, at all, ever, on the recording, all mid & treble with some midbass, and lots of fast counterpoint of 16th & 32nd notes (It's baroque after all...) and what struck me was now warm-neutral the headphones seemed.  Certainly darker than AKG's cold and analytical airiness, colored in that sense, but overall neutral and remarkably detailed.  It's a graceful yet energetic headphone, not not colored in the ways you'd initially think.
 


Yes, both the HE-5LE and the HE-500 are still available at the same price, but from most of what I've heard they embody the same general signature and share the "5" slot in the lineup. If anything I liken it to Beyer's "250 vs 600 ohm" setup.  Same general headphone and sound, but with tweaks one one model for bigger amps (HE5.) But the HE-500 seems to contain the newer designs, so it may well be an upgrade, even if it's a slightly different upgrade. I imagine they do sound slightly different due to the gold vs. aluminum difference alone.  But they are variations on a theme from my understanding.
 
HE-4/400 though I agree.   What they share is that they're the lower cost option, and they both share the position of being the more "fun" sounding can in the lineup.  They still sell the HE-4 as well (for more money due to the old manufacturing process.)
 
I wonder what the HE-600 will cost? :P
 
 

 


Headfonia seemed to think the velour, like the silver cable made the treble too harsh, though it made the lows & mids more neutral and detailed.  Then again, Headfonia thinks HD650 has a bigger soundstage than K701 
 


Right, but both the deeper and higher extensions is printed right in the spec, so there's nothing surprising about that.  5Hz deeper and 15kHz higher.  Of course that higher range is all in the UHF and well beyond both human hearing and Redbook audio, but it gives us an idea that the audible part probably extends to a higher frequency utilization.  And 5Hz depth is definitely perceivable.  However, the rolloff for the laid back sound should still roll a bit more sharply, at both ends, otherwise it wouldn't have the "polite" sound it is intended to have.
 
The K702 can dig deeper than HE-400 in terms of FR as well, but in terms of quantity is still bass shy next to HE-400.  That doesn't mean it doesn't have great bass, it does contrary to popular AKG myth, but it's not as present. 
 
It's not the capabilities of FR that I doubt in HE-500, but the utilization across that frequency range would have to be reduced in order to maintain the intended sound signature.  It's not a strike against the HE-500 in any way, It's just part of what is needed to create the "laid back" sound signature it's supposed to have.

It's hard to say which you'd like better between HE-500 & 400.   If you know you really like the 500, it could end up being the winner.  But if you're looking for something a little more "exciting" or something more dark (650's are darker than 701, and presumably darker than HE-500.  HE-400 is darker than 650, as a point of reference) you could easily like the 400's even more. 
 
It's so easy to get lured into the 400 vs. 500 debate.  I'm certainly sucked into it.  It's the worst kind of headphone debate (best for customers, worst for trying to win the argument) because there's no actual winner when comparing two radically different sound signatures.  All the technological aspects may well be entirely superior on HE-500.  But technologically superior doesn't always mean more preferable.  There's not a better HE-400 sounding headphone than HE-400, I'm sure.  I doubt a Grado fan would really dig LCD-3, despite their substantial technical superiority, for example. I think it comes down to how each individual listens to their music. I think your last sentence summed it up: you'd probably love either one!
 
I do use the pleather with the HE-400.  The 400 in fact only ships with the pleather, where HE-500 ships with both.  Like I said above, Headfonia tried both and found the treble became harsh on 400 with the velour, and I suspect the odd looking FR chart for HE-400 involves tuning them around the pleather pads to get the bass & mid emphasis pleather gives while spiking the upper mids so they're still crisp and balanced after the pleather is done attenuating it.  I'd think if you change out the pleather, you're really changing the damping the driver was tuned for to achieve the unique "dark lows with neutral mids & highs" sound.  HE-500 works with either because it's tuned for that mids-centric neutral tone. 
 
I'd be curious to try the velour though for myself...they're only $10 when you can find them available... I have heard the velour uses harder foam so I imagine the comfort would be like AKG: uncomfortable at first, very comfortable when it heats up.   The pleather is very comfortable at first, but where it makes skin contact I do have to move them around a few times over the course of an album.

Yeah, I haven't got the slightest clue. From what I've read, I may just like the HE-400 more. But again, I probably couldn't go wrong with either one, and the price tag on the HE-400 is definitely easier on the wallet. It's about time I get back into magnificent orthos again. Still remember back when I got the HE-4. Good times. (I was amazed at how horrible the HD598's bass sounded in comparison). But then again, I should probably expect them to release yet another contender soon, to complicate things even further. Personally, I think they may re-touch dynamic driver, and make a superior version to the HE-300. Or maybe they'll create a new series, like the *000 series. Either way, hopefully they pop up on Amazon soon.
 
I personally find AKG's foam the most stiff. From what I remember, the HE-4 and HE-500 velour I used was in-between AKG and Beyer for softness and comfort. Can't speak on their newest velour though.

While it's anyone's guess, it seems to me their main focus right now is getting prices down to affordable levels, getting power requirements down, covering all the sound signatures and price points, and ramping up production.  Given feedback from critics and customers I think they'll probably slow down on the "new model every few months" mentality.  I do expect to see something in the extreme budget range at some point to keep in line with their IEMs.  I don't think we'll see another $1300 behemoth.  I imagine we'll see an HE-600, but on the new fab at much less cost,  Maybe an HE-7 to fill the $1000+ range.  I imagine an HE-501 or 550 will eventually come out on the new fab, similar-to 500 at a lower price.  I would think now that they have the first mass production ortho line, at least since Yamaha in the 80's, they're going to try to take full advantage of that.
 
HiFiMan's strength right now seems to be getting the next-gen tech out at prices that were seen as reasonable a few years ago.  While Audeze is content being a low volume two-trick-pony with boutique refinement (wood & genuine leather) that sells to the exotic crowd, HiFiMan seems to be trying to go the other way and ramp up to a more "mainstream" (well, "mainstream" as it relates to audiophiles, anyway) brand.  I'm guessing they want to try to achieve some form of market dominance in the audiophile sector before the big names start moving their new tech down the price ladder at some point (Beyer's Teslas, Senn's ring drivers, etc.)  They probably have several years to do that.
 
It's just my completely unscientific analysis, but a logical one, and the direction I'd be going if I had the first high volume planar factory in existence....
 
 
I've heard the newer HiFiMan velour is indeed more comfortable than the old ones, but I can't say from personal experience.  I think I'll wait for someone else to try it.  I kind of like the feel of the pleather, believe it or not.

I have never been a huge classical fan. Occasionally I'll listen to Mozart of Bach, mostly to be educated about the genre of music. But I haven't really enjoyed it until I listened with the he400's. I believe the realism of the instruments and the sound stage that these headphones produce is what's made the difference. I've listened to more classical in the last week on the he400 than I have in the past six months easy. 
 
Today it's Haydn. The sound of the orchestra is so life like and transparent that the experience itself changes altogether.You can close your eyes and you're there. I do not get this experience or enjoy this genre the same way with Denon or Beryers. The stringed instruments, particularly the violin is incredible. You an feel the passion being expressed through the instruments. Truly incredible. 
 
If you are a Haydn fan or a fan of classical and have the he400, you really need to give "Symphony no. 60 in C Major" a listen.

I'm using the stock Chinese tubes with my EF-2A.  However, I do guess that one could get into some tube rolling if a desired change in the sound was needed.  But, the stock tubes do well with my Fostex, so I don't want to use another set at the moment.
 
I'm not trying to imply that the EF-2A doesn't mix with the HE-400 in a horrible way.  I am implying that while HifiMAN has coined these headphones as efficient orthodynamic headphones - which they are when compared to the others in their lineup, I think the HE-400 really reaches its potential with a more gutsy amp and source plugged into it.  The EF-2A sounds good with the HE-400s and my iPod classic with a LOD cable.  However, when connected to an amp or receiver with speaker taps ... is where the fun really starts.  Also, don't poo-poo the HE-400s because of my response and experience.  Believe me, I do like mine and hopefully, will like the new pair that HifiMAN sends me as replacements in a week or so.  
 
I believe almost any headphone will sound "good" with nearly any amp.  However, in order for the headphone itself to reach its best potential, then the source and amp have to be considered for proper "great" sound.
 
Enjoy!

Very nice.  I happen to be a huge classical fan in general, and have listened to a lot of classical on a lot of speakers, and can definitively say that these are my favorite in that genre now as well (which is the one genre I expected to never use them with when I bought them!)  Previously K702 was my favorite for classical since it does a lot for the high end what HD800 supposedly does.  I still do like what K702 does for the genre, it's great for critical analysis of the music, and gives a very dry observational overview of the sound for when I'm interested in the technicalities of a given performer, or the subtleties of a certain orchestra's rendition of one piece or another.  But when I want to just listen, which is the majority of the time, the HE-400 is it.  It renders everything beautifully.
 
You mentioned Hayden, I'm curious, was your recording a modern orchestra or a period ensemble?  These headphones do amazing things with period instruments and staging, which is a very hard sound to get right! Violins, for example, were fewer in quantity, individual volume, and had a slower resonance on the true gut strings giving them a more whiny, but gutteral sound versus the smooth modern orchestra.  Not that these aren't fantastic for modern orchestra, but the point is it's harder to find a good can for period than it is for modern.  These do great with both!
 
Only catch to modern orchestra (Hayden's "Surprise Symphony" excluded as a period piece (if you're not familiar with it, he basically was ticked at his patron and audience for falling asleep at his performances, so he wrote the "Surprise Symphony" to get quieter and quieter, lull them into a sleep, and then "SURPRISE" he'd blast them back to attentiveness .  Probably the only symphony written for sheer spite, and we headphone enthusiasts pay the price....it has all the dynamics of a modern score.  ) Is orthos are quite dynamic.  And I'm running it on Lyr which is quite dynamic.  The lows are at times barely audible, and the highs can be ear shattering, so for classical I keep my hand near the volume dial.  Some of these recordings use the full 92db DR that Redbook has to offer...
 

 


As I see it, I suspect once the new fab is fully running for the successors to HE-500 & HE-6, those will both move down in price range.  I'm guessing HE-400 and HE-500 (or the future equivalent of each) will run basically together at the same price point, with 500 maybe $50-100 more, like HD600 & HD650, HE-6 will move down to HE-500's price point, and that will leave the $800-1500 price range open for new state of the art models.  That's my guess for the long-range future, but Fang likes to throw us curveballs it seems, so he may come up with a model from some entirely different direction.  He's a tough one to predict!
 
I think "laid back" tuned headphones tend to sell for a premium simply because it's a sound signature that is mostly dedicated to a relative niche of fans of the sound, so they're willing to pay for it. 
 


So, 2014, then?
 

 


 
70x can be surprising of you listen. There's crazy extension there, but it's unfortunately so very flat and thin that you don't notice it unless you're looking for it.  It's both one of the strengths and weaknesses of 70x.  it's so flat no part of the spectrum is extremely tangible at any time.   I agree that the printed spec doesn't tell us all that much direclty, but between the lines it does.  Usually when a headphone has a smaller range, especially smaller than common, it tells us that range was not the priority in the design, and less than what is stated is probably lesser.  Not always but it appears true more times than not.
 
But extreme frequency rolloffs (and more to the point, rolloffs before the extreme) have much to do with laid-back sound.  That's most of the laid back sound.  That's not to say it doesn't still produce a lot of information at the poles, but by definition it has to be very subdued at those poles in relation to the mids.  Otherwise it wouldn't sound laid-back, it would sound energetic or forward or both.

 


I still haven't tried it on anything less than my Lyr yet.  One day I'll give them a shot on my Headroom Micro as well.

Interesting you'd say that.  I'm guessing you have a different view of JPop than the Japanese.  Audio Technica's cans are voiced with the classic Japanese speaker voicing.  That is, they're all in the high end, lean, clear, and not full at all, with clean but often non-present bass. 
 

 


For me, Schiit Lyr & Bifrost fed by S/PDIF coax for a Squeezebox Touch.   Beautiful combination so far.   I'm fond of the stock GE's with all my cans, but I'm having some reliability issues with them making me reconsider a venture into the tube rolling thread to see what may have better reliability but still be neutral and clear.  I've had two pairs of those tubes falter with less than 400 hours use despite the 5,000 hour rating, and both became very microphonic sooner than that.  They're cheap (for tubes) so it's not a crisis, but it's irritating buying 2-3 to get one good one. Even if doing so is still cheaper than half of the more famous tubes out there for a single set.
 
It's funny, I started looking at orthos mostly because I had an amp designed for crazy ortho power delivery, so "why not?"  And I end up buying the only ortho that doesn't need that power   Like the HE-400, the Lyr & Bifrost rarely dissappoints. The fact that with the right tubes it's popular with HD800 owners says something. That's the pickiest can on the planet. Well, when it blew apart my HD650s it dissappointed, but that's a different matter (and it's a matter that I'm starting to discover may have been more tube related than amp related, but I need to conduct some experiments first.)  I still wouldn't trade my Lyr for anything under $1000   And Bifrost via S/PDIF anyway, is quite a clean DAC, especially for the money.  The combo is very neutral, or slightly bright of neutral, which is a fantastic match to the dark HE-400.  It was designed strongly with LCD-2 in mind....so it's a great pair for dark cans.
 
I have a Headroom Micro around, but I haven't tried HE-400 on them yet.  I was never pleased with it for HD650, also dark, but I've heard it's good for K702.  I do suspect Headrooms are a better match for inefficient low-impedence headphones more than high-impedence 650s.  HE-400 may be efficient compared to HE-6, but they're still fairly inefficient headphones.  Moreso than K702 which is relatively inefficient on its own.
 



+2, both.  That's exactly what I've been thinking.  I keep thinking maybe, someday, I'll add HE-500 to see what the buzz is about, maybe I'll have to....maybe I'll...maybe....no.....no these are perfect.
 
I'm curious about the others, but I have a hard time thinking about paying 2-3x more for a headphone I'd use 70% less often!  My K702 are already collecting dust (but I'd never ditch them), and my HD650s, I'm almost thinking of not buying replacement drivers for.  I can't imagine often using them.  I may still do it, but these are just so addicting.  I think I would use these 70-80% of the time and switch out only for something different.   Unlike other headphones I can't swap these out and say "for this type of recording I have to use the other headphones".   I've yet to find a genre they don't render better overall than both 650 and 702.  Previously I'd use 650 when I had something more vocal or percussion/bass filled (chill, worldbeat, jazz vocals) , and K702 for classical, live jazz, etc.  Now...this is my first choise across the board, and the other two are only for if I want a different presentation overall. 
 
I agree entirely, the biggest feeling is the feeling of not needing an upgrade.  Not finding expected faults or irritants.  Maybe these really are the upraditis cure.  We think of upgrades, put them on, then think of not needing an upgrade.
 
Perhaps, this time, we're sorry about your wallet, Head-Fi & sponsors! 
 

 


I'm still working on the comfort thing.  One thing is certain, the headband needs to be stretched, loosened, and shaped.  I'm working on that, and it does wonders both for comfort and for sound (less pressure means the foam compresses less which means the drivers sit a hair farther from the ear: more sparkle, wider stage, and dare I say, a little lower reach as well, at the expense of a slightly drier midrange!)  The only trouble is the metal band always wants to mold back to its old shape, so when I pick it up again it's compressing again.  And I don't want to actually weaken the metal by trying to stretch it too often...it takes a good bit of abuse to try to shape it so I'm not too fond of re-trying.
 
I'm thinking leaving it stretched over a wider object for a few days instead of hanging it from the stand may train the metal better.  Once thats done I'm thinking they may become one of the most comfortable cans in the collection if the early stretching results are any indication.
 

 


I can see it for HE4, 5, 6.   But even then, and especially with 400 & 500, if an AVR has better amplification performance than your headphone amp, I think it's time to invest in a better headphone amp    My AVR is nice, but my Lyr runs circles around it in terms of total performance (obviously, not for total power.)   That's a lot of attenuation to be applying to the gain to get it down to <2W output.

Absolutely.  When you look at the spec and the reality of them, an "efficient ortho" is not really the same thing as an "efficient headphone."  The K70x is already known as a pretty inefficient can that really sings when you give it a lot of power.   I seem to have my volume dial set up higher most of the time for similar volume with HE-400 than K702. 
 
I think people get caught up in the "drives it loud enough" argument to miss the "does it drive all frequnecies loud enough" argument.  Almost anything can get anything "loud enough" but non-linear response curves means that while it may be loud enough, the ends of the spectrum may be dropped off a cliff in the process, and the impulse response control with it.
 
It's nice to have the ability to drive it off an iPod as an option in case I wish to use it that way, but they aren't IEMs, they're huge magnet arrays. They need real power, and even if an iPod can drive it, it'll sap the battery in a very brief time.
 
And even for IEMs, TF10 for example, they sound very good out of an iPod, but when I first tried them on an E11 I was astounded, the detail and stage really opened up.  That probably has more to do with output impedance, but it's no less important.  SE535 on the other hand doesn't have as much difference on E11, and picks up quite a bit of hiss.
 
Still, speaker spades on HE-400 seems like overkill.  Heck, Lyr is overkill, power-wise.  
 

 
I missed the story of yours, were they the first batch with the driver fuzzing out issue?
 
I can sympathize with your fear of warding others away from a good product due to a bad experience.  My "Lyr killed my 650's thread" turned into a "lets bash those dangerous Lyrs" thread in short order.  As though anyone is unaware that a manufacturing defect of a severe enough nature on a 6W amp wouldn't have the capability of breaking something any less than your speaker taps. Fact of the matter is, it's still an awesome amp with impeccable sound and robust build.  A handful got out with some lurking bad components (or maybe just bad tubes, still doing some tests for a week or two.)   I still have faith in the product (my second one is just fine, always has been, other than a tube that went noisy), and still recommend it.  Much like you and your 400's no doubt.

Sure! It maybe a few days (or weeks) until I get to it but I'll give them a spin the next time I'm sitting at that rig while ripping CDs!  I imagine it'll be a better match than HD650 was (impedance), though it could still be slightly dark. 
 
My Micro is the "desktop" configuration from the original series about 5 years ago or so.  So if you have the portable (9v) configuration of that older series, it may be different.  The newer portables are different with a Li-Ion battery.
 
 


Unlike most dynamics, yes.  But that doesn't mean the current draw or even voltages are constant across the spectrum.  After the reports that on a selectable gain amp, the HE-400 sounded more anemic at the lower gain setting than the high gain setting, at the same volume output, I'd say there's probably a surprising voltage swing requirement for a low impedance headphone.

I wouldn't dream of using the headphone stage of an AVR!  I've used it a few times with my HD650's.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good.  The Denon headphone stages are nicer than the Onkyo ones though. 
 
Are you using an AVR or an integrated amp?   I can't speak for integrated amps, but AVRs generally have modest-at-best DACs, and if you're using an outboard DAC into the pre/power amp, they generally have even worse analog in stages (Marantz and HK excluded actually). 
 
Obviously, you already had the amp around, so you're way ahead of the curve price-wise of buying a dedicated head-amp, but my headphone Schiit cost quite a bit less than my AVR!  Actually I think I got my Denon 2310ci as $700 closeout when the 2311ci was released, a great price for a good AVR, not the best, but pretty darned good.  Lyr + Bifrost is a bit pricier, but if you're not getting into really good dedicated DACs, the Squeezebox DAC is pretty good on its own....no reason not to just get an amp with it.  It's a heck of a lot more convenient, ant a lot safer. No tone controls though.  And variable loudness...I do use that feature on my Denon for certain content since I have my speakers set up as monitors, but that usually is gain control in the digital domain, which means bitrate conversion in most cases.  For critical listening, I turn it off.
 
Something tells me, though, that if it wasn't homebrewed, you just won't enjoy it as much   But for me, my 6w amp has caused enough trouble for my headphones (note that may be tube related).  I'll be darned if I'm going to hotwire the things to a 105w amp!    That might almost be enough power to feed the HE-6 though....

I fear the day I'll have to do it, but it can't be worse than the nightmares I've heard about the old HE-5 pads with the 4 long tabs that were darn near impossible to insert without cracking the pad ring.  The new design looks like a much better system.  The new ring is also a much softer much more flexible plastic.  The old ones were stiff, brittle plastic. If you break a tab off the pads though, they're only $20 a pair, so it's not the end of the world (unlike AKG's $40 EACH pads....) Still, I plan to avoid it until needed.
 
I'm not fond of Sennheiser's system either, in all fairness.  They're friction fit pads on a plastic disc that you jam into the frame.  They come out easily enough, but putting them back in generally involves crushing/pinching the foam smashing them in, and every time you push the one side down, the other pops up.  It requires a disturbing amount of force to fit both sides at once, and I managed to create a thumbprint deformation in the metal grill in the process.  I can't see the imprint but I can feel it.  It kind of bugged me, until the drivers got fried a month or two later.  The thumb imprint doesn't bother me so much anymore!

If $16, shipped, for a pair of earpads is "ouch", whatever you do, do not look toward Senn and AKG.   Senn pads are generally $40-60 shipped for a pair and AKG runs $40-45 PER PAD, UNSHIPPED.
 
I don't know what Audio Technica charges but the lack of seeing them in the wild leads me to believe it's some exotic custom order thing.
 
HiFiMan has the cheapest pads around, anywhere.
 


 
How old were your HE500's?  The early HE-500's shipped with a totally different earpad system that's been discontinued.  The response to the original system resulted in yelling, screaming, and general disdain, and a lot of cracked pad rings.
 
The headphones I don't believe changed, just the pad assemblies.  The old ones (with the older, thinner velour pad) had the old system with the big huge plastic tabs on the stiff, brittle ring.  The new ones (new thicker velour and pleather) have the tiny wing tabs on a softer, bendable plastic ring. If your HE-500 was old enough your pad is the old style pad with the long tabs and the brittle ring (and the shallower, less padded velour.)
 

 
I would suspect that the neutral mids would lend themselves very well to atmosphere.  The neutral mids may not be ideal for lots of dialogue in movies though.  It would sound good, but may be harder to hear or require more effort than a mids-boosted lush can.  Hard to argue soundstage though!

Okay, I'm about two hours in with the new pads and I have to say that I'm really impressed with the improvement in sound quality. Here is what I hear:
 
Sound stage is even bigger-goes beyond shoulder width and now has a somewhat 3d sound. I can hear and locate each instrument and listen to it individually. It's also more layered. I don't want to oversell this really. I just didn't expect much from a pad change. 
 
Bass-was expecting a fairly good drop of here. Nope...not at all. No loss of impact and it goes just as low. The only difference is that the bass is just a little tighter. Now I'm a self professed bass head trying to be an audiophile. So I wasn't excited about giving up any bass. With that said, I have no issue with the change here, it is actually better for me. 
 
Comfort-The velours are a nice upgrade on the comfort. It's softer on the ears and now less fatiguing for longer listening. These pads do not however seem to breath as well as the Beyer pads. Not bad but just a little stuffy compared to the Beyers. The velours are about 1/4 thicker so they move the driver that much away from the ear. This is probably where the improved sound stage comes from. 
 
Then there was one thing about the change I couldn't quite put my finger on. Something familiar now about the way the he400 sounds after the pad change. Then as I was writing this it dawned on me...the he400 now sounded reminiscent of the he500. With the stock pleather, they had more of the american signature sound with a bit more bass. But now the "quality" of the mids and highs reminds of when I owned the he500. I would consider this a complement for what it's worth.

Interesting impressions.  I'd be interested in hearing an HE-500 to HE-400 comparison directly with velour to velour and pleather to pleather.  Especially sinc eHiFiMan has been sort of promoting the pleather as the upgrade for both.  In cerrtain areas I imagine there's a similarity with the change...the dark timbre would change, the bass my lighten, and the highs would be less attenuated.  But I supect that they wouldn't rreally ound that much the same side by side.  The different driver geometry and magnet setup would still make them fairly different, and the rolloffs and treble spike/plateau are going to make them different.  
 
Like I saiid before, my guess is that the HE-400 were tuned to use the pleather specifically had has specific spikes in the treble range to compensate for the pleather attenuation.  The 500 lacks those spickes and thus proobably plays nicely with the fvelour without any off tone.
 
But it's good to hear you see the velour as a positive.  It makes me curious to try as well.
 
I suspect what you're hearing has MUCH to do with distance from the ear.  Like I said, the sound got far more neutral and "reference" like when I relaxed the tension and got the rather squishy pleather farther from my ear.  Especially the reduction in frontal crushing force.  I think most of the "off" dark tonality came from not having enough air between the driver and the ear.  I did, by disttancing the pressure, with pleather part of what the velour automatically does through stiffness!

I would think filing it is the only way to do it, at least the only way that doesn't involve putting the metal to a flame!  I'm sure it can be done, just be sure to cover the speaker assembly so the fine metal dust doesn't make it in, but a set of coarse diamond files and some very bad hand cramps would probably get it done.
 
I just checked both of my pairs and the tabs are even on all 4 cups, so yours is the odd one here.  And for me, putting the rotation all the way back on both sides is essential for proper fit, and I'm thinking proper soundstage (all those benefits everyone is talking about with the thicker velour.)  Technically the staging/positioning is better without the cupst tilted back (it gives more the effect of angled divers) but the comfort issues involved negate any benefit.  With the cups angled back, and some bending/loosening of the band, they're actually exceedingly comfortable for long durations.  Better than Senn and AKG.  Not qquite as soft as AT. 
 
If you're getting frontal pressure/crushing of the foam, I say bring out the diamond files, the improement in comfort is worth it.   If you're note getting frontal pressure/crushing of the foam, don't bother, they're probably set where they need to be for your head.

(P.S. sory again for the typos in this thread.  This computer really hates me!  I ended up typing most of this entirely off screen!)

 
I definitely see what yo mean and I agree about different experiences.  I'm surrprised to hear you ay that 400 and 500 are not different enough when the 50 is heralded as the offspring of HD650 with the laid back mids sound.  HE400 is sort of the "anti-650" in everything but its dark signature and notable bass presence.  You've tried both, I haven't, so I have to go on your descriptions.  But from all other descriptions I'e heard, they didn't sound all that similar to me.  The simple fact that they're brighter changes the equation a lot.
 
Keep in mind I also have K702 which is a rradically different presenttation and one I like a lot...yet iI find I'm using them less and less since I got40.   Though d2x....you must be a bass head! :) 
 
I'd considered d5x, but I don't know about closed back cans.  The only reason I would have an interest in closed backs would be for isolation if noise is preventing me from listening properly to opens.  And if isolation is an issue I do already have very nice Sure SE535 IEMs.  And Triple Fis.  Not quite the same presentation as nice closed backs.  But with two nice IEMs and a set of noise cancelling, I have a hard time pulling the triger on any closed back can purely for isolation.  Though I'd have an easier time with it were it to suddenly be a noisy day!
 
That leaves the only other cans I have an interest in as LCD2 (too similar to 400 with the dark signature), T1 (too pricy), and HD800 (way too pricy).  And HE6, but that's the same argument as HE500.I
'm 
also 
very sensitive to treble and very fatigue prone.   My fear with T1, and evn HE6 is that fatigue.  IMO, HE-500 would still be fatigue free, give me the natural sound with a slight fun twist I like about HE-400 with a different presentation (laid back.)  But from what you say, it's not really that different a presentation?

Okay several things...
 
1. I'm really not that best person to take an evaluation from on the he500. Comfort is paramount to me as I'm sensitive to clamp and weight. The 500 is just too heavy for me to really enjoy. And I was too nervous about bending the headband given the price knowing that I would sell it. It was a weird experience. Early in my HF journey, I snagged the he500 and LYR . I had no idea what I had really. I had started reading about planar and HFM and was immediately drawn to the product. But they were not that comfortable enough and I didn't give them the proper audition they deserved. I just knew that they were uncomfortable and that I'd sell them. 
 
Then I started reading about the he400 and knew instantly that I'd buy it. The lighter weight and more prominent bass were right up my alley. Its a perfect fit for me. I still see the 500 listed in the forums and I'm tempted to buy it again but I'll never get away from the comfort problems. 
 
2. The denon series is just an amazing hp IMHO. For a dynamic closed phone it does so many things well. The sound stage is very good for a closed phone. Comfort is stellar. It has great detail in the upper register and is driven by any amp. Fiio e10 rocks out with the d2k. How's that for amping and dac'ing your phones for under $70? And then there's that luscious bass. Hell yea, I'm a bass head. Not all the time though. Just when I want to listen to tracks with a hard bass line. But then the denon are so good that sometimes I'll even listen to them for aoustic, jazz or classical. Yes, they're that good. And I can wear them for hours on end. Sometimes I don't want the whole house to hear my phones and the closed works pretty well for that. The difference between the 400 and 500 is evolutionary. But the difference between the 400 and d2k is glacial. 
 
If you really want to hear an educated opinion on the 500's you need to talk to MalVeau. The 500's seem to be his everyday go to can which he pairs with the LYR and loves. Mal promised a nice review of the whole HFM series, 300/400/500 but I'm still waiting. Did I miss it?

I agree with your impressions word for word.
Pretty much every genre of music I've listened to on the HE-400s has been brilliant, except for rock which seems to be hit & miss depending on the recording.
 
 
My top 3 genres for the HE-400s are:
 
1. Goa Trance - Deep basslines, atmospheric synths, psychedelic vocals and catchy melodies all meld together so beautifully that I'm often closing my eyes and drifting off into another realm.
2. Jazz/Accoustic with vocals - I'm not the biggest fan of this genre as none of my previous setups have quite done it much justice. All I can say is nothing I've heard does vocals (especially female vocals) as well as the HiFiMAN planar series. Anything from Norah Jones' heartwarming, angelic voice to Paco de Lucias lightning quick flamenco guitar is simply breathtaking.
3. Tech House/Minimal - Nothing brings out the clean, fast bass like a bit of minimal or tech-house. It's not just the bass line that's in focus here though - vocals and ambients are really transparent and present without any separation issues with the deep, thumping bass-lines.

Thanks for the nice review. I guess I may be in some disagreement here. Sorry if this is a bit off topic. Even though I haven't tried HE-400, I own the bigger brother HE-500 and also DT990 Pro 250 Ohm and used to have stock D2000. I I find my DT990 Pro has better separation and better imaging ability than my HE-500 out of my HM-601 headphone out as well as Fiio E11 via HM-601 line out. I suppose HE-500 is underpowered with this setup because I do find DT990 preferable to HE-500 with this source in many cases. I also found the bass quality of the stock D2000, while very good, to be somewhat lacking compared to DT990 pro low end, again out of the HM-601 and Fiio E11. In particular, I found D2000 somewhat boomy in the bass and while it was able to reach very deep, it lacked authority. The DT990, on the other hand, has a very well controlled low end that is almost as well extended as D2000, but also tighter, faster and more textured. Overall, I find DT990 technically superior to stock D2000 in almost all aspects including speed, clarity, imaging and resolution. The pro DT990 may be different sounding from DT990 premium, but from what I read the differences are minimal.
 
HE-400 is a step down from HE-500, but I suppose it is also easier to drive and may sound better than HE-500 out of low end sources. However, it seems to me that well designed dynamics are not necessarily inferior to well designed planars, at least that is my experience when comparing DT990 pro and HE-500. Just different strokes for different folks. Orthos tend to have a smoother, more laid back sound that is easier on the ears, are faster and also tend to have better clarity than dynamics, but a well designed, open back dynamic driver can come very close to a good Ortho in technical ability while also providing a different flavor to the sound with a more aggressive presentation that some, including myself, may prefer IMO.

I don't really know.  I've tried my best to like the HD650 and DT990, but ultimately they both ended up falling short for me.  Transient wise, I think both are very good, and DT990's soundstaging is best I've ever heard aside from HD800.  I really can't agree on the DT990's bass extension though.  It has a decently impactful mid-bass, but its sub-bass isn't that powerful at all, nothing in comparison to a Denon.  HE-400 and I assume other planar magnetics are the closest thing any open can will get to a Denon sub-bass.
 
The soundstaging of the DT990 is about the only thing I miss.
 
You're not the first person to say the DT990's sub-bass was very impactful and that it was majority sub-bass compared to mid-bass, while others even went as far as to say the Denons were majority mid-bass.  I'm not sure if it's differnece in amp/sources or just differences in the way people listen to music.

Seriously, what are you doing with your headband that it's digging into your cranium?  Of all the potential points of discomfort I can think of on the HFM designs, the headband is not really one of them.  Actually the worst headband feel I've ever had was the K702 for the first week or two until the flat, stiff leather broke in and curved to my head.  Second worst was HD650 when I didn't have the band adjusted long enough and it crushed into my head.  Short of that, the weight of the headphones isn't really even on the headband.  Adjust the bloody headband wider (move the cups/struts down), stretch the band, and wear the band further toward the front of your head.  You shouldn't feel the headband! 
 
Now my ears, jawbone, cheekbone, and the squishy part at my temple....that can be painful at times.  However I'm sensitive enough that even the Denons get me sensitive to that.  And there's nothing more comfortable than them (oh, yes, I took your advice and talked to Malveaux and got some D5000's to complement the HE-400.   Very nice complement.  I still like HE-400 better, but they're VERY different and do vocals and sub-bass oh so well!) )   The Denons should also teach you how you're supposed to position headbands.  The Denon logo should be level, and the band is at a sharp angle...that's generally where any headphone's band should probably be on your head.  Try to achieve that same angle with HE-400 and see how you go.  Due to the weight of HE-400, putting it a little farther back than that may not be a bad idea.
 
The headband withstands some serious punishment.  Don't try to "bend and mold" the headband, just apply some even force to the top arch, the sides of the top arch, and if the cups clamp to much try to pry the areas near where the cups attach wider.  You won't succeed very well.   Also try leaving them stretched over a wide object, very stretched for an hour or two.   A few days of that and they'll loosen up nicely.  I don't want mine stretched any more than they are now. The idea is more about lessening the increasing, very slightly, the radii of the arch and the end tapers, and generally softening the steel a bit so it has less spring tension. 
 
Unless you have a pointy head.  Then grab a hammer and smack the center from the inside

Oh the padding is quite thin, it's sort of a memory foam.  But the headband should never have enough weight on it to actually matter at all, the weight sound be supported by the (softened) clamp on the ears, and only somewhat shared with the band.  
 
Of my two pairs one came with a very strongly clamping headband.  The other came with an EXTREMELY flexible, extremely loose headband.  You'd like that latter one.  The stronger one did better after abusing gently massaging the headband.  But on neither was the headband a source of discomfort as the earpads still take up most of the weight.  UNLESS you're putting the thing on the crown of your head.  That I will confirm hurts.  But it shouldn't be that far back.  If you have that much pressure I'm guessing you need to set the band adjustment to a larger height and move it forward on your head.  If the band is too tight (on any headphone) you'll feel the band a LOT more.  (I don't mean stretching it with that, I mean just the adjustable cup height.)
 
 
As for abusing the band....I agree caution is wise, but stretching it out over a large object, even if you don't want to actually bend it (note you can't actually bend it, it's just stretching the arch a bit, and even that takes a lot of effort.) and leaving it there shouldn't harm it.  It's like putting it on a football player's head for a while  
 
Even when you stretch it, and just flex it a bit, it tends to want to reform its old shape again, but after it's sufficiently loosened it relaxes more easily if you just stretch them wider than your head before putting them on your head. 
 
ordinarily I wouldn't want to work the metal of a headband either, but I simply couldn't have worn them the other way, and the result is quite nice.  I still fidget with them, but again, I fidget with the Denons too, it's just me.

I feel that DT990 has a more 3D soundstage than HE-500 - it sounds more like live music while HE-500 sounds more like a recording in this regard. I am sure the HE-500 will outclass DT990 in realism with binaural recordings. But with regular stereo, I prefer DT990 soundstage. I don't think DT990 is better than HE-500 across the spectrum. Sub bass is clearly superior on HE-500 and the overall sound is definitely more neutral and accurate. HE-500 also has faster transients in the lows and sounds quick and snappy, whereas DT990 bass can get a tad slow and boomy at times. HE-500 has superior clarity, but DT990 is sufficiently clear already. DT990 does separate sounds more, whereas HE-500 sounds more integrated and perhaps more coherent. In other aspects, the two are on about the same playing field out of HM-601 and Fiio E11. Resolution is similar, dynamics are similar, timbre is really good on both, although different - HE-500 sounds more realistic, while DT990 sounds darker and more seductive, but still quite natural. I find DT990 needs a dedicated amp to sound full. Straight out of HM-601, it can be somewhat thin and harsh, but with Fiio E11 it is significantly fuller and richer sounding.
 
I assume you have the stock D2000. I found that while it sounds wonderfully dynamic, clear and neutral for a closed headphone, the closed headphone sound is still there. In particular, I found D2000 to have a noticeable grain to its sound, especially in the treble. It wasn't really harsh, but sounded a tad metallic and lacking delicacy which is a typical issue with dynamic driver closed headphones. I also found imaging rather poor on D2000. Soundstage was impressively wide and quite deep, but sounds were all over the place. DT990 has a blacker background with the edges of sounds more clearly defined. I also find DT990 more resolving and more natural. D2000 has a bit of a veil to it and sounds a bit plasticy. But to each their own of course. I felt that D2000 needs modification to compete with open cans of DT990/HD650/K701 level.

Considering that I have the HE-5LEs, the HE-400s and the TP50RPs (modded), but not the HE-500s, I will say that if you were to make the HifiMAN jump, the HE-500 will require a bit more juice than the Fostex, even after the modifications.  Believe me, I love my Fostex dearly - I go to sleep with them on each night.  However, when I want to really get into my music at the detailed aspect, the HifiMAN products ring through.  The HE-400s is fairly efficient and probably no harder to drive than a pair of modified Fostex T50RPs.  Then again, the cost is about $275.00 more for the HE-400s over a $125.00 pair of modified Fostex headphones.  
 
If you had a local headphone audio meet, that would be your best bet to be able to try some of the headphones out.  It would certainly be cheaper than buying, paying for shipping and then having to pay to ship the item back if it didn't suit your likes.  To me ears, though, there is enough of an audio improvement in what the HE-400 offers to justify the $275.00 difference in price.  By this, I mean nothing negative towards the Fostex either.  However, the HifiMAN headphones offer a real different dimension in presentation.  Plus, there's a lot of other headphones that fall in between the price of a $125.00 pair of modified Fostex and the $399 pair of HifiMAN HE-400s.  Going through the weeding out process would be a bit painful, I would think.
 
Edit: One thing to keep in mind.  Since the Fostex is fairly a closed headphone (depending on the number of bass vents left open), it will not bother others around you when you listen.  Meanwhile, the HifiMAN is wide open.  Others around you will easily hear what you're listening to.  When I had my HifiMAN headphones on at a very moderate level, my wife asked me why I was listening to them so loudly.  I exclaimed that I wasn't and the volume level was quite normal.  She then couldn't understand why someone would buy a headphone if it didn't offer one privacy in listening.  I couldn't give her the whole speech about a more open sound stage, etc. so I just let that conversation quickly die.

Yeah, be careful with those new Denons, they may qualify for the most hideous headphones I've ever seen.  Of course, we don't know yet how they sound....
 

 
Rumor mill in the "D7100" thread says the design was done by a US company....no word on who though.   It's nasty looking though if those are the final product.
 
 

 
That catalog is a Foster catalog, but the similarity to certain old Denon units in there does make me wonder if, at least in the JPN market if Forster will be selling the old Denon models under their own name now?
 
The new Denons...the ~$500 pair looks stylistically almost identical to Beats, and the ~$1200 pair simply defies any and all explanation.  I'm not sure what they're trying to accomplish, or who's designing the sound, but I think we'll have to wait for results to see who they're targeting and if the sound is really up to expectations. 
 
It's a really weird turn for such an "mainstream up-scale" company.

Finally, someone who agrees with me that HD800 is hideous! 
 
I agree and all bets are off until the listening tests.  But the difference there is Senn is a speaker/mic company, overpriced or not, who is famed for no-compromises audio performance in a given price range, and a good history of pleasing picky audiophiles.  Denon is an excellent amp & component company with a good history of pleasing picky stereophiles with a budget who happens to badge a line of headphones too.  It's like buying headphones "made" by Jack Wu 
 
Denon contracted unknown-company-X to design a headphone that first and foremost seems designed by focus groups to visually appeal to the iPod demographic, and seems to display the prototypes proudly in front of pictures of iPhones.  That can't be a good sign for a $1300 headphone.  At that price it had better darned well compete with T1, LCD-2, and even HD800.  Or at least D7k.   It is entirely possible though they tried to eat their cake and have it too: design a headphone that looks flashy like Beats to sell to the iDevice crowd, and sounds refined like D7k to sell to the audiophile crowd.  It's possible.

I commented in TMRaven's thread before a little on the two, and I've only had my D5ks for a few days so far, but I think they're extremely different headphones.   I think, if I had to pick just one, I'd pick the HE-400, I think they're slightly more versatile and easier to listen to.   But the Denons make for a very different presentation.   Although the Denons have bass extension like no other, I'd consider them a fairly bright headphone.  The comparison I used in the other thread is that it's bright in a warm wooden way like a nice guitar or violin with a bright sound.  It's not K702 or HD800 bright, but it's a warm-bright but with deep, flat bass extension and a fair bit of sparkle in the treble, and somewhat forward mids without being aggressive in the Grado sense.
 
By contrast, HE-400 is dark or dark-neutral with a sort of syrupy texture (if that makes any sense.)  It's balanced across, kind to the ears, and just smooth (by smooth I don't mean "smoothed over" or lacking detail, just smooth in the presentation.    HE-400 has weight (not bass bloat, just weight to the sound.)  D5k is a bit more light despite the deep bass.  It picks up a lot of the wood sound you'd expect wood to provide which makes it kind of organic for recordings that are warm or bright.  The HE-400 gives that lushness and that open air and reverberation for recordings that you'd expect to be played in a large space. 
 
Both are lively, in contrast to HD650 or presumably HE-500 which should be more laid back.  Neither is fatiguing compared to K702, though the Denons are a bit more tiring over time than the HE-400.
 
They're both very different, but I like them almost equally.   Certain recordings would do very well with the Denons (or for that matter, AT W-series closed wood cans.)

That's a difficult question because it depends on what you're looking for.  Do I think the D5k is an excellent headphone and an excellent compliment to HE-400?  Certainly!  Does it bug me that they don't have detachable cables?  Somewhat (but I know for a price I could ship them to someone to replace the cable.)  Is it the only headphone that would compliment HE-400?  By all means, no! 
 
It depends what you're looking for in a compliment.  D5k offers the semi-closed sound with the ultra-low bass and semi-isolation.  It has a somewhat bright presentation, at least compared to HE-400 and HD650.  It has a lot of treble sparkle to it, in the Beyer sense of the word.  That compliments the very open, dark HE-400s.
 
I also have HD650 (well it's out of commission at the moment, but a little necromancy, and it'll be as good as new!)  They also compliment HE-400.  Both are dark, but HD650 has that relaxing, polite, mids-centric sound which is very different from HE-400.  While D5k offers almost more energy than HE-400 and more attack in all directions, which is different, HD650 is the other opposite, something with less energy and a more relaxed, vibe.  Equally different. 
 
I also have K702.   In some ways this is the most starkly different at all.  It has an almost ruler-flat, cold, dry, airy, analytical sound.  While the HE-400 is warm and alive, but lets a few pieces of the spectrum dip a bit out of range, the K702 will show EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE along the spectrum in equal detail and clarity.   K702 can get fatiguing but it's a very unique sound signature that one either loves or hates and is never in between on.  Because of its analytical nature, it's not always the most pleasing to listen to, but it's almost a must for every audiophile's collection (unless you have T1, T5p, HD800, Etymotic IEMs, or any other uber-resolving headphone.) as a flat reference to what you're hearing. 
 
K702 and HD650 need relatively serious power to shine, but then again, so does HE-400, so any amp upgrade for one helps all three.
 
So is it a good compliment?  Yes.  Of all possible compliments, is it the right one for you?  You'll need to identify what you're looking for in a complimentary headphone first.
 
 

 
I think it depends on your listening genres as to which sound signature you'd prefer, plus preference.  The Denons are really semi-closed.  They don't fully isolate outside sound, and they don't fully seal in inside sound.  There's still leakage depending on listening volume, so for library type environments, you still could make some enemies.  On the other hand, the HFM planars are the most undamped open "earspeaker' I've heard.  They're nearly as loud outside as they are inside, and thus leak more sound than either HD650 or K702 by a notable amount.  It's really like putting little speakers up to your ears at low volume.  If you don't listen loud, it's not a problem, but if you do, you definitely don't want to bother others with them!  But you could always compromise and go with a dynamic open back too  which leaks less outside than HiFiMans but more than Denons.

Okay, for what it's worth I wanted to post a my impression of a cable swap with the he400. I bought the cable here on the used forum and it was made by Chris_himself. Sorry Chris, I got nothing but love for ya bro'. I want to say that if you are considering an after market cable, Chris makes really really nice stuff at a very reasonable price (shameless plug). 
 
The cable itself:
 
The first thing that you notice is the size and weight difference between the pure silver over the stock. The silver cables is absolutely feather light. The stock cable seems like a hose pipe compared to it. You don't feel any weight from the cable at all. In a blind test I would not be able to tell if the silver cable or no cable was connected. It's that light. It's finished in a nice double helix 1/4 plug for termination with a nice wooden yoke. The silver cable is also only 74" which means I don't have to run the cable around the back of my desk which I also appreciate. It's the perfect length to run to my amp with about 2 foot to spare for excess. The look is just awesome. 
 
Initial sound Impression:
 
This is what you'll want to know, right? The silver cable produces a very different sound. It's airy and detailed. Very revealing. I have the velour pads installed currently. The combination of the velours and silver cable reminds me alot of the he500. Don't have them anymore. Compared to the stock cable, the stock has more weight to the sound. Certainly there is more bass extension and impact. I've only had about an hour worth of head time so far after the cable change. Classical is just superb with the silver cable. Pop and rock may be somewhat bass light. Give me a few hours to really audition  and I'll post back if anyone is interested.

I haven't really fully bought into the whole cable debate but I will admit that I am not a fan of the stock HE500 cable. It sounds fantastic but I got one terminated with 1/8" and a crappy 1/4" adapter and just don't like it so I took the plunge and preordered the Norse Norn V2, I figured while I was at it I'd future proof it and ordered it terminated in a mini xlr (male) and bought a 2 foot adapter (mini xlr female to 1/4") that way if I move to a balanced amp I can just buy another adapter to balanced termination. I don't honestly know if it sounds better but I know it is absolutely bloody beautiful and is a cable worthy of a high end headphone. The cotton, the braiding, the wood splitter it all just screams artisan craftsmanship and I can't get over how much I love it. If pressed I would say I've noticed a more lush sound if anything but my HE500 really makes me a happy camper. 
 
That being said if anyone really wants to try the silver cable on their HE400 I'll let it go for 25 bucks plus shipping (I'll just buy a record...) and you can check it out yourself....

The magnet is stronger but I don't know that the diaphragm or coil is different, though I don't know that they're the same either, TBH.  Tyll claims to hear a slight difference between them but they measured very similarly so it could be expectation bias.  If it has the same diaphragm the stronger magnet is kinda pointless, from my understanding the point to making a stronger magnet is to use fewer windings or thinner wire to make the bobbin as light as possible.  I'm pretty sure that D5K has the same wire as the 7K, the 7K just has a thicker jacket, though when you're talking about the difference between the conductors themselves, there are only a few nines on the tail end of a decimal point that differentiate the two.  
 
Tyll's new measurements seems to show the D7000 as slightly lower impedance than the D5000 which could be caused by fewer windings but it could also be caused by manufacturing variance.

Uhh, bright? What would it take for him to consider a headphone dark?  Even neutral?  Compared to HE-400, HD650 is a treble-head's dream.  They have plenty of balanced treble to spare, but there's nothing bright about HE-400.  Are you sure Fang didn't paint some HE-6's blue or something? 
 
 

 
HE-400 may have a slight u-shape, but not enough of one for me to call it  a "u" or "v" shape, really.  It's pretty flat, with specific spikes/dips along the way.  HE-400 has no shortage of treble detail, but assuming your D2k's have similar treble to my D5ks (and I have no reason not to believe so), I wouldn't call HE-400 anywhere in range of the treble energy of Denons which are pretty extreme.  D2k supposedly does have that u-shape going, which probably keeps them from feeling overly bright, but D5k with the bumped mids, I'd say in the absence of that famous deep bass, would be widely regarded as an honest-to-goodness bright headphone. 
 
On the Objective 2 the Denons are bright, very sparkly, while their raw UHF extension isn't as severe as K702, I'd say their brightness, overall, exceeds that of K702.  The only thing that saves it is the warmed over timbre of the sparkle versus the usual "cold sparkle" associated with bright headphones.  On the same O2, the HE-400 brightens up considerably, and arguably I could agree with Tyll in that they no longer sound "dark", but to call them bright, especially when placed next to Denons is a stretch! 
 
HE-400 reacts remarkably differently on a neutral SS amp versus a hybrid/tube amp.  They get brighter, more detailed, from a measurement perspective, probably "superior" on an SS, and the SS brings out their pure technical ability that I didn't realize existed, but I think, personally, they sound better in their "dark mode" when given some tube warmth.  It makes me wonder what Tyll was driving it with.  Right out of a DAP or something I could see it sounding bright.  Despite the impedance I think they still need serious voltage swing for the low end to come out.

At least with the pleather, I never get a sense of a true spike.  Very nice, refined, detailed, articulate treble, but I don't get a sense of that spike, and I really must insist that the Denons (maybe D5k does have sharper treble than 2k?) are by far brighter, almost in the Beyer sense.  But yes, there's no question, once you've heard Beyer, nothing else short of Grado or HD800 will ever seem bright again   HE-400 is simply not bright, in any way.  To call HE-400 bright would be to call HD650 and K702 "Beyer's new lineup" 
 

 
While they're relatively inefficient by headphone standards, they're efficient for ortho standards.  Virtually anything will drive them.  I won't deny that Lyr's my favorite, but my O2 drives them very well, in a different direction.  Even little E11's will drive them, though not as wonderfully as a higher end amp.
 
LDMKII is nice, but as an OTL, it may not be the best match for low impedance headphones.  It'll probably work, but I can't say how pleasing you'll find the output.  Generally OTL amps do better with higher impedance cans and can't generate the somewhat higher current required by low impedance cans.  But since HE-400 is more sensitive than other orhos, you still have a chance of it coming out ok!

The most important part is what makes YOU happy with your listening experience.  A $200 cable can mean very different things to different people.  Some might not place as high of a value on having such a cable.  Yet, there will be others who may have more disposable income and think very little of the expense, yet enjoy what the cable brings to the cable.
 
I do have experience with Canare and the Mogami Quad Neglex.  The Mogami is a bit more than twice the cost (per linear foot), yet I do believe it is a slightly better sounding cable.  It was pretty much the norm on the last 2 or 3 Grado / Magnum modifications that I had performed.  I think as time goes by, I'll get another order in for some cable to make better 4-pin extension cables for my HifiMANs that I'm running off the speaker taps.  This will also include a new cable that leads to the golden connectors on the cups, too.

My income not allowing me to spend $200 on cable just to show others i have one but once i got one i notice improvement in bass depth plus treble became refined
As i said before ON MY SETUP without external amp D5000/7000 more neutral and balanced for me than HE-400 plus light and comfortable. At the  same time HE-400 live well with recordings whose level is too high while on D5000 they are distorted. D7000 almost fix that problem but have only 95% of bass depth comparing to D5000 so i chose to keep D7000 to best overall sound. Plus i prefer pleather pads on HE-400 for bass but they less comfortable for me since i'm wearing glasses. I borrowed and tried E11 but didn't notice any improvement on HE-400 while noticed some bass improvement on HD650 but still not on par with HE-400 / D5000/7000 so i'm planning to sell HD650

Interesting you went with blue.  What improvements did you notice from it?   I was considering a silver for a while, but after hearing O2 brighten up HE-400 (and disliking the result) I'm thinking blue/black may be preferable.  Did you try black or silver at all, or only the blue?
 

 
My feeling on cables (beyond the fact that pre-made after-market cables are grossly overpriced for what you get, it is unfortunately the norm) is that compared to headphone, amp and DAC changes, a cable has marginal ability to change anything.  However, once you've settled on end-game source/amp and don't intend to upgrade it, cables, like tubes, can be used to slightly tweak/refine your sound where you want it to be.  Cost-to-performance they're miserable value, but  I do believe they can add the finishing touch to round out little issues with equipment you've already decided you like enough to stick with.
 
Other than maybe buying LCD-2 someday, I'm pretty much at end-game with HE-500/D5k/Lyr/Bifrost/O2.  I don't intend to upgrade the DAC or the amps (though I could add a "desktop O2' when available, not for improvement in sound but in connection options and fit & finish) and LCD-2 is the only remaining headphone I have much of any interest in at all unless I feel the desire to pick up T50's for playing with mods.  So on that front, tweaking via cables and tubes is a nice way to alter what I already like by slight margins.  And that's the only position I find them terribly worth recommending. 
 

 
Dragon in general, or what you thought olegausany bought?  For the dragons, blue & black Dragon are copper, Silver Dragon is silver.  Black supposedly has thicker gauge conductors as the main difference.
 

 
E11 isn't an excellent amp for HD650 which craves high voltage, or for that matter HE-400 or D5000 either, though I liked it better for HD650 than my Headroom Micro.  But HD650, and I think HE-400 really opens up on a hybrid amp.   D5000 I like with a nice SS amp though.  E11 isn't terrible for what it is, but I have all three headphones you mention (D5k not D7k) and E11 doesn't bring out the best in any of them the way Lyr or O2 does. Lyr (and most hybrids I'd guess) is pretty incredible with HE-400 and HD650.
 
But I'd love to know your Dragon impressions and comparisons, since I'm considering one!

Blue Dragon IS "a high purity copper conductor using the Ohno Continuous Casting Process. It has the same geometry structure as the Silver Dragon Version 3 only it uses UP-OCC pure copper"
Black Dragon IS "a 4 x 21.5AWG Teflon insulated stranded conductors using pure single crystallized UP-OCC pure copper with 7N purity 99.99998%."
Silver Dragon IS "4 x 99.99998% UP-OCC Stranded Silver 24AWG Teflon insulated stranded conductors"
I never heard Black or Silver Dragon but read a review (can't remember where since it all happened more than a year ago) where reviewer  had all three cables and tried them with HD650, HD800 and some other headphones and said at the end that he prefers Blue Dragon for HD650 so when someone posted in for sale forum that he selling barely used (about 30 hours) Blue Dragon cable 30% cheaper than directly from Moon Audio i immediatelly pulled the trigger and never regret it.I'm also thinking about recabling my D7000 but didn't find yet any comparison between stock, Lawton Audio or any other cable.
As i already said in previous post i have NO external AMP so my experience is different but as soon as i connected it i noticed some improvement in bass depth and about after extra 20 hours i noticed that treble distortin i had on some recordings was gone plus overall sound over entire frequency range was smooth and refined so i'm considering to contact Drew and ask if they deal with Denons.

I've got the Black Dragon on my HD650's and really enjoy it. It opened them up a bit across the range but they've ben on for so long that I really don't remember what the stock cable was like.  I did have the HD25's with the Silver Dragon IEM v1 and it was really nice.  Tried the silver on the HD650's and it was awful. Lost all bass impact and sounded very hollow.
For the HE-400, I wanted to go a different route and went with the Q cable.  This cable is so light you don't even know it's there.  I really disliked the feel of the stock HE-400 cable.  Again, it opened the HE-400 up across the range and made the sound fuller.  Just my opinion.  Is it worth the $$, probably not.  If I were to do it again, I'd probably go Toxic for half the price.  All in all, I'm pleased with the cables but its a lot of bucks for a bit of improvement.
I'm liking what I've bee reading about the Lyr in driving both the HD650 & HE400. That will probably be my next purchase.
BTW.. between this thread (thanks for the great review Matt!) and hearing the LCD-2, I decided to sell off my HD25 & Silver Dragon to get the HE400. No looking back, I love the HE400.
Edit: just ordered the velour pads.. looking forwards to trying them.

Thanks for the info on your experience with cables....you may have set my HD650 decision to Black instead of Silver (once I get my replacement drivers...)   That sounds more the direction I'm looking for (I'm uncertain that I'd ever like silver on any headphone....)  Nor do I want my HD650s to stop being HD650s by turning them into Beyers 
 
I'd probably stick with Dragon for the HE400s.  I am astounded at the Q Cables pricing, and dislike a little of their snaky rhetoric.   Not that ALL cable vendors aren't selling some level of snake oil, but at least with Moon, there's pretty much a "here it is, take it or leave it" approach rather than endless self promotion and shaky pseuo-science justifications!  But honestly, despite disliking the feel, to me the HE-400 sounds great just as they are, I'd be almost afraid of ruining the magic with either velour or a new cable!
 
HE-400 is indeed pretty special.  LCD-2 is the only other headphone at this point that really interests me.  I get tempted by the "perfection" that is HD800, but I think the treble would drive me off the deep end.  The weight of LCD-2 concerns me, and the $1k pricetag ($1500 for HD800?  Sheesh), is frightening compared to a collection of different cans with different sounds.  I'm not sure I could get myself to pay full price for them considering every time I listen to HE-400 on Lyr I always think to myself "what could LCD-2 do for music that this can't do?" Despite the lectures of "headphone x is superior"  that mentality always holds for me until I put them back on my head, and then I'm still left wondering what exactly "better" means.  There are no issues I wish to correct, other than maybe weight or soundstage.  And LCD2 won't help the first and will marginally help the second.  It's all too easy to get sucked into "this headphone is technologically superior so I want it."  I won't dispute Audeze's build superiority though.   And the HiFiMan soundstage could be EASILY fixed with some deep angled cups if they ever make them.
 
Be sure to report back on your experience with velour.   And also how easy/difficult it is to install them. I still can't get a feel for how to go about a pad change.  I'm still not sure I'd change...the pleather is so darn comfy!
 
By the way, your comment earlier about having heard the LCD2 and finding that they're far better and worth that price, once you're up to the $1k level (plus HE-400 and HE-500), it's all subjective.  There are people that prefer HE-500 to LCD-2, most consider them equals.  There are some, thus that prefer HE-400 to HE-500 for the sound signature, such as Matt (though it sounds like that opinion may be changing?)   So if a $700 can is equal to the 1k can, some prefer it more, and some prefer the $400 can to the $700 can, is the LCD-2 really worth $600 more? Probably not.  If they were all the same price, the opinions would probably be evenly split, or maybe only a slightly smaller portion picking 400.  I still stand by the opinion that HE-400 is a hard to categorize because it costs less than HD650, but has more in common with HE-500 & LCD-2 than it does with HD650 in terms of performance.  It's what the HD700 should have been, for less money.  The only thing that keeps HD650 in the game at those prices  is that its sound signature is entirely unique and you can't get get it anywhere else.

You're right, I was looking at the pricing for stereo interconnects (in pairs) that were $300 for 3ft!    For $100 a foot, that stuff better make breakfast.
 
I agree about the stock HE400 cable....it's balanced mic cable so I imagine it's about as accurate as you can get.   On the other hand my opinion of cables is that, it's not that a better cable delivers more sound for more money, it's that an inferior cable delivers more sound for more money.  Dead-perfect cable is dirt-cheap and can be sourced anywhere (Belden, Canare, etc. (In fact many exotic cables use Belden cables inside).  I think what we're buying with "designer" cables is very specific flaws that interfere with the music in ways we find desirable, much like how tubes interfere with music in ways we find desirable.   Connectors, solders, configurations/gauges that add/reduce capacitance, resistance, impedance (at the connectors) etc in ways that is technically less perfect than the cheap stuff, and thus does things we may like to the signal.  That's my take on copper vs. copper.  Silver's a whole different thing.  We audiophiles are an odd bunch: "You mean it's a piece of copper that's so badly oxidized that it distorts all frequencies above 5khz?  I'll give you $1k for it!, it should pair well with my leftover 1930's technology transistors that massacre everything from 10Hz to 800Hz that I paid $400 for!"   On paper it all sounds so backwards until you actually listen to it 
 
The pads are cheap enough to try so long as their easy to change and so long as changing them doesn't loosen the already loose tolerances of the pads and how they sit on the frame.  But I suspect trying them will be one of those "maybe I like this better, maybe I don't" things I'd end up debating forever, so it's probably best I don't keep them around.  There's a lot the pleather's do right in terms of feel and sound!  They were sold, originally, as an upgrade to the velour after all...

Yes, Head Direct customer service is nice - very pleasant, actually.  However, where the need for concern comes in is if you experience the issue again and decide to have yours swapped out, you'll have to keep in mind some of the turn-around times that have been posted here, as well as mine.  It's the turn-around time component of customer service that needs to be improved upon.
 
In other news ... and, slightly off-topic as far as HifiMAN goes.  I've been searching for a pair of headphones to tweak, play with, experience another sound signature, etc.  About a month back, I went through the horrific process of ordering the Brainwavz HM5 headphones which proved to be hollow-sounding and really not worth the cost, but they did include some great accessories.  However, this morning, I received a Best Buy coupon for 20% off any mobile phone accessory as a follow-up to my mobile phone purchase from them - even though I never have purchased a mobile phone from them.  Well, at lunch time, I ran over to the store with the coupon and picked up the Philips "Uptown" headphones.  With the coupon, it was only $119 + tax for the pair.  I'm finishing up my work day and don't have my regular music player at work, but just the ol' Dell and the AC97 audio.  But, with Foobar and WASAPI installed, along with a few free various .MP3 files downloaded from Amazon at lower bit rates to play around with.  I'm finding out these headphones have a very balanced sound to them and can't wait until later to test them further from home.
 
While in the store, I tried the Klipsch, the Philips O'Neil (from last year), the Rocketfish noise-canceling headphone with Wolfson technology and the Uptowns.  The Klipsch Image One was also going to be on my targeted list, but the Uptowns really had the edge over on them - or, at least with the demo box that they were connected to.  These headphones have only been in the market for a few weeks now, but I'm sure we'll see some reviews coming along soon.  Tyll had just received the Downtowns a few weeks back, so he reviewed those.  The Downtowns were also set up on the listening station, but the Uptowns simply sounded better.  I'm not sure exactly which headphone I'd take to pit against the Uptowns, but suspect something possibly like the Grado HF-2 for a side-by-side sound comparison.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is that finally we're getting some great sounds from more portable cans, along with being closed off for privacy and travel that sound pretty awesome.

Wow.  I'm really hoping for the best in your situation.  In Hong Kong, I dealt with Quingting.  He was great to communicate with and really stood on top of things where he could.  However,  you also have to factor in the 12 hour time difference.  In fact, I'd wake up at about 4:00 a.m. (Eastern time) to catch his e-mail messages so I could respond accordingly.  When you send your headphones into NY, call them on the day of, or the day after they are expected to be received and ensure Mrs. T. has them in posession.  In my case, I used Priority Mail and she indicated she had to go "pick them up".  So, I'm not sure if she's even located at the address where the shipments of defective items arrive.  However, when I called hear and learned that she was headed over to the location, it was actually on the afternoon of the day after the shipment had arrived in NY containing my package.
 
A bit later tonight, I'll PM you some e-mail addresses.  Having them will allow you to stay on top of things and ensure a timely turn-around.  Frankly, it would just be ideal if they would charge your credit card and send a pair out ASAP.  Then, when your bad headphones are received, issue the credit.  This would cut two weeks off of their current process - I'm quite sure of that.

After getting a bit of insomnia at 4:00 a.m. this morning, I applied a top coat of polyurethane in my dining room and then moved on to trying the velour pads that came with my HE-5LEs.  Keeping in mind, I was about half awake at the time, I put on Kid Rock's "Born Free" to have a listen with the velour pads.  Clearly, the sound stage improved by many points.  Yet, on that particular album, I was finding that the recording alone was a bit bright and possibly not the best for trying out the velour pads.  I then realized, I missed some of the "warmth" that the protein leather pads provided on the HE-400s.  I then compared the pad thickness.  The protein leather pads were ever-so-slightly thicker than the velour pads, which meant for my fit and wearing, they would allow for slightly less clamping force than the other pads.
 
However, I'm not giving up just yet.  I'd still like to try my velour pads with some of the other genres that I listen to for the most part, as well as do the listening under more coherent situations for myself.

I think your comments are in line with what a lot of other people are stating.  When the HE-400 (rev. 1) was launched and the orders from the pre-order were shipped, they included a cable with a 1/4" termination on them.  I have one of these cables and feel that it is a better choice as many people have 1/4" terminations in the amps and where they use their headphones.  Yet, there is still the 3.5mm crowd - those who use amplifiers that might be smaller in design and have 3.5mm outputs, those who are using the HE-400s with a portable music device and no amplifier, which also has a 3.5mm output.  It looks like HifiMAN might have been deciding on supplying a cable for their primary core user of what they believed for the HE-400s.  For me, personally, I love the dongles from Grado that are about 6" long and allow one to convert from a 1/4" plug to a 3.5" plug.  It is really a great way to go and opt for a solid converter.
 
Then again, in your case,  you could always purchase a Neutrik, or Furutech 1/4" termination and have it soldered on after you've cut off the existing, molded 3.5mm jack.

Chris,
 
It appears your thought pattern is in line with what many others are finding.  Some are liking the better bass output (more of it) vs. the "5" series from HifiMAN.  However, I've been using the HE-400s a lot lately and should move to the HE-5LE for a bit and get the most of it.  And, yes, you can hang in the HE-400 tread - that's where the action is at the moment.
 
Actually, I did stir up the crowd in the Brainwavz HM5 thread the other evening after purchasing the Philips "Uptown" headphones.  I was basically trying to state that there were better options in the $140 - $150 league than the HM5 headphones.  Needless to say, many hopped in to defend the HM5 - even those who didn't even receive their HM5s that were on order, were hopping in.  But, I've found that I can transition quite easily from the HE-400 / HE-5LE during the day to the "Uptown" at night for winding down to sleep.  The "Uptown" provides just the right amount of bass, mids and highs that I love and makes my music sound great off the portable player and portable amp.

=============================================


Why is it I can check this thread for hours with no updates, and when I come back there's two pages of threads, half of which I want to reply to? 
 

 
I'm never sure how to take estimations like that.   They contradicted their own "650 > 400" statement in a reply in the threads, however the scalability of HD650 is legendary so there's little reason to doubt it.  I agree, I've been spending more time with HE400 (well, I bought HE-400 as a "replacement/upgrade" for my broken HD650s.   Now that my HD650's are back as of last night, (Yaaay!  I missed those things! ) I can do a more immediate comparison.   I've been using HE-400 mostly for the past month or so, and some D5k usage in the past week or two.  Switching back to HD650 made me immediately think "where'd my bass go?"  It felt hollow at the low end in the same way the HE-400 felt bloated at the low end first switching from 650 & K702.  But just like the HE-400 I quickly adapted and appreciated the HD650's real virtues again. 
 
My thoughts of the comparison are that they're almost impossible to compare because the sound signatures are almost polar opposites.  Comparison of "this has more treble detail or that has more bass" is irrelevant, the very point of HD650 is to roll off both and focus on the mids and it remains, almost, the undisputed champ at doing so.  Not may others try that sound signature.  HE-400 is a bit more balanced from tip to stern, and definitely more lively.   On sheer technical achievement I'd have to conclude that HE-400 may be the superior one.  HD650 is clearly the more neutral and natural though and has that amazing timbre and refined "reference" sound that is hard to qualify.  HE-400 better separates each instrument, but HD650 better integrates the music into the whole.  They're so completely different, I don't know how anyone can objectively compare them, or even pretend to.   They only thing they have in common is detailed mids and a somewhat dark tone (but HE-400 is much darker.)  HD650 >>>> HE-400 in terms of comfort though 
 
Since I tend to listen to my music in a more active way, focusing on individual instruments (both for live performance and in speakers), and I somehow can't get enough of that syrupy dark timbre of HE-400 + pleather + hybrid-tubes, I think HE-400 has replaced HD650 as my go-to all rounder and is the only can that's managed to do so during the 5+ year's I've had HD650.   At the same time I really missed that relaxing, refined sound of HD650 and am thrilled to have it back in the stable.  Now I just need a quad or quint headphone stand! (Hey Chris....feel like making custom stands next?)    I love my more detailed and sparkly K702 and D5k, but HE-400 and HD650 are the two that I could listen to for hours on end and feel true reluctance of addiction when it comes time to put them down.
 


 
That mentality comes from the era of 5-10 years ago when the grand trio (HD650, K701/702, DT880 ) were the best money could buy (short of exotics like Stax & Orpheus.)  Anyone who was into hi-fi at the time remembers well that the only way to improve your sound beyond that was to upgrade the source chain, cables, etc.  The wars between the three camps are the stuff of legend, far more deeply embattled than the measly little disputes between LCD/HD800/T1 camps today.  But HD650 was the winner for the true high-end headphile, because it was the only one that could continue scaling into ever better ABX-proveable improvement straight up through the most exotic top of the line sources and amps.  The Summit-Fi forum was filled with talks of $10k stacks to feed HD650...Saumuels/Levinson/Spl amps, Benchmark and beyond DACs, Wadia SACDps, Audioquest Diamondback cables, all sorts of power cleaning equipment, you name it.  Indeed, the primitives of yesteryear lived in a different world....
 
In today's terminology, headphone upgrades can go far, but memories of that era are a constant reminder that neglecting source is also unwise.
 

 
It depends on perspective.  Sure, an LCD-2 would be a great upgrade depending on preference.  But remember that that source upgrade would have (depending on what you're upgrading from) a positive effect on all headphones, and would improve that LCD-2 as well!
 
If you gave my my choice, entirely for free, you'd pay for my headphones, of running any flagship on my old Headroom + EMU-0404, or of running HD650 (or HE-400) on the Lyr and Bifrost, I'd take the latter in a heartbeat.  No headphone no matter how great could give me the pleasure on the former seup that the latter provides.  And in terms of picking a source you personally prefer the sound of, that should also not be neglected.  By measurement my O2 is both cheaper and superior to the tube-distortion-iinduced Lyr.  The HE-400 looses a lot of their magic for me on the O2, while HE-400 on Lyr is addiction-inducing. 
 
There's more to building a listening system than superiority in driver performance.  Buying a $3k source is certainly overkill with what's available today unless you just have nowhere else to upgrade and really want to try upgrading.  But the idea of source matching (bot to your cans, and your brain) hasn't gone away.
 
I think there's a bit of a swing to the extremes, the same way the "measurements only" crowd insists on pinpoint measurements and misses the merits of cables, tubes, etc because they're trying so hard to combat snake-oil by measurements that they miss the original intent of euphonic changes.  I think people had gone so far to the extremes of buying exotic signal chains, that the anti-exotic advice started to take hold of "upgrade your headphones, not your sources."   It was sage advice in light of the trend at buying snake-oil but has now gone to the extreme of "ignore your source, buy garbage, and buy only great headphones", which is no better than buying garbage headphones and trying to "improve" them by running them on $3k amps.
 
At the end of the day what you're building is a system, not a headphone with something powering it.  The amp is the "motor" so to speak, and the output is only as good as what the combined system creates.  What produces the end sound is the overall system combined, not one specific component of that system.  That's one of the keys to Stax success.  They sell the entire system as a unit.   Headphones are the most dramatic change in the system, at least up to a certain level.  Beyond that, the source really does hold it back.  When I moved from EMU-0404 + Headroom Micro to Bifrost + Lyr, were it blind testing, I'd have easily believed that someone switched me to a different pair of headphones.  Much of it was personal preference as both systems were very good.  But it was a dramatic change toward a personal preference that works for me.
 
 

 
Hey, Chris! Unfortunately HE-400 is insufficient at slicing bread.  It is also less effective as a doorstop, counterbalance, or paperwight than either HE-400 or your LCD-2.  It won't snap your neck muscles, though, so that's nice!  It's also a heck of a lot easier to drive!  (Rated at 1W versus, what, 4W?)  
 
I actually haven't found any headphones that are good for slicing bread, however the exterior grill of open-back Audio Technica's makes for an ideal cheese grater!    (Anyone owning a pair of AT's is probably nodding in knowing agreement right now.... )
 

 
You meantioned some clamping force and headband fitting issues.  Is it possible that you had too much clamping force going on that was crushing the all too crushable pleathers farther than they should have been?  The bass response shouldn't be better with velour, not by a wide margin, unless the driver position didn't have enough breathing room with the pleather and was just being driven straight into the canal without having time to echo around the pad walls and attenuate the treble.  I noticed a much wider soundstage and improved overall detail after I stretched out my headband and got the pads to stop crushing flat. 
 
The more ridgid velours would prevent the pads from crushing as flat as the pleathers under the same headband clamping force.  What you're describing doesn't sound to me like velour vs pleather, but rather proper driver placement versus improper driver distance. 
 

 
As a counter-point, Chris is coming from LCD-2 which he seems to dislike, and HE-400 has been described as some as "LCD-2's little brother", primarily because both are some of the darkest cans around.  Though I think that name is a little bit misleading since only the low-end is dark on HE-400.   On the other hand he didn't like HE-500 much more, and that's brighter, so maybe HE-400's the charm?

Yeah, I wish it had a 1/4" jack.  Those are just so much nicer to work with.  The cheapie snap-on adapter is only a slight help, I'd have preferred the screw-on "piggy-back" type adapters that Denon, Audio Technica, and AKG use.  It makes it feel like a real 1/4 until you remove it.
 
I've never understood for any of them, though, the idea of including a 1/8 with a 1/4 adapter.  It would make far more sense to have a 1/4 with a 1/8 adapter (as Sennheiser does.)  You can always use the potential benefits of a 1/4 plug (durability and decreased resistance/impedance) and adapt down to 1/8.  If you start with 1/8, you don't get the benefits of 1/4 with an adapter.
 
Those Grado adapters are nice, I keep it permanantly connected to my Headroom so I can use it as a 1/4" jack.  I bought it when I'd temporarily lost my similar Sennheiser one.  I'm currently awaiting a BJC custom one though for keeping on my O2. 
 

 
I've managed to fall asleep, sitting up, with HD650's on running on Lyr.  Try that with HE-400

Of course that's why they're complimentary.   But my point was MickyVee and Headfonia's attempt to evaluate them as a comparison seems impossible to me, since I can find too little similar about them to be able to identify what I would compare them against. 
 

 
I think you may have remarkably different ears than I.    You've described HE-400 as bright, and now describe HE-400 and HD650 as very similar sounding?  Wasn't it you who also described HD650 as having "snappy transients" and "more upper-mids energy than HE-400" and didn't find HD650 laid back at all? Maybe you had the weirdest HD650 ever made!
 
Traditionally HE-500 has been considered HD650-like, and I added that I think HE-400 could be seen, also, as an alternate direction similar split from HD650, but I don't think I would extend so far as to say they sound similar either.  HD650 is still very laid back and has very warm mids.  HE-400 is either exciting, or "laid back yet exciting at the same time", and has very neutral mids.  HD650 is very mids-centric.  HE-400 is either very balanced, or slightly smile-shaped depending on perspective.  When in the mood for one or the other, the opposite would not suffice for me.  At closest, HE-400 seems like a hybrid of some of the best qualities of HD650 and K702 combined into one headphone.  But I don't think any of those three is truly similar to another.  K702 and D5k are the only two of my collection I'd say definitely have strong similarities in some areas.  I can't claim you're not hearing what you're hearing, it's just that I'm not hearing the same thing 
 
Oh, and I think you have one of the loose headbands.  My second pair is like that.  They could fall off easily.   My main pair, out of the box I would say had 3-4x the clamping force of HD650, which is to say painfully strong.   After stretching and bending the headband a bit they now have maybe 1.5-2x the force of HD650.  But still not as light as the other pair that is about .75x. There's some wicked manufacturing variance in HiFiMan headbands.  Or maybe more to the point, band steel from two different vendors.

Nah I've described the HE-400 to be dark since my very first impressions of them.  The only time I ever remotely considered them 'bright' if that's what you'd want to call it, is when I was could see how Tyll interpreted them.  They have a lot of upper treble energy beyond 10khz up to 15khz.  It's not the type of lower-mid treble around 7-10khz that makes a lot of other headphones very bright sounding and it's nowhere as invasive as the low-mid treble spikes, but it definitely has some sheen at the very highest of registers.
 
I'm ok with saying the HD650 has snappy transients, even coming out of an OTL amp.  It decays super fast and at times it seems almost too overdamped to me.  The HE-400 on the other hand sometimes seems almost too underdamped.  
 
I'm ok if people consider the HD650 laid back, whatever's laid back to them is laid back, but I'll never consider it as such.  It has too much upper mids for my liking, and that effect only gets aggravated by the simple fact that it's a headphone that shoves all that upper mid energy straight into your ears.  Laid back is more characteristic to particular songs than an actual headphone but eh.

The first two sound better to me, I'm not sure I'd call either "too" over/underdamped, but I'd agree that HD650 has significant damping and HE-400 has minimal damping.  That can also be visibly seen by looking at all the padding/damping in HD650 and the lack of in HE-400.  It's also why HE-400 excels in live recordings and big hall sounds with a lot of reverb where HD650 excels in the laid back sound.  I equate all HP coloration as how it relates to live music.  HD650 sounds like musicians playing a private session in your carpeted living room (or for classical sounds like mid-venue seating.)  K702 sounds like front-row stage-side seating.  HE-400 sounds like mid-seating at a concert venue or jazz club, and balcony seating at the orchestra.  D5k sounds, for wood instruments, like stage-level, listening to the actual instrument.  And of course for electronic which has no real-world equivalent, sounds like very detailed bassy speakers.
 
"Laid back" as associated with HD650 is definitely that "playing a personal show in a carpeted room" sort of vibe.  Sort of background, relaxing, etc.  You're the only person I've heard describe them as energetic bordering forward. Their effect on genres such as metal produces what I like to call "lounge metal."  
 
Unless you like to crank the volume.  Then all bets are off!

It pairs very well.   I prefer the sound of the Lyr, significantly, with the HE-400, purely based on personal preference of the warm-yet-detailed sound from the tube hybrid. However, a few pages back I described my experience with HE-400 on O2 as being more of what I picture HE-500 with silver cable sounds like.  It's more detailed, sharp, "refined", than the syrupy goodness on the Lyr, but sounds good and arguably more detailed on O2.  I did a full jazz CD on O2 + HE-400 the other day, and after I while I only slightly missed my tubey Lyr's sound with them 
 

 
In terms of SS, O2 isn't "perfect", we're not talking Phonitor here, but it's very very clean and pure, even analytical.  From a sound perspective there's nothing wrong with wanting SS reliability but with a tubey tonality as some of the more colored SS amps provide, but I agree, if you want to go the tube/hybrid route, why not just go in all the way and get tubes which will do it better.  From a build perspective, there's some rickety-ness to an O2...the micro volume pot that's somewhat rough and with some channel imbalance at the poles, rickety 1/8" jacks compared to nice Nutrik 1/4" jacks, no RCA's etc external power supply that make it just a little less nice to handle than some of its bigger SS cousins.   But at the price, at least until the ODA version exists, it's hard not to recommend if one isn't looking for coloration.

I wanted to do a slight update here. I picked up a second d5k yesterday. The first one that I bought several months had a defective cable and I ended up just returning it and kept my d2k, Well, I decided that the d5k was worth another shot. Man, I'm so very glad that I did. Here is my impression after a couple of hours:
 
 
Wow...I continue to be impressed with the improvement that I'm hearing in the d5k over the d2k. As much as I was let down by the first pair I bought-defective cable, these are just wonderful.
 
I was expecting tighter bass with more texture-tick, even better than I though it would be.
 
I was also expecting smoother mids given the wooden cups-tick here also. Silky smooth and easier to listen to and possibly less fatiguing. 
 
What I wasn't expecting was better imagining which is what I'm hearing. The imaging is up a couple of notches over the d2k and just beautiful.

Great write-up!  My only critique of it is that it falls into the exact same trap, a little, that most of the professional reviews do, which is why HE-400 is probably the most impossible to categorize headphone.  You discussed the price difference from 400 to 500 being mostly due to the automation, but so many paragraphs read like you're trying to evaluate them with the pre-conception that they're from a lower tier and should have certain flaws.  It's not a knock on you, I haven't seen a single pro critic not do the exact same thing. 
 
But imagine if both headphones were $700 right now.  Think of what that would change in the review, positive or negative?  Does HE-400 have any flaws that would be unforgivable at the same price as HE-500?  Does it have any advantages that would suddenly appear instead of being flaws if they were both $700 headphones?  That sort of thing. Would HE-500 have some unforgivable flaws at an even price point where HE-400 would win?   I realize you don't have both, wje does, but those are the kinds of things I'd love to have seen from the pros, so it always pains me to see a subconcious attempt to pre-categorize this headphone as "the lower tier", since it's bound to have many differences unrelated to "better or worse" just by being voiced differently, and it would be a more true comparison to assume both are equals and contrast the strengths and weaknesses, than to start with the assumption that HE-500 is better, therefore all differences are a result of that. I liken the difference between HE-400 & HE-500 more as the difference between HD600 & HD650 than HD650 vs HD800. HD650 is technically superior to HD600, and is pricier, but they're so different that while one is technologically superior it would be impossible to subjectively or even objectively call one better than the other.  Each has a different signature and that's the overriding difference.  Manufactured via the same means, I think HE-400 and HE-500 would fit that description as well. 
 

 
Agreed, for me HD650 takes a bit more maintenance and tuning to get just right.  It's fickle but rewarding if you do it.  HE-400 sounds more "like itself" without special setups.  However if one wants to throw good money after bad into HD650, I think HD650 can easily pull away as superior.  HD650, out of the box (already at $100 more than HE-400) on a moderate amp/DAC, I think HE-400 would be the most pleasing.  However tuning amp/dac/tubes (if so inclined)/cable (if one believes such things) for HD650 can easily scale it up past HE-400, where HE-400 holds fairly true to itself without being able to coax too much more out of it.  But of course, that HD650 amp/dac/tubes can also benefit HE-400 to a degree.
 
I love both, and enjoy both almost equally, but the tube upgrade was the final push for HD650 after the silver cable.  It now holds the crown for the top spot on my head rather securely again, at least until such time I cave and get HD800 or so.  At current price, I don't see that happening easily, or ever.  Not that the tubes don't help HE-400 as well.  But I think HD650 gets more from them.

If the new Denons are much like the old Denons, I would consider them "semi-closed", not closed.  They still let a lot of sound in and out.  HiFiMan is the most open headphone around, they allow more sound in and more sound out than pretty much anything.  HD650 is a bit more attenuating in both directions due to the stainless damping screen and all the foam packed in behind the driver.  The old Denons with the semi-open cup is somewhat more attenuating than that, but only somewhat.  It's more of a "shield" than a "closed cup."
 
If the new ones are much the same in design, I wouldn't go Denon if looking for isolation.  The semi-closed system is all about containing the bass frequencies as a rear-baffle in to enhance extension more than it is about isolation.   It's about as closed as a ported subwoofer

I see your point, but it's somewhat unavoidable. HiFiMAN sets the prices and thus sets the HE-400 up to be viewed in a certain context. I enter into a review in light of that context, though by the end I sometimes find that the item has transcended its particular category and actually competes on a higher level. Or sometimes the opposite is true (unfortunately).
 
I somewhat agree with your HE-400/500 to HD600/650 analogy, but not completely. I think the HD650 is very closely related to the HD600, with a different tuning. It may be slightly more technically correct, but not by a large margin. Also, there are many who feel that the HD600 remains the more accurate model, at the expense of being less fun. On the other hand, HE-500 is clearly technically superior to HE-400. See the InnerFidelity measurements - specifically the square waves, THD+noise, and impulse response. It isn't a matter of the HE-400 simply having a more "fun" sound sig while the HE-500 is more accurate - the HE-500 is better in a number of ways. That doesn't mean the HE-400 is bad, nor does it mean one can't prefer it. But I do see the HE-500 justifiably belonging to a higher tier, one that isn't artificially created by price.

Okay, I've had five days now on the Asgard and htr msii so I thought that I'd post some impressions. This will be a brief review of how this amp/dac work with the he400 and d5k for comparison. 
 
There is only one fitting title for this mini review, so let me get this out of the way now: "Hot Schitt!!" The Asgard gets about as hot as a Belgium waffle iron. Crazy hot. I suppose that Schitt is not having build issues with this heat as the whole case, made of aluminum, acted as a heat sink. I think it would be fair to say that the amp would a degree or two to the room temperature. 
 
Now that I've got that out of the way...on to the sound. I had used the fiio17 with both sets of headphones for about a month before I got the new amp setup. So that is my point of reference and the amp that I'll be comparing to. The Asgard/msii is definitely better but only marginally and that varies depending on which hp I'm listening with. More on that later.
 
The Asgard is leaning more towards neutral compared to the e17 and other amps that I've owned. In general it tightens the bass and rolls off the highs just a touch. For me this setup has become almost a perfect match for the d5k. It tames the bass slightly while at the same time giving it good texture and nice impact. I was blown away the first time that I listened to the Asgard with the d5k. IMO that denon can be a touch bright. With the highs rolled off ever so slightly and the bass hitting hard with improved impact....it was heaven. Also the new sound signature was a bit less fatiguing. I have not heard a better combination of amp/dac for the d5k than Asgard/msii. For the price point and the sound quality, I feel this setup is the sweet spot for the denon line. I don't call myself a loud listener of music. For those that have the fiio e17, I usually listen between 20-30 on low gain with the d5k and the same with he400 except +12 on the gain. There is A LOT more volume/power on the Schitt. But what I really like about cranking up the Asgard is that it doesn't just get instantly loud. The volume just seems to get fuller and more presence with no loss of quality. 
 
Now for the he400, the pairing of Asgard/msii is very good but not quite as good as it was for the d5k. Because the he400 has that wonderfully dark signature, I really don't feel the need to roll off the treble like I do with the d5k. Also, the bass with the he400's doesn't need to be tightened. It's one of the things that I really enjoy about them. Now granted these changes are very small and compared mostly to the e17. The Asgard is better sounding than the e17 with the HFM, but the level of improvement here is smaller than with the d5k.
 
Bottom line impressions:
 
Fiio e17:
 
d5k=7 of 10
he400=8 of 10
 
Asgard/msii
 
d5k=9 of 10
he400=9 of 10
 
*After a few additional nights of listening, I've changed my score on the Asgard/he400 to a 9 of 10

While the HE-400s don't need the speaker taps, doing so is not just for the sake of the output power itself.  On most receivers or amplifiers, the headphone stage is pretty mediocre.  To get around this issue, the taps are used -- where one can utilize the audio spectrum that is being fed from the amps itself, and not some separate op-amp stage that handles the headphone jack.  Also, I'm not so keen on the vintage items at the moment.  Most are teetering at the point of needing a rebuild at the age of 30 or 35 years old.  Caps need to be replaced, among other components.  My last receiver, a vintage Sansui, worked great with my Grado headphones and the headphone jack.  However, as soon as I desire to use the taps, the HifiMAN headphones picked up a lot of noise coming from the amps.  I figured that the components were getting weak and were not up to the task to deliver solid sound - that would also be quiet during slower passages in music.  Instead, I prefer the new Yamaha stereo gear.  I have 3 of their pieces and love each one of them.  The taps do great with them.  However, one of my 2-channel receivers, the RX-797, has a very, very good headphone stage.
 
Please keep in mind that orthodynamic drivers are constructed to handle power.  They are quite a bit unlike regular, dynamic drivers, which would shrivel to pieces with too much power.  I was looking at the AKG K701 at one point, and I think they indicated 200mW was the max input for those headphones.

Believe me, I love vintage gear.  For it was the vintage gear that was "new" when I was growing up.  My audio love started 35+ years ago.  However, I think that places like eBay, etc. are and can be a horrible place to pick up used gear at the moment.  eBay sellers see that the same model sold a week earlier for $x, so they think that their piece is worth the same or more.  There are some gems out there for the picking, but one has to carefully tread.  In some cases, the vintage pieces are approaching prices that should only be paid if a piece were restored with new capacitors, etc.
 
However, when I purchased the Yamaha RX-797 from a guy locally on Craigslist, he had a nice 2-channel Marantz vintage piece.  The exterior was pristine and he indicated he had only paid $150 for it on Craigslist.  He recently had it serviced by an electronics shop that is local and their charge to go through the receiver and replace some of the components that were "on the edge" was about $200.  This did not include any capacitor replacements, from what I could tell - but, they indicated, the caps were still good.  The shop is actually a very reputable shop as a few of the technicians that work there, were former employees of Conrad Johnson.  I don't think one's resume could be much more impressive than that, to have had that experience working for such a company.

Correct.  However, on the same vintage receiver - my Sansui 881, my Grados performed really good using the headphone jack and it could clearly be seen how wires and resistors were connected to the speaker "outs" on the back of the receiver.  Even my HifiMAN headphones sounded quite good with the headphone jack itself.  It is when I built the taps and switched over to the balanced connection, I noticed all of the extra noise through the channels on my HifiMAN headphones.  I suspect the resistors on the headphone stage were enough to keep most of the "noise" quieted.  However, when all cards were laid on the table with the speaker taps, that's when things changed.  Ironically, the Sansui was fine when using speakers connected to the speaker channels.  I guess it all came down to how sensitive the HifiMANs were in relation to the power source that they were connected to.

Some of the headphone amplifiers put out 5 or 6 watts of power.  On some headphones, even that amount of power could be dangerous.  Speaker taps don't have to be built "in the raw" -- as one can utilize an appropriate resistor on the "+" connection to allow for better protection.  Additionally, I see all kinds of members going back and forth between $500, $350, $600 amplifiers ... buying, selling, buying - just to get the right amp and losing money on each deal.  The receivers and amplifiers that I'm referring to usually are about $100 to $150 (used) and have a lot of features.  Some controls over the tone, a balance control if needed, sleep timers, multiple inputs, etc.
 
I think good, stereo receivers are far overlooked.  Also, as I had mentioned, the Yamaha RX-797 has a great headphone output stage - so, if there's anyone who has a fear of running speaker taps, there is no need for the taps in this case, because the beautiful sound is already there.  I'm not into telling people that they should spend $300, $400 or $500 more than they have to, when great equipment can be had for less than the boutique headphone amplifiers.  And, I'm not Schiiting you either.

Just a few thoughts after no more than 8 hrs listening.
I'm not hearing what I'd call an overly dark headphone,warm to me,I found 650's a little darker,but given a few days and praps I'll change my mind?dark headphones for me were my old 80's 600ohm beyerdynamic 990's,dark as in sonically being in a 50ft square room holding a candle lol
The 400's have very slightly forward mids,not so much to unbalance the sound,but just enough to make music exciting when needed.
Soundstage is not huge,but plenty big enough for me,width,height and depth are fine,not going into detail yet,grown wiser with age to develop opinions on sound over a little more time,suffice to say I love these so far tho.
I find the black canare cable ok,not really annoying me in use.The 400's feel pretty comfortable,well made far as I can tell and I like the blue!
I find the weight of these fine,but wouldn't be crazy bout anything heavier.

I've wanted to build me some crack for a long time, but dang they're a little expensive for my student budget. Besides, I think I want something a little less warm than a tube amp for these, since I like my headphones with a bit of shimmer (previous Grado/Sextett owner, I went with the HE-400 over the DT880 since I heard the DT880 was a little laid back for rock). I've been trying to find an excuse to venture into tubes for some time now, but if I do it'll probably be via a Starving Student, or a more simple 8DJ6 hybrid amp. In all probability though, this next amp will be solid state, either a Pimeta, a Dynalo, or maybe a heavily modified Cmoy/Apheard with an opamp driven, buffered virtual ground
 
 
In other news, I was listening last night to some female vocals (some Within Temptation), out of my Marantz 2245 to my HE-400's, and WOW, they sound Great! a little warm for my taste, but very very lush, and still crystal clear. I can't wait to have the pioneer SX-780 (which is supposed to be a little brighter) up and running so I can do a comparison.

HE-400?   Or perhaps HE-500 or LCD-2?
 
I am looking for some advice.  I have never owned a decent pair of headphones and the idea of spending lots of money for something I have not heard before is something that makes me a bit uneasy. That said, some background on my eqipment and music preferences....
 
I listen to about 40% classic rock / hard rock, 40% jazz (mostly female jazz vocal & classics like Monk, Coltrane), the rest essentially classical and blues.  The headphones would be for my main stereo and I plan to just purchase one set of cans.  I have an OPPO95 connected to my home network.  Almost half of the music I would listen to with the headphones would be 24 bit FLAC / WAV, DVD-Audio, or SACD.  Rest would be CDs.  The OPPO95 is connected via balanced interconnects to a Moon 350P preamp that has a discrete headphone section.  I want to use this connection rather than purchase an additional headphone amp unless the Moon 350P is really not going to do a reasonable job driving the headphones. 
 
If I use the Moon 350P to drive one of these headphones, would the HE-400 be the best option given its relative efficiency?  Any thoughts on how the HE-500 or LCD-2 would perform in comparision with the Moon 350P?
 
I am not very knowledgeable on specs, so I am hoping someone can guide a newbie in the right direction.

Certainly.  I have K702  which may be slightly different (or not slightly different, depending on who you ask) from current production Q701.  Both are extremely different. 
 
The AKGs' have a very wide soundstage.  One of the widest this side of HD800.  They're VERY flat, bass-lean (good extension, light presence.) They have a very dry, crisp, analytical presentation, and can be at times slightly bright (but never sibilant.)  They're one of the finest for studio type prescision of hearing exactly what's on the disc.
 
The HE-400's have that characteristic ortho/planar sound of being very fluid and smooth.  They have a weighty low end with both good bass extension and presence/impact.)  They're definitely not lacking in treble detail, but they have a more "natural" tonal balance compared to the AKG's more "neutral" tonal balance (natural and neutral are not the same thing.)  A bit more "alive" feeling.  HE-400 is also one of the darkest headphones around.  Darker than HD650, and the only other headphone often referred to as dark is LCD-2...which may actually be even darker.  The soundstage is not as wide as the K702, but it has somewhat better center image and instrument separation, especially with velour pads.   Planars all do a very good job at instrument separation. 
 
Honestly the AKGs are relatively complimentary to almost anything because so few things are so dead-flat neutral, so if one likes a very neutral, airy, analytical sound, it's a great headphone to have in the mix.  I love my AKGs, but I wouldn't want to listen to them as my primary headphone. Too bright and analytical.
 

 
I doubt any authorized dealer is still selling "Revision 1" drivers.  They were the first batch out the door, were sold out before they were even done making them, and were effectively recalled due to a serious flaw.  Anything not used, and not gray-market should be either "revision 2" or a "repaired production revision 1."  The difference isn't related to sound but to build.  At least officially...   The Revision 1 problem was a flaw in a joint that made one channel mostly drop out on a good number of that first batch.

I have few questions.
 
a. How long will these last? I read somewhere that planar magnetic has shorter life span than traditional dynamic driver? Is that true? Can it make like 5-6 years of regular use?
EDIT: plus, I'm interested too about the life span of a common headphone, I mean do they really get busted in time? I have a speaker and I think it's 7 years+ and it's still sounding as good. Headphones not the same?
 
b. Is this fast enough to handle extreme metal genres? I really think they can and they should but I'm interested about impressions of those who have listened to metal with lots of complex transitions and has very fast double bass drum with these.
 
c. can these be driven by just say E17? I'm guessing too that they can but I want to know how much % of SQ I will be missing since I still have no money to invest on a really good amp.
 
Thank you.

In all probability, not explicitly so.  However theoretically there can be due to the difference in surface area, particularly on the ground ring.   1/8" tends to have a higher resistance (and thus higher impedance) than 1/4.  There's a relatively little chance of audible difference, however the theoretical difference can be measured, and has been sited as an unknown potential for improved sound quality along with RCA jacks versus 1/8 for inputs on the ODA versus the O2 by the famously skeptical designer. 
 
Now keep in mind that difference is specifically for true 1/4 termination versus 1/8 with a 1/4 adapter termination.   The theoretical advantage goes to true 1/4 termination.   1/8 with a screwdown 1/4 probably picks up a good bit of the advantages as well since the contact should be pretty secure on those.  But not all of it I would guess.   A snap-on adapter is probably no different than plugging straight into a 1/8 jack. Same kind of contact.
 
We're talking about theoretical and potentially measurable difference...we'll leave the audible part of the difference out of the equation   But placebo can be powerful...."I can hear all the detail lost at the jack!" 
 
 

 
Take a look at the "Vintage Ortho" thread....where there's lots of discussion about orthos from the 80's...the original Yamahas and vintage Fostex.  I think it's safe to say that ortho tech can last a very long time.  Whether HiFiMans do or don't, they're too new to know.  You'd have to find the oldest HE-6 or HE-5 which is only a couple years old and track it for a few decades to see. 
 
A good loudspeaker should be able to live longer than you will.  A 10 year life on a speaker is considered a dismal failure.  And usually a 10 year failure is due to foam surrounds degrading on cheaper ones.  Headphones don't use foam surrounds.
 
Also, orthos are inherantly fast.  There are faster ones like HE-6, of course, and if you crave ultimate speed you can go for that 200lb 100W headphone   That's why they have huge, heavy magnet arrays.  But all orthos would be considered "fast" by dynamic standards, though maybe not as fast as the absolute fastest dynamics such as HD800 and TH900.
 
  
=============================================
Topic: 8551130 in thread 604583
=============================================



Oh I can't say whether old orthos are more durable than old dynamics or not. The idea is...there seem to be plent of both still around. There's not that much that can break on a heaphone . The coils could become too oxidized to be useful, paper cones can wear down and decay if not treated well (which shouldn't be an issue since most orhos are mylar/silk and most dynamics are treated paper or poly at these price points.) There's no foam surrounds to worry about . Magnets, if poorly made can lose their strength. But "lifespans" on headphones are pretty unknown items. Not many people have seen a headphone simply die of something other than amp failure, mishandling, mususe of volume, etc. Or physical breakage of headbands and gimbals or terminal jacks. Broken wires for hardwired cans are common, but these aren't hardwired.
Headphones overall are durable....speakers overall are durable. Poor construction can make them not durable, and HFM is too new a brand, as is Audeze, to know their long-term duraility. I know both HFM and Audeze have had some driver issues, both of which are due to manufacturing issues, not the nature of the drivers themselves. I doubt one is technically no more durable than the other as a general tech
HD800 is probably the fastest non-electrostat around. TH900, and HE6 probably compete for that title. Maybe on a stretch LCD-3. Beyond that you're into Stax and Orpheus land
Tat's not to sa that any other ortho, even the former Senn/Beyer/Grado/AKG flagships are truly THAT far behind. HE-400 shouldn't be considered f ultimate speed is the goal. HE-6 is HFMs entry in that particular market. But ultra fast cans are generally also ultra lean and bright. Or u-shaped.

I wonder if the HE-400 is using the HifiMAN silver cable with the E17?  Plus, younger ears could be more sensitive to higher frequencies.  Just a thought ...
 
Unfortunately, I didn't get to hear the LCD-2s at the meet.  I really wanted to get a perspective of many headphones, but didn't.  Others in the Fostex thread have indicated that the T50RP, when appropriately modified, can provide approximately 90% of the performance of the LCD-2.  This is the reason why I wanted to hear the LCD-2.  Maybe, next time.  I think I've learned that with the meets, I'd like to alternate.  One time, I'll pack up gear and bring it along.  The next time, I'd just go there to see the gear, and spend time collecting a perspective of a few of the headphone models.  Vlad did tell me on Saturday that he's thinking of organizing another such meet for about 6 months down the road.  I think it will be exciting if he does.

I've though of creating a new thread about this but decided to just post here since this headphone is the most I'm worried about.
 
We have lots mold forming in our house, I dunno but I think the occational rain caused it. Some closets, my leather shoes, (and other organic? materials). Can the molds form in the drivers of the headphone?? Or is it like treated paper that the mold wouldn't want to live there? I'm worried that the country I live in is not healthy for the headphone, is there anyway to combat those mold forming F$&#$#!? I've googled some info about it. I've already tried the dehumidifier months ago and I think they just grow more rapidly.. :\ I used to wipe those off with some cloth with alcohol but I definitely can't do it inside the headphone if it occur. Can you suggest a way to prevent those freakin' molds? Or they will not form on headphone drivers? I'm also concerned about my Beyer. :( Btw, I will pick up my pair later from a friend. :D

My pair finally arrived! I've spent 4 hours with them last night. Here are my initial impressions...
I've noticed that electric guitars don't sound that vocal to my ears with this headphone, or that they lack that semi-nasalness of my DT 1350 (which I really like). The electric guitar tone that should sound "awwe" sounds "eee" to them. Or being somewhat thin rather than a full bodied guitar tone. Its approach in mids was like with the MX 471 earbuds, while my DT 1350 is MX 980. Not to say that they are of low quality because obviously they are not. It just sounds kinda stiff to me and some instruments can be more pronounced.
 
I like the bass response though. It is quick, tight but still clear and impactful. But I'm already used to my DT 1350s bass and it's like bathing your ears with very high quality (fast and tight, yet very detailed and extends so freakin' well) bass but never lets other frequencies suffer from it. So yeah, the HE-400 bass doesn't get lost with other frequencies or doesn't let other frequencies get lost with itself. BUT I'm spoiled to that oozing or bottomless and very detailed bass the DT 1350s possess so I don't consider HE-400s bass phenomenal.
 
I don't focus much in the highs but I like HE-400s highs. It can be compared to my MX 980s as they are open and extends well and without sensing it as being rolled-off. I like it better than my DT 1350s highs as even their highs are detailed/sharp, they somewhat lack that crystal clear highs feeling I have on the MX 980 and HE-400. I should also note that of all my headphones/IEMs/earbuds, HE-400 is where I hear clipping on recordings the most. They are very transparent that you can hear even the slightest treble peak on some recording. At first I thought the left driver was defective and has obvious treble spike listening to the intro of Wonderful Slippery Thing of Guthrie Govan's. Then I swithched to my beyer and heard it too, its just too obvious with the HE-400. Technically, it's a good thing. :)
 
I have tried A/Bing the velour and pleather pads several times (3-4 times) last night, and my findings are the velours really improve the headphone. It made the bass more clear and defined, more crunch in the mids, and I think it made the overall spectrum more transparent by a big margin. Not sure if it was the material itself or the velour being thicker than pleather that changed the angle of the cups to the ears like some say that causes the big improvement. However, my ears still touches the drivers with either pleather or velour if that makes sense.
 
This is my first full-size headphone so my ears still adjust to the placing of the instruments :D. I really hope the mids change to sound more open than stiff (but I heard planar magnetics don't change that much from burn-in?). I think I still remember how my DT 1350 sounded out of the box and I think it doesn't sound that vocal with distorted electric guitars too at first (fingers-crossed).

My initial impressions to these headphones weren't as good as I expected. I'm expecting that I will be overjoyed the first time I listen to them.
Maybe the primary reason for it is that I'm really tired that night, plus my ears are also exhausted due to the loud GR07 the whole afternoon. lol.

I've had the chance to listen to them the second time last night (too busy to listen to them every night on week days) and WOW, they are incredible!
They are so detailed especially the highs, I heard the cymbals like I never did before, they have body in them, but crisp and crystal clear. I don't know if it's a common thing in full-size headphones since this is my only one, but damn, I cannot stress enough how happy I am with them last night. They are so insanely transparent and well textured. The bass is tight (may be even tighter than the DT 1350!).
About my complain in the mids department, I think I'm comparing my DT 1350 to them a little bit too much. They just have different voicing but neither is wrong. Actually I think my beyer is the one that is over emphasizing the "aawwe" sound in electric guitars, the HE-400 is more flat and true. Once I accepted how they're voiced and stop insiting that they should sound close to the beyer, I understood how it really presents music and it is freakin' good! At first I admit I concluded that they don't or won't really do well in rock/metal or when a good distorted guitar tone is required, but nope, I was entirely wrong. I love how they do those things as they are so transparent and still has a sense of rawness in them. Maybe a little bit more refined compared to my DT 1350 but that doesn't make them less adequate to handle those types of genres. I listened to RATM and the guitars sounded really good. And The Faceless tracks really show how fast they are. There isn't really a song where they seem to hold back or have a hard time rendering. I throwed every complex song I have on them and they render it sooo effortlessly. Love them! I can't wait for the weekend to spend more time with them. :)
 
Thanks Matt, won't be so convinced to buy a $400 headphone (even if it's planar magenetic) if not because of your thread!

For those who are interested in a straight comparison between the he400 and he500, here are my thoughts...
 
 
 
I got about two and a half hours of listening/comparison done today once the he500 got here. Basically, this is my opinion:
 
1. The he500 needs at least a mid-fi amp and dac to reach it's potential. My e09k and odac are not enough to drive it properly even on high gain. On the fiio/odac combo the he400 sound noticeably better. 
 
2. On a Class A amp with proper power, I have the nfb-6, the he500 begins to shine and ultimately outclasses the he400. Under this condition the difference between the two is exposed, which is that the mids of the he500 are clearly superior. Although it's worth noting that the he400 also improves across the spectrum with the nfb-6. 
 
3. The impact and texture of the bass with the he400 is better under both setups. I like a little warmer bass in the presentation of music and the he400 hits the sweet spot for me. While the mids of the he500 were smile inducing, I found myself quickly looking for more bass impact. Please don't misunderstand. The mids on the he400 are good...very good. But the mids on the he500 are some of the best out there. Outlclassed by the likes of the he6 and a few select others that would require you to take out a second mortgage to own. 
 
4. At the end of the day, the he400 is for me...no question. I prefer the bass, the versatility of a headphone that is more easily driven even in a portable setup and the sticker price sits quite a bit better with me. 
 
Stepping back from  the listening session, it suddenly became clear that while all the comments I made were on target and that the differences were certainly there, I was omitting a simple truth. The he400 and he500 do in fact sound a lot alike. These differences are not night and day and require a trained and patient  ear to appreciate. They are both wonderful headphones. At $400, about $360 on sale at Moon Audio, there is no doubt that the he400 is a special hp and one of the best deals out there today.

All gain switches are set to off on my Mk II and Mk III. Feedback is introduced when using the gain switches so I don't use it.
 
I've had best luck with Russian driver tubes and Russian power tubes on my Mk II. IMO, this is a highly under-rated amp with low imp cans. HE-400 never goes above 12 o'clock, just too loud. Not only is it loud enough but produces a very rich, warm tube sound. It compares favorably to my E17, Objective 2, and Asgard.
 
The Mk III is a bit more laid back, most likely because of it's implementation, but works wonderfully with the HE-400. Plenty of power. The LD OTL's are a fantastic value for a tube lover.
 
I should mention I feed these amps from dedicated SACD optical players that provide more voltage (2V) to the L/R inputs than your typical portable player.

Fantastic comparison.  Reinforcing what you've said here, I'd go as far as to say that even the HE-6 sounds a lot alike HE-400.  Yes, it outclasses it easily, but it's more about continued refinement than it is about radical differences.  I can pleasantly listen to the HE-400 after the HE-6 and not feel I'm listening to something vastly inferior.  Yes I can tell some of the open stage, transparency and extreme detail resolution is reduced quickly enough, but not enough to make the HE-400 feel poor next to it.  That's not to say that HE-6 doesn't have very obvious improvements, but it says that it's all in the subtleties, not huge swings.  More resolution, more linear response, more natural timbres, more clarity in distances.  But it builds upon the same base.
 
HE-400 is a fantastic deal!  That's not to say it's the only excellent headphone at this price point, but it's certainly a legend of its time, making the "trio" of HD650, DT880, and K701 into a quartet!

I'm a long time lurker here at head-fi also and have finally got around to joining.
 
I currently own a pair of Shure srh-840's and M-audio q40's which i have enjoyed immensely after using them for about a year now, that though was previously coming for the ignorance and bliss of thinking apple earbuds sounded perfectly fine. 
 
Now i'm looking for a high-end headphone rig to use with my pc. After spending hours and hours reading i'm now mainly looking at the HE-400 or possibly HE-500. I mainly listen to modern music/Hip-hop I guess but have been getting into a lot more audiophile type music recently. 
 
With a budget of about $800 including a DAC/amp just wondering what would be best? I presume this M-audio Fast Track I'm using will need to be upgraded, but not sure how good it sounds as I've used nothing but my ipod and galaxy to compare it to. Lastly I've been looking at an asus st/stx or Asus E1 for the amp and dac has anyone tested these with the HE-400/500?

I read this thread and decided to buy a pair of HE400. I received them a couple of weeks ago from headdirect but I can't say that I agree with anything that's being said here, which is especially surprising since I also own a pair of DT990 (the pro 250ohm version though). I am starting to think that I have received a defective pair... is that even possible?
First of all, the day I got them was extremely hot here in italy (around 35 C with high umidity) and those pads DO make you sweat alot! (I could wear the velour ones of the 990 for at least 10 minutes before being uncomfortable). But this is a minor point and becomes relevant only in summer (it's way better now :) ).
But the sound! Compared to the DT990, or even the Grado SR325is, or even the AKG 701... these have the most recessed sound of all my cans! I use the headphone output from my desktop cd player (Denon DCD 1450AR), which is very powerful I think, and with the beyers the volume knob rarely goes beyond 3. If I want the same sound level with the HE400 I have to push it to 6 or 7!
Also, they have FAR less energy at the higher frequencies which, admittedly, has some positive effects (less fatiguing, no sibilance), but, together with the cavernous sound, gives somewhat of a 'distant' feel to the whole hearing experience. One instrument that is very nicely rendered with these cans is acoustic guitar. All in all, though, they sound more similar to a closed phone than an open one to me. They certainly do not render classical music well AT ALL! (this is also because classical music cds typically have a much lower volume than everything else, hence a very forward sounding headphone is required)
Im not saying these are bad or anything, they are certainly detailed and have their strenghts, but overall I just don't relate very much with the opinions voiced here, especially by the thread starter (I would never say they trump the DT990 on every front, although these are certainly less suited to non-symphonic music, being very bright and forward).
I haven't read all the 44 pages of the thread though, if someone else finds the cans too recessed and laid back maybe I'll stop thinking that I got a defective pair...

The use of a Nakamichi might actually fare better than an actual headphone amplifier.  The older receivers tend to have been headphone-out sections than the newer audio / video receivers.  However, I've found that the newer Yamaha stereo receivers have great headphone sections on them, which is what I mainly use for my listening.  I've found that headphone amps tend to be in the love / hate category of a relationship.  Some are really loved and perform well, while others cost a lot and don't perform too good.  If you feel that you've achieved a big success in picking the HE-400 and are enjoying the sound, then that was an easy achievement.  But, finding the right headphone amp may take a bit longer, in my experience.
 
I didn't realize Crutchfield was carrying HifiMAN - that's good to know.  The unfortunate part for me, is that since I live in the same state they are located, I have to pay the sales tax.  However, they are just a 2-hour drive (scenic country) from where I live and they do have a retail storefront shop, too.  Additionally, part of that retail store is also a store where they sell their returned items at a discount.  The last time I was there, they had large amounts of speakers and other goods. It would be interesting to see what kind of headphone returns they have, and how well they might discount them.

I've done some more experimenting with my PC and it really is the 3-6Khz drop that gives these phones their very recessed, closed off sound. When properly equalized, they do sound nice both with popular and classical music (although I still find my other phones better suited for one or the other). I also noticed that the more expensive models don't have quite a drop like the HE400 in the midrange, but they are far too hard to drive (at least for my E9, which isn't all that great anyway).
I was thinking of trading these for a pair of Denon D5000 but I guess I'll keep them and use them in my second home with the computer. Now, I'd like to know what exactly is the difference with the velour pads. Im not much concerned with comfort, the stock pads are good enough if it's not too hot, but do the velour ones help bring out the mids by any chance?
10$ is not alot, but it's another 10$ to have them shipped to italy from head-direct...

 Yes they have, and thank you so much for loaning them to me. Hopefully absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder. I know I enjoyed the time I spent with them, and I can certainly understand all the plaudits they've been receiving in the various threads. I think for $399, one would be hard pressed to find another can that does what the HE 400 does. IMO it offers a lot of value for a head fier that is looking for a great all arounder. or as Jerg posited: a dark, polite, dynamic sound that shimmers. Other posts have talked about them being laid back, and others still have used the word recessed. I think thats pretty accurate I found them laid back to the point of being polite too. So in that way they arent totally my cup of tea. I listen to a lot of bluesy guitar driven rock and I found them a little too laid back at times. They actually reminded me of the Denon d2000 a little that way. But that's sort of picking nits because they sounded really good. I watched Breaking Bad with them one night, and found they were killer for that sort of stuff too. As much as I liked them though, I think I prefer my HF2 to them...and I have a modded T50 that I enjoy also.
 
Overall though they look great, they sound great, and they're pretty comfortable despite being a little on the heavy side.

Welp, broke down and got some. I was listening to some Portapros the other day and realized I missed having virtually no bottom end with my otherwise beloved AD700s. Was alternatively tempted by the DT880s for supposed the overall balance and soundstage, and the Q701s because they look gorgeous.
 
Ordered from Crutchfield, as they had free 2 day ship, and a 60 day return policy. No velours yet, uDac 2 as source.
 
 
Impressions (Not that I've listened to enough phones to have a meaningful opinion):
 
Not as heavy as I feared, I wouldn't say they're uncomfortable at all, but when I put the AD700s back on they still feel more comfy. Will see how they do long-term for gaming and such.
Listened to some Ravel. Very very nice, sounds like I'm a few rows away from the orchestra pit. Has more presence and natural warmth, for lack of a better description, than the AD700s.
Definitely has more bottom end than the AD700s (duh), but not what I would call bassy at all.
Hard to explain why things sound better. Not sure older jazz works well with them though.
They do everything the AD700 did well, but better. For sure. Not sure $300 worth of better though. Still early though, takes time to acclimate ears and brains, both of which are getting fatigued right now.

Nothing, I mean nothing beats the AD700 for comfort, if they work for your head.   They're feather light, have no clamp and just kind of float on your head.  On the other hand it's 100% dependent on head shape and people they don't work for find they just fall off their head at the slightest motion.  But if it fits, AD700 is without a doubt the most comfortable thing around for any amount of money.
 
AD700 sound stage width and depth is also much deeper and wider than the somewhat confined HE-400.  Unfortunately AD700 seems to roll anything below 120Hz into a foam padded room...it simply has little to no bass.   AD-700 is the quintessential mid-fi headphone.  Really good performance for the money but with one or more serious compromises to do what it does get right.  HE-400 and the like is true hi-fi despite what some high-end hi-fi'ers promote. You're hearing that difference as you compare AD700.
 
HE-400 is very magical with classical.  There are places where I prefer HD650 to HE-400, and places I prefer HE-400.  Contrary to audiophile dogma that classical needs thin, bright, hyper-fast speakers, HE-400 sounds, to me, far more like a real concert hall.  Weighty with some around the head reverb without missing attack speed.  Jazz for me is split 50/50 between HD650 and HE-400.  Some recordings work better with one or the other and some work equally well on both. I said in another thread to someone to think of the differences between some of these headphones as listening in different venues.  You can listen to the same show as though you're hearing it in different buildings.
 
I'm not sure what your source chain is, but one thing HE-400 does (other than bass) that AD700 does not is scales well with signal chain.  Better amps, better sources do manifest in better performance from HE-400.   AD700 is sort of a one stop shop....what you get out of the box is what you'll always get.  Which is bad for building a hi-fi system but good for making portable devices sound good!
 

 
RE-0 is fantastic for the money.  First recommendation for them, though, is get a portable amp.  Not unlike most HiFiMan offerings they're not the most efficient things on the block.  The respond to raw power. The bass ends up missing without sufficient power.  They're also highly flat/analytical but not as much so as Etymotic ER4.  They might sound anemic without sufficient power behind them...it's sort of the HE-6 of IEMs.  Don't get me wrong, they sound good out of a stock iPod Touch with a bit of bass boost EQ, but they have a lot more potential than that. Personally I replaced the tips with Sony Hybrids....which famously don't insulate well.  I used the biflange for a while which isolated relatively ok but I didn't like the feeling of something that deep in my ear...and it itched.  They have a small bass port (it's a dynamic driver not a balanced armature) so they can't fully isolate ever, but they can isolate pretty well depending on your tip choice such as Comply foams.
 
Ultimately I replaced them with Sure SE535's....the appeal of use Sure "olives" (black foams) on the IEM they were designed for was very appealing...you can mod olives to work on RE0, but I never had much luck doing so.

Asgard and Lyr are both known to be fine with planars (Schiit's own site on the Valhalla FAQ specifically has a question relating to "can it power my low impedance orthos" and an answer referring to "Not a chance.  You want Lyr.  For LCD-2, HE-4, HE-500, Asgard would also work if you prefer SS." (I'm paraphrasing.) That FAQ predates the HE-400, but the idea is, generally, Asgard & Lyr will both do well with low impedance current hungry orthos, Valhalla simply will not behave in that setup...they push lots of voltage but little current.
 
So if HE-400 works (it's semi-sensitive, so it very wall may), it's probably the only ortho that would actually run well on it.  I'd just verify with someone that's tried it before counting on it working :) OTL & low impedance, low sensitivity is generally a no-go.  HE-400 is just on the cusp of "almost kind of sensitive." But I suspect it's also less sensitive than the printed spec.  Fang likes to play the numbers loose....

I headed home during lunch to get my package.  However, since it was insured (thanks Brian, seriously), they just left a post card in my mailbox.  So, I'll head to the P.O. tomorrow to pick up the HE-400s and the other variation of Fostex T50RPs to evaluate.  
 
Also, my pair of Audio Technica ATH-A900X headphones should be arriving from Canada within the next couple of days.  I'm getting excited to compare those to the HE-400s to see where they stand, in regards to a closed, non-orthodynamic headphone vs. the ortho.  While others might have been able to make such a comparison / test, I haven't been able to, up until now.  I do have the ATH-AD900, so I can compare the two open cans against each other.  The ATH-AD900 drivers are 53mm in size, so they are quite large - along the lines of the HE-400s, but they don't have the weight of the HE-400s (not that I'm ever complaining about the weight of the HE-400s, either.

I need some help choosing an amp. I will be buying the ultrasone signature pro some time, so I need a portable amp for it, I currently own a fiio e11 amp. These are my options:
 
-keep the fiio e11 and buy the HRT MusicStreamer, so I will use the e11 with the SigPro (the e11's amp is a bit better than the e17's amp) for portable use and both the e11 and the HRT MS with the HE400 at home.
 
-Buy a fiio e17 and use it with both the HE400 and the SigPro. The e11+hrt musicstreamer is obviously better for the he400, as for the SigPro, the amp in the e17's amp is a bit worse but it has a DAC as well which should be a bit better.
 
Which of these do you think would the best option. Will the e17 be a lot better than the e11 for the SigPro when using my iphone and will the e11+HRT MusicStreamer be a lot better than the e17 when using my he400?
 
Note that if I buy the e17, I will use it with the iphone a lot. Someone said somewhere on these forums regarding an amp for a headphone that to use with an iphone, the e11 would be better than the e17. Is that true? Does the DAC not work in an iphone or something like that?

OK some 'second' first thoughts after a few hours of listening times...
 
Design etc - 9/10
These are very nice headphones! I love the weight of them, yes they are heavier than my other cans but not too heavy. So far I am finding them very comfortable. They seem well built and I like the design and the blue colour.
 
Bass - 10/10
Bass response is excellent. It sounds tight/clean and the sub-bass is excellent. I don't think it could be better for myself. I like the bass part of music (not sure if I am a basshead or not?) and these deliver.
 
Mids - 9/10
Mids are, hmm I'm not sure how to describe it other than I like it. Apart from the HE400s I also have Grado 225s and Sony XB700s and the mids on the HE400s are so much better. Some songs are sounding different, in a good way, on others I can pick out more detail etc. I guess they would be described as forward, they are certainly not recessed.
 
Highs - 8/10
Having had the Grados I wanted something less bright and easier to listen to and these are, almost to the extent that I may EQ the higher frequencies up slightly! I definitley prefer it this way though.
 
Overall - 9/10
I am impressed with these at the moment. They seem to be pretty much exactly what I wanted from some headphones. Maybe the only aspect which could be better is the soundstage. It may be me but this doesnt seem too big?
 
The other thing i have noticed so far is that electronic music is made for these cans!

Hey guys, I need some help (again)...
 
I will be buying two headphones in the future, one open and one closed, I will be spending 700 dollars in one and 400 on the other. This is what Im thinking about:
 
I will either spend 400 dollars on a closed can (m100 or momentum) and 700 dollars on the HE500 so I will basically get a good closed can and a excellent open can. The other option it to spend 700-800 on a used ultrasone signature pro and 400 on the he400 so I will have an ultimate closed can which I can take everywhere and a mid-fi open can. To sum it all up: ultimate open can and good closed can VS ultimate closed can and good open can (Momentum + HE500 VS SigPro + HE400)
 
My question is: Is there a big amount of difference between the HE500 and the HE400? Is it worth not getting the signature pro and getting the momentum? How much difference is there between the HE400 and HE500. I always like the idea of having an "ultimate" closed can, so if there is not much difference between the he400 and the he500, I'll get the signature pro. I mainly listen to rock, pop rock, metal, and a little bit of electronic. The main thing I want is good mids (I love mids!) and a good, non fatiguing treble. Can anyone help me out? Money doesn't necessarily mean something is better, so do you think the HE400 might suit me better than the HE500 according to my music taste (good mids too)?

Here are my thoughts from a few weeks back:
 
 
I just don't hear the bass the same as some of the others hear. And I think it's good to have a variety of opinions. I've had the he400 for about 6 months and I just borrowed a pair of he500 from a member. I owned them before the he400 with the lyr, so I had a pretty good idea of what they sound like already.
 
I hear the he500 as a mid centric hp. Those mids are wonderfully textured and natural...some of the best that I've had the pleasure to hear. But the bass seems to loose focus from the equation. It's not bad but just not as good as the he400, which IMO opinion shifts the focus of the SQ equation somewhat away from the mids and to the bass. I listed over and over this morning to be sure that I didn't hear differently, but this is what I hear. He500=near perfect mids with more natural bass. He 400 good mids with slight emphasis on bass.
 
You might say that the he500 has a more natural accurate sound. I don't listen to hp's for that. I prefer a little more bass which is the very reason that I sold the he500 and bought the he400. For me, it's about perfect. And the truth is, these two hp's sound a lot alike. The differences are actually quite small. 
 
 
Hope this helps...

Hi, I am very new to the head-fi world. I am posting this just posting this because I want to know if I am doing something wrong. I demoed a pair of he-400's today and found them sound a little different then I expected. Bass was great but I am a guitar player who thinks the greates sound in the world is bridge pickup through a tc2290 into a ac30 with alnico blues. So I like things bright and chimey. When I ran some of my favorite guitar driven songs through the 400's the guitar seemed rather laid back and not present enough in the music. Through the Grado Rs1i's it was exactly how I wanted to hear it. It's just the Grado's don't have that amazing bass I heard in the 400's. So am I doing it wrong? I was using an IPhone 4s through a fiio e11. Or do I have to compromise? Right now I would pick up the Grado because I could live without the low end.

DF was a great DAC, but no so much as an amp. for the Orthos.
 
As I was on a budget, I've preferred selling the DF, and downgrade the DAC to something simpler, but with a better AMP.
That way, I can better enjoy my 400's... should no more be lack of bass (and sub-bass), and, with less veiled lo-mid voice. 
 
During my experience with some DACs and AMPs, learned that AMPs can serve as an hardware equalizer, and "color" the HPs differently. While giving different current amounts from each other.
 
A good "Synergy" would occur when enough current is given to a specific HP (demands are usually higher on Orthos than with Dynamics).
Also, the "color" that is given by the AMP, should not be too much identical to that the DAC gives, because we don't want it "too bright" or "too dark". otherwise- flat.

The He400 really intrigue me. I've been searching for darkish sounding headphones with a touch of upper treble sparkle, but I'm having a hard time finding exactly what I want. The D2000s are nice headphones; they certainly have a little shimmer up top, but the mid-range is way too recessed for my preferences. I also have the HD650; tonally speaking, they give me about 85 percent of what I'm looking for, but the treble is often (uh, how should I put this) lackluster. The DT880 (600ohm version) has a little sparkle up top too, but its midrange is also recessed--moreover, the DT880 lacks bass extension and slam. I even own the HD800, which are amazingly good. But the HD800's sound signature is too neutral, detailed and analytical for casual everyday listening, imho. From all I've read,  the He400 seems to have most of the attributes I desire, but I'm still just a little dubious.  Nevertheless, my check list is all but complete. I have only one burning question: Does the He400 have a more forward mid-range than the D2000 and DT880? Comparisons would be greatly appreciated.

I can compare the HE-400 against the D2000 and HD650 for you.
 
Overall tonally, the HE-400 is darker than HD650 and D2000, I'd rank HD650 brightest, D2000 less bright and HE-400 even less bright.  (All relative to each other, of course-- HD650 is a warm headphone compared to a lot of others)
 
 
HE-400 reminds me a lot of the D2000 from the ground up.  It has a very flat bass and lower mid presentation.  While the D2000's bloated bass can often times make their lower mids too dark in tonality, the HE-400 does not have that problem.  The HD650 has more upper mids than HE-400, however the HE-400 has more than the D2000.  The highly present upper mids of the HD650 and its thinner bass than the D2000/HD650 makes it brighter overall in my book.  The D2000 has the most lower treble which can get harsh at times, the HE-400 has the least amount of lower treble of the bunch, making it a very warm sounding headphone overall.  It's not a serious fault, it just makes it laid-back; its lower treble is still highly detailed.  HE-400 has the most amount of upper treble of the group.  Take a song with lots of information above 10khz, and the HE-400 will truly dazzle, followed by the D2000 then the HD650.
 
Here's my subjective graph of them: 
Green = D2000
Red = HD650
Blue = HE-400

The HE-400 graph looks a bit too recessed in the mids....more like HE-400 with pleather pads.  With velour, I'd flatten those mids out a little more were it my graph.
 

 
It'll be try and see with Valhalla.  On paper an OTL tube amp like Valhalla should be horrible for planars.  But since the HE-400 is a little more efficient than most planars it could still be the exception to the rule.  It's worth a try...but in either case...I see a Lyr in someone's future....with HE-400 and HD650, you just can't not have one....    I'd still get the HE-400 before the Lyr.  Valhalla should be excellent with your HD650 already, and may drive the HE-400 as well.   Your opinion of Valhalla vs Lyr for HD650 would be interesting to a lot of people too if you find out you need one

Do you guys think the Lyr is necessary to bring out the best of the HE-400 or will the Asgard suffice? I was thinking about getting the Lyr and maybe getting a HE-500 or LCD-2 in the future, but after some more consideration, with headphones in the 1k range, I would rather spend the money on camera lens. 
 
I'm actually really happy with what I have at the moment, I just want to try out some ortho phones ;) So the HE-400 with velour pads will most likely (95%) be my last headphone purchase for awhile. (maybe some iem as a portable rig but that's a different story >.< lol)

I don't have an Asgard so I can only say that I think Lyr is excellent with HD650 and HE-400 both, and if you're interested in tube rolling (and since you own a Valhalla it's safe to say you don't mind dealing with tubes) Lyr is a prime choice.  But if you want SS simplicity, hard to go wrong there too.  FWIW, for HD650 Jason at Schiit told me he preferred the Lyr to the Asgard.  And I know I like HE-400 on Lyr.  But I wouldn't say Asgard would be a bad choice, either.  Lyr does tone, power, and dynamics well.  It's not the most detailed amp around (neither is Valhalla) but for HD650 and HE-400 I think it's more than an adequate match.  There's more to power than just volume, it's also how fast it reacts to transients etc.
 
I think overall Lyr is probably more refined than Asgard, at least with decent tubes, but in terms of the ability to run, either will do.  And if you'd rather have SS gear, hard to beat Asgard for the money.  Though I've heard a few people that didn't much like HD650 with Asgard.  It's too warm for them.  But, then, you have Valhalla for HD650....
 

 
Lyr is silent so long as you're not feeding sensitive (Denon, Grado (maybe?), IEMs etc) headphones to it.  Well ok certain tubes may have some hiss, but that's true on a $4000 amp too

Me too! (Or HD650 depending on your personal preferences...)
 

 
Cranking past 12 o'clock on Lyr & Bifrost with HE-400 should be exceedingly rare.  Even with a -15dB digital gain cut in my EQ loop I couldn't actually listen in that position.   That's more where I'd keep it for HE-6!
 

 
12:00 would be in use for HE-6 or for VERY low input sources, IMO....that would be a lot of output into HE-400 from a normal 2v or even 1.8v ipod input.   I can get a "whining" sometimes which can alternately be the result of tubes or a dimmer/coffee maker on elsewhere.  I can get a hiss from tubes.  I can get a hum when up really loud from tubes (without music playing and just cranking the knob to hear humming.)  But serous hum problems almost ALWAYS mean a ground loop issue. I saw one instance of a defective Lyr where something was wrong with the soldering of the IEC power connector on the back that caused a similar ground loop but was indeed an amp problem. 
 

 
It could be a defective amp...it's worth considering...but usually there's a wiring issue.  One thing to try: A two prong "cheater" plug to get rid of the ground pin.  If the hum goes away, you've got a ground loop in circuit somewhere. if it doesn't it's in the amp.

All we know for sure is that there are three different batches of HE400s in terms of driver material; first batch used black plastic, second batch = clear white plastic, and third batch = sandy yellow plastic. Now we know there is a clear transition and improvement of driver assembly going from black to white plastic versions, where they solved the driver cut-out defect. The intrigue at the moment is whether or not the white -> sandy yellow drivers is another revision change, or just a simple change of plastic colour.
 
Personally I've noticed that my new yellow driver pair is noticeably brighter than my previous white driver pair that I returned, and it's not sure if that is simple manufacturing variance or actual re-tuning.
 
Another smaller detail I noticed is that the new yellow driver HE400s have better, more scratch-resistant logo decal.
 
 
Also if you order from head-direct now, you will get the yellow driver version I think.

Yes the MD has the deeper bass. But right now I'm having a little crush on the overall sound signature of the hd650. The sub bass is there with a very tasty texture to it. I need another day of auditioning to get my mind completely around it. 
 
What I'm finding so far is that I'm surprising myself with what I prefer. Reviews and comparisons are great and I've certainly used them along my journey and often very successfully. But I keep thinking about this statement today, "one mans heaven is another man's hell." While you'll read a lot of commentary about the dark nature of the hd650 and how it's problematic for so many, I find that I love the dark signature. It's just pleasing to my ear. What pleases me won't please everyone. I'm also finding that while I used to put a premium on sub bass, it doesn't necessarily get a free pass to the top of the list anymore.  The MDj's  have better impact regarding sub bass, that's not in question to my ears. But then the bass between the he400 and hd650 with a proper amp becomes much more interesting.
 
More to come...

Since we're talking about LD/HE-400 combos...  I am currently rocking a LD1+/RS1i combo that is just superb for a lot of the rock/jazz that I listen to a lot.  But I've been listening to a fair bit more orchestral/classical style stuff lately, and the RS1i doesn't really cut it there.  I listened to my friends foam modded 558 (supposed to sound pretty much like a 598...) and it was nice.  The darker/warmer sound was nice (especially with the tube amp).
 
Been reading a bit about the HD650 and HE-400.  I like what I've read about a fairly similar sound signature with a little more bass on the HE-400 end of things (that bass rumble with some of the orchestral music is what I would really like, without sacrificing too much else for it).  Anyone done the HE-400 and LD1+ combo to comment on it for me?
 
I've heard the RS1i still sounds great with the Lyr, but you know the whole thing with wallets and all.  I'd like to give it a shot with the Little Dot first if it's going to work (then I might decide to upgrade later on... :P)

Well, folks, I've been listening to the He400 for about a week now, attempting to steep myself in their dark but sumptuous sound, and I have to say: these are some genuinely impressive headphones. At first I wasn't so thrilled with them, though; in fact, my first few listening sessions left me somewhat underwhelmed and a little sullen. I guess my expectations were unrealistically high. But crazy expectations are not the whole story here: the he400, to my ears at least, do falter a little. At first, I was only aware of the vaguest of problems, a troubling something I couldn't quite define. But then again, how could I concentrate on anything negative with the he400 seducing me with its incredible bass reproduction.
 
Regarding the bass, let me just say "wow!"  I can't add too much more than that;  the  consensus view is pretty much dead-on. But there was one aspect of the bass that did, in fact, surprise me: the imaging. Many headphones, especially bass-centric headphones, blur the imaging in the bass department, but the he400, somehow, reproduces the entire gamut of bass--drums, cellos, Leonard Cohen's  gravelly voice, etc.--with impeccable clarity, precision and dimensionality. I really think that these headphones (even when subjected to poorly recorded rap or pop music) are incapable of producing an amorphous thud or boom. The only other headphones in my collection capable of this sort of imaging is the HD800.  (The HD800, of course, is the undisputed the champ  of imaging.) 
 
But now back to that subtle but intractable problem I mentioned earlier; it took me a good while to figure it out, but after a few days of extended listening sessions, it finally dawned on me: when it comes to the human voice, the he400's are male-centric headphones. That's to say, they'll reproduce Nick Cave's voice with startling clarity, but not PJ Harvey's. Indeed, female voices often sound veiled and sometimes even a little nasally. Once I realized this, I almost returned these headphones to the retailer. Out of sheer curiosity, however, I decided to pull out my old Behringer 10 band graphic equalizer. Equalizers, I know, are generally  frowned upon; moreover, I've never satisfactorily eq'd any of my headphones before. Such fiddling usually injects an artificial something into the sound, so as a rule, I don't use eqs.  But a modest 3db boost between 1khz and 6khz worked magic with the he400. I'm not kidding. Now, with the help of Lisa Gerrard, these headphones are singing angelically to me.  I am very happy indeed.

I mean, I believe you when you say your pair has slightly more treble. However, this is possibly just headphone by headphone differences, and not because the sound dramatically changed on the R3, if at all. Still, with your statement, you've caused all these newcomers who've never heard an HE400 prior to jump in, fully expecting harsh treble based on your comments. The R2 already had a pretty strong treble emphasis in certain ranges, which can get harsh with certain songs and equipment (the HE400 sounds much better off the NFB5 than the E17, due to the smoother, warmer, more full bodied tone of the NFB5, where the E17 has a fatiguing treble in comparison, until you use the treble reduction).
They have nothing to compare it to, but already calling the R3 inferior compared to R2, which they've never heard. It's beyond stupid to me. The treble was already an issue on the R2s for some users, leading me to believe the R3 more than likely has the same sound, other than your opinion on them.
It just aggravates me that people write off something based on very few legitimate opinions. It's the K701 vs Q701 all over again. That is a very long debate... one that actually has many legit comparisons, and not this he said, she said BS.
I wish I could get an R3. Unlike the bandwagon, I fully expect them to sound 99.9% the same. That .1% difference between human error and not some intentional mild treble bump. Anyone wanna trade me for my R2 for a few weeks, let me know. That way this absolute idiocy can be done with.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 10/5/12 at 10:08am

Here's l96North's account of a direct comparison between his r2 and his friend's new r3 headphones, that he PM'd me when we were talking about this:
 
"Just wanted to tell you my brief experience with the v3 drivers was that its piercing treble high end made alot of recordings to ME and MY BUDDY who had the v3 Very tisssy sounding or siblant.
Only a few minutes of listening with v3 i started to become ear fatigued along wirh my buddy noticing the same also. I nor he could not take the added higher end. Pretty much we tried my pads a few of my moded ones n tricks but in the end he had the set for two days then returned them.He asked me what did they change I replied I dunno but they should change it back.V2 and v3 are like TO ME "an opinion",not even close to being the same. Not saying that's bad or good just different for being the same headphone model HE-400
A big sound signature deviation from older revisions."
 
I think he's the only one to have directly compared the two revisions.

I have nothing to compare to (except ie-80 iems) and got mine he-400 today. I am happy to trade with you for few weeks. I am in UK though, so shipping costs may be slightly higher, ok with me.
I think the more experienced head-fiers have a chance to listen to both of them the better :)
 
I wonder if i would hear the difference between the 2, and if yes - which one I would actually prefer.
But this are the first set of big headphones for me, I've spent way too much of my time trying to decide what to get as these are not cheap. I based my choice on my prefered sound signature and opinion of experts from this forum. Now I am just afraid that I didn't get exactly what I decided to pay for. As I said these is first pair of big headphones for me, and these are very different to iem-s, so I didn't know what to expect. 
 
My ie-80 seem darker in first impressions, but from buying iems i know i personally need to burn-in. I didn't like sm3 when I got them but they grew on me, didn't like senn ie-80 either, now they are my fav, so I know I need some hours before knowing what i think about the sound :)
 
Oh, I drive them with E17.

Exactly! 
That is pretty much all I'd ever want out of a headphone, in terms of bass and overall tone. I just didn't wanna have to rely on the E17 to make the HE400 sound that way. I can basically make the DT990/32 sound to my preference (albeit with the lack planar magic) with just a -2 treble hit, though I don't even bother as the treble doesn't bother me un-EQ'd the way it did on the HE400.
In other news:
Just boxed up the HE400 to send it out tomorrow to the new owner. I didn't wanna listen to them anymore. I haven't listened to them in a few days (work days tend to not give me time to sit back and use my cans), and I think that was a smart move. I KNOW I'd regret it if I did. Rip it off like a band aid, I say. XD
That HE400 sound was intoxicating, but I feel it best to downgrade to something more fun overall, even if I lose out on that lovely warmth, natural, full bodied sound. Didn't wanna constantly have to bass boost the HE400 to give it the fun bass presence I wanted for gaming and music. I know the DT990/32 will serve me well, and the KSC35 is right there when I want some warmth and richer mids.
I see the KSC35 as a budget HE-400 with a mid bass boost, and better treble balance. I love them so much.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 10/7/12 at 8:01am

Going by K702, I think that description would be very misleading to anyone that has heard AKG 70x but not heard HE-400...so possibly a poor analogy. 
 
K70x is not without flaws, but I think that greatly undersells the AKGs.  They're excellent headphones, technically on par with HD650 & HE-400 IMO.  I tend to prefer them less, but that doesn't mean they're not equals.  The soundstage of the AKGs is immense, but overstated.  And the detail/accuracy is excellent.  Where it falls apart is bass presentation and an arbitrarily shrill upper treble.  And arguably uninvolving mids, but that's preference, and I tend to be surprised by them every time I pick them up in terms of how much I don't hate them despite expectation bias. 
 
Both are highly detailed, however instrument separation and bass performance is clearly in favor of HE-400 as well as warmth and fullness of vocals.  I think your original comparison plays too much on the common misconception about "K70x has too huge a soundstage."  While it's true it's very wide, I think people are struck by the poor center image focus and feel it's artificial.  HE-400 (and HE-6 for that matter) also lack a strongly coherent center image focus so it's sort of apples to apples.  They just have a wider swing forward and behind the ear than does K70x. 
 
Also I think the early HE-400 reputation for small soundstage was based on the pleather pads.  With velour pads the soundstage opens up nicely to a fair size. We're not talking K70x or HE-6, but HD650, Dx000, certainly.

I can understand the frustration in the bit of extra time involved with waiting on this part of the process.  I've been in that position before.  However, we're talking 30 miles in New York city traffic @ twice per week.  It's not like a ride out on the open road, where one can't accomplish the task in 25 minutes (each way).  
 
 

 
Again, we're talking about New York city.  Moving closer to work by 30 miles might mean having a house that costs $550,00 vs. buying an apartment or co-op near work that could cost near $1,000,000.
 
Now, I'm not trying to make up excuses for HifiMAN, but just trying to add a bit of perspective into the situation.  I do hope everyone gets their headphones in a timely manner.  Yet, more than a few of us have realized it is about a 3-week process.  However, once the headphones get sent from Hong Kong, the trip is pretty quick.  Once they go through Alaska (mine did), I had them within two days.

Cool.  Now you've identified the problem, fix it.
I'm as bad as anyone for impatient frothing, but customers are (as a rule) entitled enough and there seems to be a big attitude of "given an inch, taking a mile" when it comes to service.  Unexpected things happen, especially with new companies and products, and good service isn't bending over backwards because they owe you every second of lost time; it's communicating effectively, processing your issue and fixing the issue in a timely manner, which they've gotten two out of three on already (fingers crossed for the third)
Consider that a lot of mobs wouldn't offer a "live" service rep and would likely not deign to tell you what they were going to do and when, and that if you complained about delays, would simply feed you a line about "postal service delays".
 
I guess where I'm really coming from is that I see a relatively young company doing a LOT of things right, even when issues arise, and I think it's important to realise that while it would be nice for all problems to fall on their doorstep, sometimes customers simply have to accept a little bad luck occasionally. (I giggled a little at the Schiit Happens logo below the post window... oddly appropriate)

I'm such a knucklehead. For the last two weeks, I've been enjoying my he400s, smug in the knowledge that I knew exactly what these headphones were capable of. Boy, was I ever wrong. I had no idea whatsoever what these bad boys were capable of, until, quite on impulse,  I pulled out an old Kenwood receiver that my brother gave me approximately 20years ago. There it was, in my closet, swathed and cradled by a sleeping bad--dusty, neglected, and all but forgotten. Long story short, that receiver has just improved the he400's bass response two fold. Don't get me wrong: the bass sounded absolutely fantastic  before, but now, well, it sounds out of this word! I can't believe the impact! I just can't. I would swear, under the penalty of death, that the bass now has more impact than my D2000s, while, of course, retaining all of its characteristic texture and tightness. I really had no idea that bass could sound so punchy, so deep and so controlled--all at the same time!  Of course, being who I am, this discovery only makes me more curious about the he500. And that's just because, when you get right down to it, I'm somewhat of a  "vocal-fiend" (to coin a really stupid word). I just  love slightly forward vocals, and the he400 still leaves me  wanting more from the ladies (and this is my only complaint with these headphones.) If I'm not mistaken, I think the he500 excels with vocals of both genders. Boy, the more I think about it, the more certain I become: I should own both of those headphones.

Sounds like a good HE-6 amp to me!   200W @8ohm = something like 25w @50ohm....so you'd get to use 1/4 the volume dial...maybe. :)   Yep, they're definitely "flagship zone" and the big turnoff for folks is that receivers and power amps is the norm...very few headphone amps run them   Not many people want to run a 20lb 17x5x14" "headphone amp."  Since you're already doing it, I figured I'd toss it out there.  HD800 should sound great on that receiver's headphone jack as well though!  No need to go crazy on it.  It sounds great out of my integrated's HP out, but I have other noise/gain issues going on there.  HD800 is a lot more sensitive than HE-400, but it also has a lot higher impedance so the difference isn't as extreme as it appears.
 
Of course there's better than that receiver....but I bet the receiver's better than the LD in almost every way but the tubes!
 

 
He said it had enough power for HD800, he didn't say that it had the best distortion, noise, and speed characteristics to sound good with HD800    That said, my personal feeling is out of the box, HD800 is deplorable sounding, and it positively needs to be EQ'd.  But if EQ'd it can sound quite nice even on modest equipment like HP jacks on receivers like yours, or Lyr, etc.   But it's not nearly as "plug & play" as something like HE-400 is that just sounds good without effort

Hmm, you're not far off with Behringer.  I'm using the DEQ2496....digital EQ, all the controls you could want.  Some would argue it's not perfect....but IMO it's as transparent as I need it to be with some highly transparent gear.  Complicated piece of gear compared to an analog GEQ of course....but once you take your time to learn it it's easy to use.
 
What are you using for source?  Assuming you have a seperate transport and DAC, the DEQ goes before the DAC via optical or AES, not after it.  You can use it analog via XLR or XLR->RCA cables (it auto switches the voltage), but as an audiophile introducing an A/D->D/A stage again is unacceptable 
 
If you're bent on analog, something like a BBE is probably preferable to Behringer and not much more money.  Though I hate 31-band stereo GEQ's...they're enormous in most cases.  15 band gives a little more control, but 31 band spoils you once you're used to it 
 
Of course if you're using PC as a source, it's kind of a mute point since that's already a digital EQ!

Well most think of instrumental separation and soundstage as two separate things. Soundstage is a little ambiguous, but I think of it as the size of the sound. 
 
For instrumental separation, HE-400 is an excellent choice. It's a very quick headphone. Absolutely amazing for jazz and oldies style rock, as well as jam style rock. For rock that consists of walls of sound from distorted guitars, I wasn't initially wowed but I feel like upgrading from the STX to the Asgard helped with it a ton. Not sure how the e11 compares to the Asgard in this aspect. It's really a great all around headphone though, it works with every genre!
 
Soundstage is also very good, it will be a definite improvement going from a closed headphone to this.
 
One thing to consider though: you said you like to listen to it in coffee shops and such.... Everyone will be able to hear what you are listening to, and you will be able to hear stuff around you. No isolation and near 100% sound leakage.

The short answer imho is: yes, most definitely! The he400 will give you a genuine taste of high-fidelity (many other headphones at this price point fall far short of the he400's stellar performance). But that's just my opinion and it comes with a big caveat. So many people, you see, have asked that very question--Is headphone X the best headphone at this or that particular price point?  But no one can credibly answer such a question. Another, more accurate way of wording this question might be: will I enjoy these headphones more than other headphones of a similar price?  And that, of course, is a question only you can answer for yourself. Now, don't get me wrong: the good folks at Head-Fi love to give advice (they are an exceedingly helpful and solicitous lot) but you need to ask the right questions, if you want satisfaction. So let me ask you a few questions: do you like darkish sounding headphones with a touch of mid-treble brightness? Do you love deep but tightly controlled bass? Do you prefer a moderate sized sound-stage with holographic imaging? Do you really like to hear the texture in male voices? If you answered "yes" to all of these questions then, I'm pretty darned sure: these are the headphones for you. But if you prefer a "brighter" sound or a so-called "fun" sound signature (think Beyerdynamic or Grado headphones); or if you want a pair of dead neutral headphones with a super wide sound-stage (think AKG 701); or if you want monster bass (think Denon Dxxx not Beats!), or if you want extra mid-bass accompanied by a lush midrange (think Audio Technica esw9)--then the he400 may not be the best headphones for you. I think that's where you need to start your headphone search though: with your own preferences.  Once you've nailed down all your likes and dislikes, then you have a very good chance of finding the headphones that will suit you best.

Mine just left Tennessee, heading straight to Canada at the moment...I'm definitely getting em tomorrow then :) it was still in Hongkong just early yesterday so it's quite fast (esp as you are in the States so it's another like 10 hours off the total transit time).
 
 
 
 
 
 



I posted about this some time ago back when I was trying to "fix" the treble issue with the rev3 driver. Basically I ripped out these thin acoustic felt foams off of M50 earpads, and just stuck them onto the drivers, the side facing the ears. It sort of diffused the overall sound, made the sound signature softer, more mellow and helped with that treble, but it also made the bass a bit more organic and solid. It instantly reminded me of how the Audezes sounded like.
 
Seriously though if you look at LCD2s, you can indeed see very liberal use of felt / foam in acoustically damping the drivers. Maybe that's the main reason why they sound so different from Hifiman planars.
 

 
Edit: either I never noticed or did no one ever try their Audezes without all that foam?

Well, almost a hour into this, and I think it's safe to say that the soundstage has definitely become narrower with the felt mod. And while the level of perceived detail has become better as a result, you lose a lot of the quickness of note, and tracks can get a bit messier and looser in the end. What was most intriguing was how the sub bass became more pronounced, although this could just be an artifact from the more closed sound. This is definitely a noticeable difference though. In short, yes they gain attributes similar to that of the LCD-2s, but simply lack the lushness to pull that sort of sound off. I'm not really liking the end result with these, as I prefer the larger, more immersing stock sound, so I took them out. Strangely, they didn't seem to change the treble, only the soundstage and bass was affected in the end.
 
The grills on the HiFiMANs are markedly different from the LCD-2s, which are in essence, open slits after you take the foam out. While the Audeze's may benefit more from this sort of damping, I really think the HE-400s like their backs to be completely open.  I tried listening to these without the grills at all, and wow, really airy sound, without losing much coherency. Wondering how a more open grill, along with a thinner piece of felt on the side of the driver facing the ear would sound like.

Ok, so i recently acquired the HE400.
I think these sound very very similar to LCD2 but i have issues with following :
 
> The upper mids are bit nasally . They do not have a solid pivoted feeling to them. There is much air & very less concentration. The amplitude of some vocals & instruments falling in this region is too low

Now, although the LCD2 are no mid range king but at least they have a weight behind their midrange.

Do all of you have similar discs with you pads?
 
 

 
 
The positive things :
 
> The bass is very clean , linear & very good extension. The LCD 2 bass may not be as clear but hits little harder. The HE400 bass can said as grand while LCD2 has more solid bass.
 
> The soundstage is quite good. Its equally distributed in width & depth
 
> While the LCD2 may sound bit stagnant , the HE400 is more lively
 
Now the question to all HE400 owners is:
 
Would using the Velour pads positively affect Mid range?? Will it be able to sort out the mid range issues i mentioned previously ?
 
Thanks for reading.

In my experience, the velour pads changed the sound very little--so little in fact, I'm not sure I could pass an abx test comparing the velor and pleather pads. I also complained about this "nasally" upper-midrange, and I'm happy to report that after much burn-in (driver or brain burn-in, take your pick), and swapping my little dot mkiii for a much more powerful vintage receiver, one that gives me plenty of headroom, I'm no longer aware of this problem at all--at least while listening to music. (it's a different  story  while watching movies though). Also, vocals--especially male vocals--have become unbelievably textured and "real" sounding to me (the best I've ever heard--better than my hd800!), and the mid-range seems way more "focused" now with more body to boot. Give these bad boys time and power and they will no doubt improve. Oh, one question: which headphone is darker sounding, the lcd2 or the he400?

Thanks much for confirming. Yeah a particular upper mids band is definitely low amplitude. So much so that equalizing the 3.5k & 5k band does not affect much, rather makes it even worse.
Now i am definitely not looking for level upper mids but at least should have better foundation (call it body to the mids).
But your assesment with velour gives some hope.

 
Gotcha guys. Time to go Velour.
My statements made the HE400 mids look very bad but all that was comparatively. There are much worse mids around (Denon D2k).
 
* My Yamaha HP50A Orthos (Modded by Gurubhai) have mids so hypnotic, real & emotional that no LCD 2 , HE400 or any vintage ortho comes close. Not even 10 mile range. 
* Those who adore hard hitting LCD2 lows must hear the NAD RP18. They have the sub bass slam that can put LCD 2 to shame.

Hmmmm....lets see how it goes with the velour pads & my ears.

Following are the most prominent diff. b/w HE400 & LCD2
 
>HE400 has bigger mid bass. LCD2 hits harder in Sub bass. That 10-15HZ extension diff from frequency graph is BS in real world . Its just that LCD2 hits 30-40HZ harder than 50-100HZ. HE400 hits uniform. The extension is nothing to compare about here.
 
>LCD 2 definitely has better bodied mids (lower, upper , age 13,14.....i mean the entire range; provided HE400 on pleathers & rejected by many). The resolution & definition is comparable.
 
>The highs are sharp , very airy on HE400 but there is a very prominent peak in the highs that makes the entire treble lack linearity. The LCD2 has sweeter highs, very sweet in fact but is so low in amplitude that you desire for more. These definitely have little better resolution & can take 2-3 db +eq. without loosing the resolution. 
>HE400 has even soundstage. The LCD2 has ss that is like a mile in depth & no suitable width to complement. This ss when accompanied with low treble output results in somewhat stagnant sound. 
 
Overall, the LCD2 still has upper hand in grandness, texture & linearity of instruments & mids. The bass is very much equal quality/clean only differing slightly in presentation
 
Is the LCD2  2.5x better than HE400? We still do not have a formula here.

Hi all. New to the Forum.
 
Went crazy today and dropped $400 bucks on the HE-400s and some velour pads (just in case, but I don't really like leather either). Its mostly this forums fault, so I came here to post!
The comments and reviews on these phones have been great, but I am already getting buyers remorse and I haven't even heard them yet. Please help me! 
 
I've slowly made my way up from a pay of Sony in-ear LP85s (somewhat pricey), to some Sennheiser HD 425s, and finally the HD 595s which I have used and loved for over 3 years. The 595s have been awesome, always very comfortable, and generally with good to very good sound at whatever volume. General laid-back-ness of Sennheiser has been great in terms of all-day listening comfort, but occasionally has left me wanting more - a lot more. The 425s had a nice bass response (especially for DVD watching), but were always "thick" - the mid and high end always seemed to be stuck under glue. The Sony's are pretty uncomfortable for long listening, but have great resolution if a somewhat "grating" response for what they are, which are my low-key portables. I'll probably keep all of these headphones but figured it was time to switch brands to get a totally different (and hopefully better) sound.
 
I was close to pulling the trigger on some Beyer 32 Ohms (880 or 990) before I stumbled onto the Hifimans. Considering what else is available at about $400 bucks, I figured, why not. I have heard some planar uprights before, and they were quite amazing. A flat response has gotten more important over time, I am not a bass head, but bass is meant to be heard just as a cymbal is (and according to my sennheisers, cymbals are supposed to be barely there). But boy this is a big chunk of change, biggest one on a single piece of audio equipment yet. Because I listen to music sometimes all day long (I do a lot of research), one of my biggest concerns are comfort. The second is that these better kick the crap out of my 595s! Can anyone comment on that?
 
Otherwise, does anyone have experience with Hifiman returns? I believe it was a 30 day satisfaction guarantee?
 
When the babies show up I'll try to remember to come back and add a full review.

I have had the Senns 595's for about two years.  I think you will be amazed with the HE400's.   The Senns 595's sound flat to me in comparison to the HE400's.  The Senns are comfortable but I don't find the HE400's uncomfortable either. I am planning on ordering the velour pads as others are saying they are more comfortable and set up a better sound.  I like to compare the two headphones on the same equipment, same songs, and same setup.  The HE400's blow the 595's out of the water.  The bass on the 400's hit a depth the 595's can't touch. The 400's create a 3D sound effect.  They seemingly separate and individuate the sound off each ear piece.  I am hearing new sounds off songs I am already familiar with.  For instance I could make out all the words at the end of the Beatles Strawberry Fields.  I'll be interested to see your take on the 400's when you get them.

Thanks RushNerd. These decisions wouldn't be so excruciating if it were easier to just go somewhere and demo the hell out of everything. But where I live, you can't find anything locally that doesn't come from Sony or Dr. Dre. Hopefully, we'll have a line by Snoop Dogg and Kim Kardashian soon!
 
No Amp yet. My Realtek "HD" (don't judge it too fast) audio on my 2011 comp is 24-bit 96 khz capable but like everyone else I am typically limited to old-fashioned 16 bit 44.1. The music DVDs I've heard so far are just incredible though - makes you wish CDs would die and DVD or Bluray Audio would take over. The comp has dedicated Headphone amplification, and the 595s, being a little higher impedance, don't get hardly 10% of the volume available most days. 50% is enough to make my ears hurt in 10 minutes. So I am going to try it with the new phones and see what happens. I want to listen for a lifetime, so I only want to really crank it up once in awhile. Anyway, I am too budgeted for true high end gear, but in car audio, some home audio, etc., I've learned a lot about what features, brands, and specs seem to count. If you've ever used time alignment in a car stereo to move the image right to your dome, you know the kind of difference I am talking about. I usually fun Foobar / WASAPI with lossless or 320 Mp3s and a 24-bit 44.1 fixed audio rate. Once you get a more direct path going, I have found that the realtek audio quality is way smoother than the crap X-Fi soundcard I used to rock.
 
If the things really soak up the power or sound like crap, I'd love to try Creek Audio, Schiit, or possibly a Fiio. No vacuum tubes for me though, don't want to deal with them. My knock against the first two are their "old fashioned-ness". It would be nice if they would take a line in via USB or 3.5mm since my listening life and computer life are one. My knock against fiio is mainly I am not sure they would provide an appreciable difference over my current setup, whether in terms of capability or power. Then again, if there is a real kick ass DAC/Amp combo out there for about $200 bucks or so I am all ears.

"I have had the Senns 595's for about two years.  I think you will be amazed with the HE400's."
 
That's the sort of stuff I need to hear lol!
 
I agree that the Senns are a little on the "flat" side - from almost day one I've given them a little bass tweaking from a 31 band EQ in Foobar. Not that it makes a huge difference, but I feel better. These things really don't like to be pushed too much on the bass side - they get muffled sounded fairly easily. Something in the mid-range treble has always been on the "recessed side", yet at higher volumes they can be a tad grainy. But they are on the friendlier side of bright and have generally handled what I throw at them.
 
I can say that, with 3 years of listening on these, I've covered my old and new songs probably at least 50 times over. I have soundtracks, heavy metal, jazz, blues, R&B, Pop, Indie, you-name-it (just no country). The Senns never really let me down sans heavier bass content - some electronic and rap type music is just lost on these, they either can't hit the note, or they lack some oomph. On the other hand, nothing really stands out either. Can't say that about the 428s. The clear experience to have was gaming / movies. The added dynamic resolution or exaggerated effects were always fun to listen to on those. They sounded like they had tiny subwoofers working. But musically, "thick" and "veiled" comes to mind. The 595s were just better at everything, they just don't really stand out anywhere in particular. So polite, those Germans.
 
I am already getting a track listing going in my mind. I'll be watching a movie, spin some old discs and some new ones. In about a week! Doh!

Just wanted to reinforce what others have already said: the he400s are far superior to the hd595s--so rest easy. I owned the 595s for over 5 years, and anyway you slice it, the he400 is the better can. I owned the dt880s (600ohm version) for 2 years, and, once again, I have no doubts. I'd like to mention only one caveat though: the he400's sound-signature. The he400 is a much darker sounding can than what you may be accustomed to; the 595's are semi-neutral and definitely mid-centric headphones. So don't let this surprise you too much. That aside, expect a colossal improvement in bass response; the 595's bass, by comparison, is downright anemic (If my memory serves me right, I really don't think the 595s had any appreciable sub-bass whatsoever). It's no exaggeration for me to say: the he400 may just have the deepest, most controlled, most articulate, and thus (for me at least) the most enjoyable bass, I've ever had the privilege of hearing with headphones.

Thanks Madmollusk -
 
If by "dark" you mean, "not bright", this was one of my concerns going in. I originally sprang for the 595s because they were often described as a tad more "aggressive" for Sennheiser. I would consider them "bright" if they had more of a treble pop in the upper reaches, but they don't. They stand out more, as you point out, in the mid-range. Yet I've owned speakers that were very bright in the past, and jeez, that can get real old - even if my memory says that made them great for rock and metal. So again the trade-off is sound quality versus longer-term listening comfort. I guess I'll just have to see. The 595 was a revelation compared to the 428, even despite the obvious-at-the-time differences. If you also owned 595s, your opinion is gold to me.
 
Based on freq charts, the 400s look flat 10 all the way to the 1 kHz bump, with a recessed upper midrange, and then quite a bit of treble up top. It cuts a strange line, in other words. Why this gets compared to JBL is beyond me. I've owned Studio Series JBLs for years and find them, for lack of a better word, to be quite controlled. They have a really narrow sweet spot, but when you are in it, man, the mid-range is awesome. Airy, and just full of space and realism. The bass has a nice quality, but hardly much of a sub-kick. With a great sub woofer they really kick ass. But at very high volumes they can sound a bit compressed, or get overly "forward". The treble performance is good, but I would claim a bit flatter sounding, and capable of seeming harsh. The narrow sweet spot makes them less fun for music. On the other hand, there is nothing else I'd rather have for movie night.
 
I am ready for a change, so I am sure the new sound signature startling, but hopefully welcome. If by "JBL" we are talking some space, air, and ease of isolating musical elements, then hell yes. Frankly this is partly about trying out planar tech also. Any audio equipment I use tends to have to be a jack of all trades, and I have a good feeling about these cans. Hopefully the darkness won't affect rock music and electric genres which typically can sound a little better with some aggression in the signature.

Hm, I'd say (at least the newer HE400s e.g. the one I just received earlier today) the HE400s are laidback but fairly bright up top. If that is dark then the term 'dark' is too confusing for me to use. Basically this creates an effect where not everything is "in-your-face" so there's a greater sense of layering and depth, but sometimes music might not be as engaging as you'd like.
 
The treble might even be a bit "bite-y" at times, although nothing bad unless the music is extremely treble-centric by itself.
 
 
 
Overall this sounds great with electronic music (which focuses more on lower~mid mids), but not as great with rock music (which is more mid-upper mids). In this case I mean purely in terms of voicing synergy, not in terms of technicalities like extension separation and all that jazz, those the HE400s excel at.
 
 
For entertainment where the audio is more focused on spatial cues and immersion, such as movies and games, these probably do better than most headphones.

I ordered my velours from head direct - only $10 bucks. Maybe there is a difference in the shipping cost.
 
I wanted to reply to the "darkness thing" again. I think tamer upper mids are usually a good thing, since those are the frequencies which usually grate on me the most. In my car, I tend to get a lot of sibilance in the mid range, so I had to cut it down - knocking out 1 khz range by several dbs had the side effect of giving a better sub-mid blend. Then I went after frequencies under 10 kHz looking for another peak that is there, but I can't really do anything about it (EQ limitations). So on some recordings, the peak is just there hitting over and over again, and ultimately, you just don't really enjoy the song like you could. Going from senns to car and back is often an exercise in realizing my car's bass is way more fun and very detailed, while my treble is neutral but harsh at points with less overall resolution (that you can hear while moving anyway). Car audio is almost always about taming your tweeters, so I think a somewhat recessed performance in that area is smart. Sounds to me like these cans will tame some of the upper mids while trying to give stuff like cymbals an appropriate impact and metallic sound.
 
Has anyone tried running straight up Piano through their HE-400s to look for rough spots in response? It would be interesting if the right recording revealed some brightness in the upper deck, recession in the mids, and probably liquid sunshine in the freqs 1khz and below.

In brief, I would say that the he400 is tuned to stress harmonics in the mid-treble without creating a fatiguing or bright sound. Some Beyer and Shure headphones seem to stress certain frequencies that I would consider "hot' or "zazzy." The Akg k550 comes to mind--an otherwise great pair of headphones ruined by too much treble energy. Now, some folks might be sensitive to the He400's 10khz spike. Indeed, I consider myself borderline sensitive and once in awhile, almost exclusively while listening to poorly recorded or badly mastered music, the he400 will make me wince; this, however,never happened with the hd595, which, if anything, has slightly rolled off highs. That said, if you're not sensitive to treble in the aforementioned frequency range, or if you don't own a bunch of sub-par recordings, then the he400's treble response shouldn't bother you. The he-400's upper midrange recession might be more of an issue, actually; it seems to impact female voices in a negative way sometimes, especially when watching movies, but presumably the velour pads will help resolve this problem. I should stress, however, that I mostly complained about this female voice "problem" early on, before burning these bad boys in, but now I don't consider this much of an issue anymore; actually, I'm inclined to think that the upper-midrange recession might just be one of the reasons why male voices and everything down low sounds so positively layered and amazing!

Definitely gonna burn these in tomorrow on my E17 with some pink noise (don't wanna use up 10 hours of tubes!) and see if they sound even better afterwards. I think they just need to break in a little bit. The bass could be a little better. Damn they're detailed though, definitely noticeable compared to the HD600. Instrument separation is fantastic, as well as positioning/soundstage. Despite them having a "dark" sound signature I find they still have quite a bit of treble. And yeah mine have the translucent white drivers like everyone else's replacements.
 
They sound great, though. Much more engaging than the HD600s. I don't mean to talk **** about them, they really are good headphones, better at some things than the HE400s, but these have such an edge with electronic music it's not even funny. The bass is ridiculous and there's tons of detail without having fatiguing treble. I love the feeling of notes going into my ears, like low bass/oscillations that I can feel almost tickling my ear. It feels like the sound is layered, whereas with the HD600 it's a bit more of a wall of sound. Both have their better applications.

The HE-400 is quite different in signature than the other orthos I've tried. I haven't tried them all but the majority of the non vintage orthos such as LCD2/3, HE-4, HE500, HE6 and the T50RP. The closest was when I  modded the T50RP but those are still quite different due to closed. It has good extension like all the orthos I've tried but with this signature it's hard to compare to the other headphones I have. 
 
I expected these to be something like the D7k but in open and ortho form but not quite. A bit more enjoyable for me and less colored than the D7k but still colored. It's too bad I no longer own the V200 amp. I suspect that would have been a good pairing. I'm using the Mjolnir amp on these and so far so good. I don't have anything SE except the D1 headphone out which is no slouch. I'll try those eventually.

So I've read everything there is to read about these cans (quite the drama I have to say) and I'm more confused now than when I started reading. I'm trying to decide between these and the hd 650s. I've owned the 650s before so I know what to expect and honestly they are really great for me but I like hifiman and I would loooooove better bass than 650 offers but wouldn't want to sacrifice too much mid. Also I don't want a bright high end which is what drew me to the 400s in the first place. They were originally described as darker than the 650s with better bass which would be perfect! But with all the revisions I'm not really sure what to make of these. Seems like they are refined D2000s? I guess I'm trying to figure out how the mids and highs sound on these! A recessed upper mid doesn't seem great but are the mids overall recessed? Detailed life like vocals are a deal breaker for me, are these the right cans? So confused.

From a neutrality standpoint, 650 is less colored and more flat.  I dare say the HD650 would be dead flat if it weren't for sub-bass rolloff and a lack of airiness above 12khz.
 
Try not to confuse laid-back with recessed, at least not recessed used in the head-fi sense, whose definition is more along the lines of masked.  HE-400's upper mids are laid-back in the sense that they take a step back in the picture, but still show through with full detail.  D2000's upper mids are recessed in the sense that they take a step back in the picture and are masked by bass and treble, therefore losing detail.
 
The bass of the HE-400 isn't basshead level, but it still makes the HE-400 very thick sounding, along with full-bodied lower mids.
 
I think the HE-400 is more detailed and has better instrument separation than the HD650, but HD650 has a smoother midrange with less congestion, and in comparison, its more forward upper mids work well for rock with electric guitar etc.

Ill be using a vintage sansui 3030 receiver for my amp and a Pure i20 for a dac. Neve owned a proper headamp (not true, owned the kicas for a minute, had issues with it compared to the receiver with 650s) ... The problem is ultimately I want something like the LCD for which I'd go all out on a head amp but that's years away so in the meantime I can't drop money on an amp. I'm really leaning towards the 400, granted this is the thread for them so it's like I wanted to be convinced LOL but I can't forget when I first heard 650 I was shocked to find so little bass .... Of course th mids took over eventually but I'm kind of a basshead have always used bass heavy phones so I'm never fully satisfied without that fully fleshed out foundation. I've used m50 d2000 ie8 s4 and bcuase of these I'm actually sick of bass because they all go over the top and ruin my mids. The more I listen to music critically the I realize the importance of midrange but it sounds like 400 doesn't really sacrifice midrange it's just not the focus? If that's the case fine.

To the persons freaking out about the HD 650 / Hifiman decision.
 
I went Hifiman because I really wanted to take a chance on switching brands. That's pretty much it. Having owned Sennheisers, I know they are comfortable as heck, decent looking, and easy to listen to all day long. They wouldn't be easy to listen to all day if they weren't light, comfortable, and "laid-back" sounding. This is also why, if I wasn't used listening to music for hours at a time, I wouldn't necessarily recommend them. The politeness is not always an asset listening to say, metal at high volumes.
 
If you only listen to music in short spurts, say, to check out the new CD you bought, I would likely recommend switching to other brands which are more aggressive sounding, or brighter (depending on your fave genres anyway). Shorter bursts of listening make anyone more forgiving of a given sound of headphone. Its when you are listening for hours, moving in and out of different genres, that a "sound signature" becomes more apparent, as do any weaknesses. For example, the hi-end of my HD 595s is so noticeably absent at times, it is almost annoying. The bass can come across as a little thin, and I have to concentrate to enjoy it. Yet these same shortcomings are partly how I know I can stand to listen to them for hours.
 
Humans are naturally sensitive to mid-range frequencies, and get more "deaf" the farther you move into low or high frequency ranges. We are the same with light - we only perceive a limited spectrum, and experience "brightness" more acutely toward yellow tones. So in fact many speakers / headphones which don't overemphasize bass and treble relative to mids to some degree can seem pretty "thin" and boring.
 
When I get my hifimans I'll post a review. Until that time, I would have no problem recommending sennheiser if you want an awesome set of cans that you can listen to all day, and are guaranteed to treat many genres well.

Lurker here for years, so hi.  =D  I've used an Audio Technica ATH-A900 closed back set for years, they finally started to have some serious issues so I splurged on a HE-400 and a Fiio E17 amp.
 
I just got this 2 days ago and it's using the Rev 2 drivers (according to pictures posted here).  The Fiio E17 can drive these pretty well, I'm using Gain +6 and Bass +4 (I know it's coloring the sound, I might reduce this.  Do NOT look at this # and say these headphones lack bass, they totally do not).
 
I listen to alot of different types of music, but mostly lean towards the rock/indie side.  There was quite the smile on my face when I first plugged these in and started listening to some music.  The bass is deep, defined, and quick.  The mids are pretty well represented and defined (notice a trend?).  The treble is so clear, cymbals sound like they should unlike alot of other headphones I've listened to over the years.  I'm definitely a planar convert now.  I've used them a little with gaming and the imaging is way better than my other headphones (closed back so of course).  I am noticing a tiny bit of fatigue with the headphones however, it seems to be on the treble side.  I am using velour pads (ripped off those pleather ones immediately).  I'm not sure if it's just my ears getting used to these or not, we'll see.
 
I also have tried these into a Pod HD-300 for some guitar recording.  I'll definitely have to reset up some of the patches on here.  One patch in particular - I've gotten so used to how the A900s sound with it, and when I put it thru the HE-400, it was quite the eye opener.  It actually sounded great, but totally not what I was expecting.  I just don't think the A900s could accurately show what was coming out of this setup, and the HE-400s are showing me what this can do in a new light.

For the guy who said I'd be wrecking the DT990 pads -- I plan on disassembling my pleather pads and gluing the DT990 pads on there. Quite a few people have modded their HE400s here: http://www.head-fi.org/t/572327/mission-replace-the-hifiman-ear-pads-with-other-brand-ear-pads
 
I called Sennheiser and they do have HD650 replacement headband cushions for sale, $9, but they're backordered right now. I figured I'd just get the HD600 cushion. I'm gonna take the one out of my HD600s now and see how it works with these.
 
Edit: It ain't pretty, but it works!!! Definitely gonna use command strips when I get the replacement cushion, but this is pretty nifty. Only downside is now with the cups fully extended, the bottoms rest on my earlobes. Not a big deal though. I can push down on the headband and compress the cushion a bit, then they go past my earlobes and stay there, snugly. I bet with DT990 pads these would be pure win.

Hah... basshead?  My first love are the Ety ER4s, and my other IEMs are UM3Xs, which I find have almost too much bass.  I find that the HE-400s have markedly less bass than the UM3Xs (is it fair to compare IEMs to cans?).
 
As for amping, I'm using an iBasso D-Zero, which is rated at 95mW into 32ohm.  I don't know how that compares to other amps, but given that it's $100 and the size of a credit-card, I'm comfortably hoping that's the culprit.
 
My material is mostly FLAC that deliciously passes scutiny on the ER4s, so I doubt that's an issue.  It's definitely a Rev2 (white grille).
 

 
You're right, but I've also used the D0 as a USB DAC and the results are the same.  Think I've narrowed it down though - it's not so much that the bass/mids aren't there, more that I'm listening at max amp/source volume and finding that they are at what I'd call a low, comfortable level, while the sharp treble sounds (think the sharp tsk/ch of cymbals, as well as "S"s in speech are what I'd call uncomfortably loud, pre-painful, and that's hiding the detail/quality of the mids/bass.
 
Is that something that would indicate underpowering?
 
*EDIT* I just had a play around in foobar, and I'm having to make the following drops to be able to hear the mids/bass properly.  Still sounds pretty hot though:  -3@7k, -6*10k, -4@14k

I posted these comments earlier on another thread and wanted to share them here since they revolved around the he400...
 
"Okay, I have a brief update that may help some folks out there. I have finally reacquired my he400 ownership. I sold them off but found that I couldn't live without them. I have been listening to the lcd2r2 for a week. So with that sound signature etched securely, I'll make a brief comparison of the lcd to the HFM. Again, no graphs here...just what I hear.
 
Treble: very similar with the he400 being ever so slightly brighter. There is some technical advantage for the lcd that I can just barely pick up on, but very closely comparable. 
 
Mids: The lcd has a beautiful tone to the mids. It's darker than the HFM, yet wonderfully detailed. The mids are certainly in the same ballpark as they are both planars, but the lcd presentation of the mids is better. At 3x the price it should be better right? I love the mids on the lcd..it's maybe the most addictive quality of listening to them. 
 
Bass: This one gets interesting. The bass of the lcd gets bested by the HFM is terms of quantity, but wins out on quality. The lcd has technically better bass. The impact and texture is phenomenal. It's the best I've ever heard when using that criteria. But the quantity is a notch better on the HFM. Please don't let this give you the impression that the HFM bass is boomy and loose. It's certainly not. The he400 just can't quite pull off the texture of the Audeze. It's just so incredibly well rendered...it sounds "expensive" and is. 
 
Other: The first thing that I noticed when I put the he400 back on my head was the weight. The weight difference between the two is significant. I can wear the lcd comfortably for about an hour tops. The he400 I can wear for a good 3 hours. For some this will be a significant difference. Also, I'm feeling no clamp on my jaw as I did with the lcd. Put together this makes the he400 a much more comfortable hp. 
 
Lastly, the he400 sounds noticeably better on the lyr than I imagined it would. Big improvement to my ears over the e09 and odac that I paired it with last time. Wow!!"

Hi, I have been lurking this thread for a while and today I am going to either purchase the he-400 or the refurbished unit hd650 from amazon. Seeing as both of u are on the topic of he-400. I would like to get some last minute advise before purchasing either of them. I have not heard of the he-400 before but i have audition hd 650, he-300 and ms2i before unamped from my s3. I like the mids from ms2i(detailed and smooth) but I want to have something new and slightly less forward sounding to avoid fatigue.
KG from the recommendations thread advise me to go with the ms2i while Mike from headfonia advise me to take he-400. I am slightly looking forward to the he-400 but I just can't forget the smoothness of ms2i mids and would love get something similar. Btw I came from a ms1i. So should I go with the initial plan and just grab the he-400 or?

So I just had a two hour meeting with the headphone specialist of the country. I listened to the HE-400 (rev 3 drivers), HE-500, T70p, mad dogs and my own german maestro gmp.835D.
 
Mad dog was very warm sounding, very nice mids, vocals were fantastic. 
HE-400 was surprisingly bright sounding, did not like them at first, but now I want them!
Let me explain, they are bright, but the amount of seperation is very, very good. Better than on the mad dogs, the HE-400 also had more detail than to my ears.
 
The HE-400 definitely were bright sounding, even a bit sibilant. But the mad dog showed some sibilance as well on some tracks. 
I think I will get the HE-400, but I will definitely tweak the sound by adding a very thin layer of paper in front of the driver. This will smooth out the sound big time.
 
Yes, the mad dogs sound more pleasant to the ear but they are modded to the fullest. And every little drop of SQ is pulled from the drivers. 
The HE-400 however, has a better driver (pretty sure this is true :p), it has more detail, better seperation and better extension on both sides. Yes it's bright, but I think I can solve this by
doing the paper mod. I'm sure there are, or will be, pads replacements which will alter the sound. 
For vocals the mad dog is probably better, it definitely has more full sounding mids. Then again the highs are boosted (in some regions) in the HE-400, so taking some dbs in these regions with an equalizer will help the sound a lot.
 
tl;dr: The HE-400 has better drivers, and I think with some simple mods the HE-400 will sound even better.

Last night, I replaced the velour pads with my phat and super comfortable Lawton audio angled pads, stolen from my poor D2000. I'm not great at describing subtle changes, but here's one thing I can say for sure: the Lawton pads have diminished the uppermost treble peak, while simultaneously shifting the focus toward the midrange. (Again the change is subtle, but sometimes subtle changes can result in big improvements.) Female vocals now seem to be on par with male vocals, which is exactly what I wanted. The pads, on the negative side of things, may have shrunk the sound-stage a little. Although once again, I should stress that this change is subtle--so subtle, in fact, I'm not sure I can confidently report this as fact. But at this point, at least, that's my impression. The sub-bass sounds pretty much the same, though the mid-bass has been bolstered by the change, which has resulted in thicker and juicer mid-bass, but also in a slightly congested or a slightly "boxed in" sound reminiscent of the D2000. (I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe what I'm hearing, but that aside, I don't like this change at all.) All and all, there are some notable trade-offs for using these pads, so I'm not sure I'll use them over the long haul. But, damn, those Lawton pads are so incredibly comfortable! I wonder if re-skinning these pads with high quality velour would be a smart move? Hmmmmmm.

To be honest, the HE400 can go pretty low, but it's not loud at all. It's almost hard to tell it's going that low because it's just not emphasized. That's fine and dandy, since any efforts to boost the volume of sub bass would most certainly muddle other frequencies, but the HD650 is almost immediately more pleasing than the HE400 because you can tell the difference so easily. The HE400 takes an hour of listening to realize the clarity and balanced frequency response compared to the HD650. The layering is especially good though, much, much obvious than with the HD650. I love hearing a separate vocal track and being able to follow it rather than lose it among the combination of everything else. That is one part of the HE400 that rocks. I love the kind of "punch" that some notes have... it's not a punch, but it's some force that you can feel in your ear when the notes hit. They could even be midrange, even higher treble-range stuff, but it just has some sort of resonance... The Veldt by Deadmau5 is a great example. Check it out if you want to know what I mean.

I feel almost exactly the opposite. The hd650 is an amazing pair of headphones, but sometimes I find myself thinking that though they do everything without fault, they somehow never excel at anything in particular. The midrange is where the hd650s shine the most (they are certainly more balanced than the he400's midrange) but those mids, as good as they are, don't seem airy enough, imho, to qualify the hd650 as high-fidelity. The he400, on the other hand, has a few notable weaknesses, but renders bass so perfectly that I can hardly imagine any other hi-fi headphone substantially outperforming them. And for me, the he400's bass is immediately observable; the same holds true for the he400's superior imaging and separation and layering. Now, maybe these are just my subjective preferences, but I genuinely associate those last three qualities with high-fidelity; the hd800, for example, has the best imaging and separation and layering I've ever heard, but without those few stellar attributes the hd800 would be no better than my AKG Q701!  Put another way, the He400 deserves a hi-fi billing, imho, because of its imaging and layering, and yes! because of its bass too--while I would crown the hd650 as the king of all mid-fi headphones, primarily because I can't fault them for doing anything wrong. That's just me though.

It's a shame I never warmed up to the HD650. They were too laid back for me and their pads kept squeaking when it rubbed against my glasses and there was no option to try different pads. I think I'm going to put the HE400 where I also put the D7k. It doesn't do anything that is horribly bad but has good bass and a good coloration where people who like it will really like it. 
 
It doesn't seem like the HE400 is for me at least with my setup or at least as a headphone I would build a system around. It would be a good headphone to have when I want a different signature however. My system is built around the HD800 although it sounds equally as good with the HE6 but it shouldn't impact the HE400 in any way as my D1 is quite transparent. I do appreciate how Fang made a good headphone at not a ridiculous price. 
 
I have tried straight out of my D1 and then with the D1 as a dac and my Mjolnir as the amp.

I've spent around a year with the HD800 and still working on perfecting the sound. I feel like I'm 95% there however with my current setup however I don't think I'm really going to pursue that last couple % since if I was I would spend quite a bit of money since it would go to a D2 dac and I've spent enough money lately. If you think the HD800 is picky try the HE6 which has really strict amping requirements :) 
 
As for the HE400 I have only tried them on the two setups I've listed above since I don't have a 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter to compare how good it would sound from my itouch or phone. However reading the impressions of many makes me believe that is is not picky at all and is easily driven which is not the case for every headphone with this kind of driver. The T50RP is similar in that except it sounds horrible without any modification.

No way to know unless you test it. Easy way to test would be to play pink noise though the headphones while they are on your head, and try to hover the fabric on and off the area of the grill opening but minimizing actual hand movement (as the hand interferes with the sound too). If you notice a significant difference in the tonality of the pink noise with the fabric in the way vs without, then it might not be good.
 
 
This is the exact method I used to gauge how good different types of steel meshes were for the custom grills; stock grills just massacred the other-wise very clean pink noise, pasta strainer mesh is quite clean but induces a high-pitched sssh on top of the clean baseline pink noise, and lastly the garbage bin welded mesh has a slight ssshuu effect (much less than stock) and no high-pitch interference. So naturally I chose the last one.

Yeah, it's the tabs. I can only seem to get three closed at a time. They'd probably go in with a bit more elbow grease, but I hate to man-handle my belongings. Probably why it takes so long for me to switch pads. 
 
The mod was insanely easy to do, much less of a hassle than from the looks of it. In return, you get this yummy, open sound, without losing any heft or body to the sound. You described it best, literally a breath of fresh air for these cans. I also think that I hear maybe a less recessed upper midrange as well, as it sounded wonky at first, until I realized I still had the EQ on. This is much cheaper and much more substantial than hunting for amp pairings for slight improvements. 
 
Now we just need some further distancing pads, which would pretty much be it for the HE-400s.

Hello everyone, this is my first post in this thread.
I had the opportunity to listen to a HE-400 on a Lyr and compare it to an HE-500 on a Mjolnir. The Mjolnir costs $300 more and only connects to symmetric headphones and unfortunately, only the HE-500 was setup in a balanced way.
In summary, the HE-500/Mjolnir combo was much better in my and my friends opinion. Spatial resolution and size of stage were much greater with the Mjolnir pair. The HE-400/Lyr combo sounded more forward but also more "congested" in the mid range.
Luckily, there was a balanced to 6.3 mm adaptor to connect the HE-500 to the Lyr and it became evident for me that a large portion of the differences could be addressed to the different amps. The reason why I am not sure buying the Mjolnir is because I could not connect all headphones to it (eg my AKG Q701). I am considering the HE-400 and I suppose the HE-400 would have been much better on the Mjolnir as well compared to the Lyr. As a take home message: If you consider a Lyr for your HE-400, you may want to consider the Mjolnir if it is in the budget. Just my two cents.

Man, I really have a love/hate relationship with the HE400s. One day I really appreciate their balanced sound with great imaging/layering and sub bass, the next day I find them boring and lacking in bass. There is nothing wowing me right now, though they do sound good. I just have trouble forgetting there are massive hunks of metal on my head. If I did the Beyer velour pad mod and added some more foam on the top, they would probably be a lot better. But I almost don't want to spend another $50 to make these better. I want to like them... but it's hard right now. The HD650s are much more pleasing. I can almost see myself selling/returning the HE400s and keeping the HD600s for the times when I want more clarity. They're so much more comfortable than the HE400s...
 
I really wish I could shave 100g off the weight... Beyer pads would make them 10 times better, I think. The hard velours from HFM are just so... hard! Not enjoyable, to be honest.

I'm considering a mod of the he400 and wanted to get some opinions. I really just don't like the connectors on the he400. I prefer the mini xlr's like on the lcd series. Wait for it.....
 
mini xlr he400 retro-fit 
 
Yeah, you heard me. How nice would it be to slip those cables on and off with one sweet little click? Oh and it gets better. I just got a very nice custom cable from Q Audio and what kind of connectors does it have? If you said mini xlr, then you get a prize.  Now there are some adapters being made but it would be so nice to have a direct connection. 
 
And for a very reasonable extra amount of moolah, I could also have a custom automotive quality paint job on them.  
 
Hang on now...just let the image form in your mind. He400, custom Q cable, and the paint...pearl white. 
 
Yes, I know I'm a bad boy. Chime in if you have a better color in mind.

I did a lot of back-to-back listening today. I agree with you on almost everything. I think that between the HD 595 and HE-400 it is the 400s which sounded really "flat" out of the box. I initially struck with the strong presence of vocals and "lean" sounding bass. Then I went on a rampage and listened to all kinds of music at different volumes. The HE-400s definitely soak up all the available power I have, depending on the recording. I may need to get an amp now for the sake of movie watching and anything else with high dynamic range, as those conditions left me wanting more juice. So now I am starting to spec out a variety of amps looking for something with enough punch to handle these things. Otherwise, these things really do run off a sansa clip or my cell phone - they just don't sound as good. My computer pulls a lot of sound from them, just not always enough.
 
The Senns definitely win on comfort, they are light and "barely there", and the oval shaped cups are more ergonomic. The Hifis are not "uncomfortable", but they clamp harder, and the plugs catch my shoulders as I swing my head around.
 
In terms of sound quality, more exposure is starting to tell me the story. On any recording remotely featuring a live audience / performance, the HE-400 absolutely destroys the 595's. The realism, texture, and even sound of clapping is totally convincing and cool. The superior bass extension also seems to kick in and tended to produce a sound I preferred. This was true of Bjork and Bill Bruford. As I jotted my 5 pages of notes, I started to notice that key words were constantly things like "realism", "3-dimensionality", "effortless presentation", "texture", "smooth", and so on. My ears do find the sound overall more fatiguing (perhaps from the stronger treble presence), but the extra speed, separation, and treble energy made metal and rock songs a lot cooler. About the only time I might clearly prefer the Senn was actually when demoing Radiohead's "King of Limbs". The HE-400s communicated a sparsity in the recordings which was emotionally depressing, and in some ways, the "thicker" presentation of the 595s sounded a little more musical and energetic to me. I think the HE-400s dominated live recordings, jazz, metal, and rock. Electronic was a bit of a toss up, though demoing Frank Ocean and Royksopp, and the Roots, showed me that a "leaner" and "cleaner" bass was often more tolerable to my ears and sounded better overall. The extension also came into play, and I heard extreme low bass notes playing through like never before, and it was cool. But you can see how the added "thump" of the 595s helped to bring some of those types of tracks alive (sort of how you would hear them at the party/club). Where the roots use actual drums, however, the HE-400s were better and less irritating, oddly enough.
 
I feel the senns "laid back" presentation was always a bit of a letdown on rock sessions. "Thicker", "meatier", "comfortable", or "vieled", "flat", "blending" were words that came out of the Senns in a lot of comparisons. They were not truly demolished, in my opinion, because there is a lot to like. They are not known for being "bassy", but in comparison to the HE-400, they present a consistently stronger "thumpiness" and have enough texture and separation to seem detailed. The senns had me following bass grooves far more often than the HE-400, which I though placed the vocals first. They also do have very good extension in their own right, but did not reach some notes that the HE-400 could. Female vocals could be grainy, and live music clapping sounded more like static. The 3-dimensionality and resolution just didn't really compete, and overall they seem to keep you at arms length. I still, after many years, contest that these are probably among a small group of headphones that I promise you can wear about all day and find little real fault with. They are very good and I won't throw them away!
 
That said, the HE-400 come a lot closer to my idea of a perfect headphone experience. They never seem to be working hard at anything, and they are extremely smooth even if they are sucking your amp dry. Only one recording of Norah Jones presented me with some harshness in the vocals which could be a result of the ever so slightly "hot" treble. With some mild EQ tuning, I think they will sound fuller at lower volumes (they could use a slight thump improvement). For now, they remind me of owning a "perfect" subwoofer which some owner has forgotten to dial up a few notches. The realism and separation they can achieve are perhaps the best feature they have. I will use velour pads later on, as for now I don't want to risk breaking anything. One critique perhaps is that they could be more comfortable overall, as it isn't the weight but the clamping and stiff feeling pads on my jaw that feel weird. Also, the "effortless" sound makes me less aware of whether or not I am at volumes which might be damaging! Its weird. I am used to speakers letting me know when I am pushing them too hard. These planers seem to have no limit so far.
 
The Senn HD 595s are, in contrast, super comfortable, easy to wear, and easy to love. They work well with far less power, and have a sound signature that works well at all volumes. Makes me wonder just how good the HD650s really could be. I don't think they have many real flaws, other than being too "polite" at times. Also, where the HE-400 seems to ninja through a complex recording, the HD595s seem to "bounce" off them, hoping to keep you thinking about basslines and vocals while a lot of other sounds can get lost or much harder to distinguish.

I've read a lot of comments on HE400s from people who own lots of higher end headphones and owned/auditioned these, and the consensus seems to be that its only flaw (might be minor~nonexistent to some ears, severe to other ears) is that its mid treble is a bit "tizzy", and that's with the fixed non-rev3 versions of the HE400s. I tend to agree with that observation, this tizziness is mostly only noticeable in certain vocals, but it is definitely there and is the one thing that's making the treble not 100% smooth. 
 
For some weird reason, I can't recall having any of this tizziness with my older HE400s that I had earlier this year which I sent back for replacement (due to driver damage); I'm not sure if it's because I wasn't listening as analytically with regards to the treble, or if older units were indeed free of this tizziness. 
 
If somehow this tizziness can be reined under control, via some sort of damping or amp pairing, then I wouldn't see any real flaw with the sound at all and technically it'd be close to perfect for my taste. So far that is the only minor gripe I have with its sound.

Great write up! I think with more voltage and power, and maybe some burn-in too, you'll see that the he400 can be quite "thumpy." I was using the Little Dot MKiii with some sweet mullard tubes to drive these cans, and the bass was great in almost every way--I had no complaints whatsoever. But when I started to use an old kenwood receiver to power the he400s instead, my jaw dropped: now the bass sounds positively  extraordinary! I said something to this effect earlier, but I think I should say it again: properly powered, the he400 has as much bass presence and thump as my Denon D2000s (which are widely reputed to be great headphones for bass)--only the he400's bass is way cleaner, with zero mid-bass bloat. Who knows? Maybe my he400's just have good synergy with this crazy receiver of mine. With that in mind, I'm not saying the difference between my various setups is not night and day, but now that they have real power, I would say that my He400 has crossed a threshold, so to speak, and in doing so, I think I have realized their full potential.

Interesting description - "tizziness". On the Norah Jones recording, I am used to an odd "ringing" (not in my ears) noise or sort of flapping that seems just behind some of the bass hits, which are strong in the recording. It is a Danger Mouse production, which seems to mean "aggressive". I catch this noise (or sensation) through the HD 595 and swear I got it from the HE400, suggesting it is in the recording. I really should be selective about describing her voice as "harsh", because I didn't mean "uneven frequency response". Literally the HE-400 are bar-of-soap-smooth and controlled. I think Norah's voice or the recording may have been reaching into the upper midrange, treble area, where we know the HE400 start to emphasize. It was the only sense of "won't be listening to this one at high volume over and over" that I found so far. The overall recording quality, like I said, is aggressive and sort of gritty.

I am going to try an Onkyo receiver later. My ears are on break. Below is a table showing expected SPL at different power levels, in this case, mWs, based on the published spec of 92.5 dB/mW. Something between 512 mWs and 1 full watt are needed to hit around 120 dB, which I think provides more than enough headroom for movies and other HDR recordings (which I find my current power lacking right now). 500 mWs is the minimum power I would guess is needed to go from quiet to riot on practically anything I throw at these.

The Amp would have to make this power at 35-50 Ohms (test results seem to consistently place the HE-400 at 50, not 35 Ohms). Alternatively, this seems to require amps of up to 4-5Vrms (120 dB), which rules out most portables. The JDS Labs Objective 2 is the early best option so far, which is rated at 613 mWs @33 Ohms (355 mW @150) but up to 7Vrms. Power output seems optimized for lower impedance loads, and the HE-400 may fall too far out of the range. The Fiio E9 has the power, but is more of a "dock", and output impedance is high (10 Ohms). The Schiit Asgard has enough juice, according to an Amazon customer, but is rated 1Vrms, max 7Vrms, and I have no idea the mW output. The Audio GD 12.1 is a beast, but I still don't like the website and the cost with shipping is probably closer to $300. I am putting a constraint of $100-$200 dollars on this pursuit, since I don't think amps should cost more than the speaker, and I am broke anyway. Also, it has to be laptop friendly. I really like that the JDS labs uses a 3.5mm input, for example, since that is typical PC. USB interface is also convenient. Anyone want to throw out some ideas? I am all ears.

Using the power of math (thanks to other members), I have a rough idea of a few amps:
 
TI TPA6120A2 chip (found in some high end sound cards, 10 Ohm output):
Impedance
Output
16
1,160 mW
32
890 mW
50
120 mW
600

79 mW

Schiit Asgard (1 Ohm output):
Impedance
Output
16
2,710 mW
32
1,440 mW
50
942 mW
600

81 mW

Audioengine D1 (10 ohm output):
Impedance
Output
32
72.3 mW
50
55.7 mW
600
6.5 mW
 
Perhaps as expected, higher output impedance has a huge impact on power output as the headphone impedance goes up. At 50 Ohms, even a good performer like the TI has fallen on its face in terms of reaching our 500 mW level. Notice that the Asgard maintains big power through 50 Ohms, but at 600 would be down to an estimated 81 mW. First key spec then is a minimum output impedance! Unfortunately, I haven't found a combination of higher voltage / lower output impedance yet other than the Schiit and the JDS Labs O2.
 
Hifiman should really work on reducing headphone impedance to about 32 Ohms, maybe even less.

It is a difference that can only be measured by your wallet! Lol.
 
I do think that equipment differences can matter to a point. My experience with car audio (a whole different issue from headphones) has taught me that there are key features that matter: Decks with time alignment, high volt outputs @ low impedance matter, properly shielded interconnects can matter (engine whine sux), and matching power requirements of speakers to amps. But nothing impacts the sound like well-chosen speakers, and to a lesser extent, attention to the installation. I paid more for amps and speakers than I had to years ago, but the key benefit was that the amps lasted for over a decade before finally calling it quits. Speakers are less finicky, but I've had dust caps thrown from subs because the glue had dried out and failed.
 
In the world of computer audio, I would take a VIA or Realtek chipset over sound blaster any day, but its hard to imagine that a dedicated amp and DAC could exert THAT much influence over the sound, unless the DAC/AMP was total crap. Their job is to replicate and amplify a sound anyway, not change it. If it is changing it drastically, something is horribly wrong.

The Sennheisers HD650 are rated @ 102 dB/1Vrms. Innerfidelity says they reach 90 dB @ .13 mW. Just based on that, You would need approximately 133 mWs @ 300 Ohms to reach 120 dB, which should be more than enough for regular music, movies, and so on. The JDS Labs amp should put out 163 mWs @ 300 Ohms, based on the same math I am doing. At just 67 mWs, you should reach 117 in theory, which is really close also, but shows the jump in power needed to gain those last 3 dBs. JDS or the Schiit should provide ample power. A fiio E9 can probably drive them well also, as they should work well at higher impedances. Also the NuForce Icon.
 
A different website suggested sticking to Amps with rated power of 2Vrms or more for best results. This is probably true, but I would stick to lower output impedance. The Audioengine D1 probably does 13 mWs @ 200 Ohms (10 Ohm output resistance), which only reaches about 100 dB. There may not be enough "headroom" for high dynamic range material, like watching a DVD.

I think the "issue" here is most people who get HE400s have not heard any planar headphones extensively prior, so they are not familiar with the planar bass response, which is extremely neutral, extended, and textured. Instead there is a pre-disposition to the dynamic headphone bass sound, which even in the best headphones is (almost) always a slight hump centered around the mid-bass with a gradual rolloff all across low/sub-bass.
 
Also mechanically speaking the two types of bass response are quite different - planar bass is emanating from all points of the huge diaphragm in equal amounts allowing for an omnipotent presence through moving of air between the diaphragm and your ears, while dynamic bass is coming from the outskirts of the dome diaphragms and sort of pass along the inner rims of the earpads and conduct to your ears in an uneven manner.

See, I really wasn't wowed by the HE400s either. I still haven't really been wowed, except for when I turned on a sine wave generator, cranked my Lyr to 12 o'clock and played a 30Hz wave. That made my head vibrate. But I would never ever listen to music that loud. They have a balanced response, that's for sure. It's kind of unfortunate though, as I really want to be wowed by something. For $400, you deserve to have more than a few moments where you can just close your eyes and disappear into the music because it sounds so good. The sad thing is even $1000 headphones don't offer that. There are a few songs I've heard, different for each headphone, that really shine. I've had very few moments where I played a song, it sounded great, turned it up a bit, and just sat back in amazement. You know, the one where you conduct the song as it's playing? Where you feel like you're really there?
 
Planar technology is cool, but it doesn't wow me. The instrument separation though.............. that has surprised me a few times.

Try the Bose Tri-Ports or maybe some Monster Beats.

Seriously though - I went after a different sound deliberately and took a chance on these too. Audio gear has always followed the "law of diminishing returns". The first $100 dollar set it 50x better than the $10 dollar set. The $200 dollar set is 25x better than the $100, the $400 dollar set is 5X better, the $1000 dollar set is 2X better, the $10,000 dollar set is worse than the $1000.
 
I was scared to find out what happens when shifting from a $250 dollar Sennheiser to a $500 dollar Sennheiser - because it probably would be twice as good overall. But find a better sound in a regular speaker anywhere in the world, I dare you. Headphones are not perfect, but you can't find a more affordable high-end sound. Unlike a home theater however, you cannot pick and choose your bass, midrange, and treble response by picking up a new sub, new mains, or a better receiver. Good luck with your search!

I definitely feel spoiled and underappreciative, having 3 pairs of headphones each costing over $300 and still finding ways to complain about them. I just really like hearing different kinds of sound and hoping one really feels right for me. I doubt I'll ever find that day. I just wish I could find headphones that complemented each other really well without having to sacrifice a desired quality like mids. The DT880s were great, if a little short on bass, but I loved their sound except for the shallow mids. Sometimes it just felt like the singer was far away. The HD600s have great mids with a balanced bass and treble presentation, and are honestly the best all-rounder I can think of. The HD650s have an addictive bass punch to them that the HD600s fall short on, as well as being a bit smoother. They're definitely very colored though. The HE400 has fantastic imaging and instrument separation with great detail resolution and textured sub bass, with no real fault to the mids given the other great qualities. They're just not as exciting as they could be.
 
Best qualities of all that I've tried in the past month and a half, excluding the Momentum:
 
DT880: COMFORT, clarity/detail resolution, textured bass
HD600: Comfort, natural sound, forward mids
HD650: Punchy bass, liquid smooth sound
HE400: Accurate & textured sub bass, instrument separation, detail resolution
 
Best all-rounder: HD600
Most fun: HD650
 
But to be entirely honest, I think my brain is extremely bipolar with headphones day-to-day. I haven't been able to figure out why I favor different sounds on different days. What bothers me the most is when I'm actually unimpressed, almost turned off by a pair of headphones. I listened to my HD650s for over an hour tonight and wasn't impressed at all. It just sounded warm and boring to me. Then I decided to pull out the HD600s and A/B some music with cellos and pianos in it, and I'm having a fun time picking out the differences. The HD600 sounds so good for some things. I'm almost liking them more than the HD650, save for music with punchy bass.
 
So I don't want to get rid of all my pairs for fear of missing the sound of one of them, and buying another pair and feeling like an idiot, only to get them and realize I hyped them up way too much in my head. Sort of what I did while waiting for my replacement HE400s. I just want to be happy with my purchase, you know? Personally, I think if you spend $400 on anything and you don't love it, you should return it. The problem is, I love them all depending on the day.  What is wrong with me?

Lol, I could afford it but I don't need a brick on top of my head. Comfort is a huge deal for me which is why I constantly bitch about it with the HE400. My HD600 is really comfy after putting them on a pillow day and night for 2 weeks when I was at work or sleeping. I've been doing the same with the HD650 for less than the week I've had it, but it hasn't quite reached "comfy" territory yet. It's definitely better than the HE400 but they do clamp a fair amount. When I first pulled them out of the box and pulled them open to put them on my head I was like, whoa, these are pretty clampy...
 
I think I suffer from severe cases of not knowing what you had until it's gone. Call it being ungrateful. Call it wanting more. Call it whatever you want. I wish there was a way to train myself to be satisfied.

I tried emailed JDS labs for spec confirmation. Interestingly they gave a different one:
 
<534 @ 33 Ohms
 
NwAvGuy Data allows a simple graph to be made but I couldn't get the image to post
 
The O2 probably hits a voltage ceiling of about 5.2Vrms and is optimized for 33 Ohm loads on straight batteries. My best guess is that it can put ~442 mWs into a 50 Ohm load on batteries. This would, in theory, take them to a max of between 117 and 120 dBs.
 
On AC power the O2 appears able to pull over 7.2Vrms, and this lets it make about a half a watt between say, 25 and 100 Ohms, pretty nifty. It appears to peak at about 80 Ohms, actually, and output doubles at 600 Ohms to about 80 mWs. At 50 Ohms, my "best guess" is ~ 706 mWs, which is pretty damn astonishing. If that output is true, then estimated output rises to between 120-123 dB (emphasis on the former). All these values are max values @ 1% THD I should mention.
 
Just in terms of meeting power needs on the cheap then, the O2 kicks butt. I think only something like the Asgard could supply more, given the frank reality of the O2 running on an 18V combo and it running on a 20V.
 
*** Edit - The Asgard apparently can do about 1 W @ 50 ohms (clipping). A review also put similar into the "good" not "great" range in terms of max volume using a 1V source when powering 91 dB efficient LCDs. So, it would seem that we Planar freaks have to strive for about a watt to gain some headroom over more difficult programming.

Yokken -
 
You aren't crazy. I have a similar issue. I look forward to hearing the same songs on cheap ass boomboxes, in cars, on cans, and so on, and can always come up with a wish list.
 
In my evaluation of the HE-400s, I listened to "stay" by the DMB - an excellent recording which I think sounds great even on crappier hardware. Its just beautifully mastered. No way around it. I thought Bjork live and Bill Bruford sounded incredible on the HE-400, embarrassing the HD595s. On the other hand, Radiohead was a bit more fun on the punchier sounding Sennheisers, specifically because the bloat up the recording in ways I like. The HE-400 was a better quality sound, for sure, but made Radiohead that much more depressing to me.
 
I stepped down from a 10 inch sealed sub in the car to an 8-inch "microsub" by JL audio because I wanted to just run a smaller, single amp, and reclaim trunk space while still getting a good response. That sub is truly an overachiever, and gets it done, but I often miss the days of having twice the power and twin 10 inchers which similar sound quality. Sometimes you want that booming in your face music, some days a smooth response and slight rumble is perfect. I say, start a headphone collection, and just go with it!

I remember your response to me when I just got the HE-400 and being whiny about that recessed mid-treble. I didn't knew it was the recessed mid-treble until you said it. All I know is that the vocals (male or female) sound weird on these things, they're like stiffened or kinda not being able to move freely to me. And so as the cymbals (open hihats/crashes). Like something is blocking them for sounding natural.
That mid-treble abscence is very existent to me the first time I heard HE-400 out of the box. And then my brain kinda let go of the problem after using it for days and got used to that but whenever listening to a good dynamic driver phones (HE-400 is my only Planar Magnetic) like Beyer DT 1350 or Senn MX 980 (these are so good and underrated possibly because of the price and how it looks but you guys should definitely have an audition especially those who consider earbuds) with even 1-2 songs, switching to the HE-400 makes it annoying again. The first time I heard it I thought I wasted money (there's alot of complications on returning it if I just didn't liked it) and I wouldn't be able to adjust to it, but thankfully I did. It can become almost non-existent to my ears when I use it for long periods of time (15 mins or so).

Well I modded my HE400! The headband was easy to put on and it's nice and soft. The earpads took more work. I had to use a scissors to taper down the rings (from the pleathers) so the DT990 pads would fit. They're like 1/4" too short in diameter. The foam that came with them isn't attached to the pads either so once I got the pads around the rings I had to shove the foam in there and tighten it by pushing it in to each side. I might glue it on, but I'm not sure I wanna do that yet. It is a lot thicker than the thin cloth on the HE400 pads. First impressions, it seems just a little muted sadly. Treble is still a tad pushy, mids are okay, maybe a little recessed, and the sub bass seems a little rolled off, which takes away from what makes these headphones awesome in the first place. I think I'm gonna head to Michael's this weekend and shop around for some thin cloth that I can experiment with.
 

 
 

 
If anyone has suggestions on what to look for as far as the cloth/foam goes, it would be much appreciated.

It rocks. Combined with the comfort of the pads, these things are much more comfortable than they were. It's almost a joke how much more comfortable they are. With the headband I've pretty much forgotten about their weight and without the stiff pads pressing into my head, these can disappear on my head. Still not as comfortable as the HD6xx or DT880 (obviously) but it's a vast improvement. I'd suggest everyone get that headband. It's cheap as hell and works great.
 
Also, I took the foam out and I'm listening to them with nothing protecting the drivers  and they sound much improved than with the foam. I'll definitely need to find a few different types of cloth to try because I want to protect the drivers. If I had to guess, I'd say the softer pads are absorbing just a teeny bit of bass, which is probably why the HFM velours are stiff. But the texture and extension is still there.

I use that eq for my tuning needs. It is a little bit of a pain in the A to use, but if you know what frequencies you want to play with, its quick to set up and it automatically tweaks gain to reduce distortion.
 
So far, I've done nothing to the HE's but drop 1 khz 3 dB and surrounding freqs by 1-2 dB. This picked up the midbass slightly (to my ears). The HE's have a major dip to 2 khz, and then ramp up hard to about 10 khz (about 10 dB over 2 Khz). I tried dropping 10 khz 2-3dB and scaling back through 3-5 khz by similar amounts. I didn't really like it. 
 
With the 31 band EQ, if you really want to get nutty, you can actually make adjustments to each channel - though I am not sure why you would do this. I set and forget.
 
The HE's take really well to EQ adjustments. Though you should be aware that the freq response is so "flat" at stock settings that it seems easier to make the sound worse than improve it!

Also, to the person having trouble swapping pads:
 
It is super easy really. Pinch the edge of the pads and gently tug away and look for one of the plastic tabs that is holding it to the cup (you won't see it). You'll know you have one when no space opens between the pad and the cup. There are four of them (at 12, 3, 6, and 9 O'clock relatively speaking), but you only need to get one to pull off.
 
Pinch at that point, and then feel around under the pad until you detect the "ring" that connects to the cup / pad. Press down with a firm but gentle grasp and push down (like you want to deform the circle into an "oval". You should feel/see the plastic tab (shaped like a hook) release. Then just pull up and the whole pad should come off nice and easy.
 
To put the pads back on, gently "slide" the pad back in to the cup. You should be able to get 3 of the 4 tabs in without any special maneuvering. When you accomplish that, gently pinch the top and bottom of the ring and forcefully bend it so the last tab can "scoop" itself into position like the other tabs. I did all my pinching and pulling from "12 o clock".
 
The whole operation is fast and pretty straight-forward. You shouldn't have to manhandle the things.

Yes i actually did..i used the matrix to burn in the he500's..5 days non-stop playing..and he didnt give a peep..  .i used the hifiman hm602 as the source...and i am serious now..it sounded really good! Even to a point i used it as refence to the two darkvoices i was interested to buy..the guy had both of them to sell..i wil tell u..the 3322 was NO MATCH against the little matrix...everything was better on the matrix! Only the beast the 337 was better..but again..its way in another price league..especially with the rare and expensive tubes he had in it..i heard some other tubes on the 337 and believe me..i loved my matrix more..so if the 337 didnt have these particular tubes i would say..my matrix would be my amp still...its so clear sounding with good bass..good soundstage also..but u dont need to believe my word on it..check forums..u will read same things about the matrix and the he500..and those are not modded!
The knob never get passed the 2 pm on my matrix..for the price..its unbeatable..check other forums..more people say they pair surprisingly well...i dont know how it compares to the master of power the lyr..but that amp is twice the price..and u need to tube roll to get the best out of it..my matrix is up and running when u switch it on..and for sale now..  : for ur info..its bought in december last year.

I don't have the HD650 yet, and I got it for it's velvety mids, and unfatiguing sound signature (FWIH). It should be here in an hour or so.
I use my DT990/600 for my main music/gaming/bassy needs. This is about the 5th one I've owned, and this time, it will more than likely be the headphone I stick with, at least until and if ever Hifiman makes a bassy planar (as in bass enhanced). That or some other open, velour padded headphone satisfies me in the bass section.
The 990/.600 has the perfect amount of bass. Strong, but not overly so. It could use refinement, like less sizzle on the treble, and a fuller sound like the HE400, but the DT990/600 is the closest I have come to having everything I wanted in one headphone. It checks more boxes than the HE400 for me.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/5/12 at 9:42am

I think it's best to avoid the angle pads; I can confirm though that the pads fit perfectly onto the stock ring and that they feel super comfortable to boot; I can also confirm that they tame the treble a bit and mitigate the upper mid-range recession too, which all sounds great on paper, but let me tell you, after three days of using those pads, I couldn't wait to get back to the velours. The angle pads, as nice as they are, seemed to make the mid-range sound a little boxed in and just a tad congested; also the sub-bass didn't sound quite as deep or clean to me, and not half as exciting as they did with the velours. I can only speak for myself, but I think angled pads  do not work well on the he400; really, they create as many problems as they solve. I'm more convinced than ever: the pads just need to get out of the way. If the velours were more comfortable I wouldn't even think of upgrading, but unfortunately they do cause considerable discomfort when used for prolonged periods, and so an upgrade is a must.

You know, interestingly, when I had the HE-400, I found that lifting the cups just slightly away from my ears (half an inch to an inch) created a more enveloping, airy, life-like sound. And a tad better balanced, too. I didn't do it a lot, but every time I slightly lifted the cups away, I thought I liked the sound better... It made me curious how they'd sound with deeper cups...
That said, I am going to try the HE-400 one more time. I had the rev3 last time, and an amp that put about 300mw into them, which technically would be enough. But this time I will hopefully get a proper HE-400, and I also now have the NFB15.1 which will give it ~2.5W. Not sure if I should expect any realistically noticeable improvement from amp to amp, but we'll see. I'm excited to hear that awesome instrument separation again, though! It was my favorite thing about the HE-400.
Oh, and I'll also be comparing them to a Wood Magnum V4 Build, HE-500, and maybe the HD600. Not sure if I'll need to try the HD600, as I bought the HD598 at one time, but returned them because their sound sig did not suit me. Not enough treble energy for me. Not sure if HD600 will be more of the same or not. My current amp is also much better than the one I used with the HD598 for what it's worth.
Will post impressions on the headphone match-up when I get through with it - may not be for a few weeks!

I've been listening to the HE-400 for the past two hours, or three? I can't stop... the comfort is not an issue for now, the cable is too hard, I swapped the pleather pads after the first 20 minutes... with the velours the sound is definitely more pleasing! My M-stage is with a-class opa627bp and caps shunt mod, I'm using its internal dac now, the volume knob is on 12-1 o'clock (10 gain), it sounds pretty good. Some other day I'll try the Yulong A100/D100 pair with the cans, and listen to the K550 and K701 to compare. The bass really kicks, especially with electronic/computer generated bass - lower freq bass. Right now I'm listening to Wrong by Depeche Mode and the song sounds somewhat fuller than usual, the Daft Punk songs sound awesome! Listened to some metal and rock and was also amazed how these headphones can play many genres without being wrong at something in particular. Bad/old recordings sound awful of course, but listening to wind instruments made me wonder why I don't have more classical music on my computer... The highs can be piercing sometimes, but rarely for now/for me. Listening to Mad Season - Long Gone Day, 00:47 here, over and out.

They definitely don't need all that power, but as long as the volume is down, it shouldn't hurt too much as well. I actually bought them for a upcoming HE-6 rig as well, but it's nice to see how they do with the HE-400. For me, they get huge volumes even when the knob is down pretty low. I would not recommend anything over 1-2 o'clock with these, ever.
 
Sound-wise, it's akin to a M^3 but with vastly more power. Sort of warm, but not really. Somewhere between the M^3 and the Asgard in terms of warmth. Pretty level everywhere else. The bass really enjoys all that power and the kick is phenomenal. Treble rolls off slightly at the very top, but its pretty benign, and in some cases, preferable for the HE-400s as the upper treble can be a bit too sparkly. I think they sound a bit better than the Lyr, and in some cases comparable with the Mjolnir from what I remember (I've only heard it with the LCD-2, so now I'm going by what I hear off those). Bass is slightly more authoritative and textured, but the midrange is definitely less clean and refined. At $249 though, the fact that they beat out the Lyr and get this close to the Mjolnir is laughable.
 
These are just some impressions yesterday along with my cousin's Lyr and Mjolnir. I only got around 3-4 hours of listening time though, so take that as you may. We had the HD800 around, but no speaker taps for it, so couldn't listen to the Emotiva with it.

Like I said, I'm bipolar about headphones. One day I like a pair and one day I don't. But strangely it only seems to happen when the HE400 is involved. It sounds great when my Lyr is all warmed up, but I don't like that requirement, and I don't like the weird pressure it puts on my head after wearing it for an hour. Also like I said, I think if you spend $400 on something and you don't love it, you shouldn't keep it. I think I'm going to be selling my HD600s too since they're so close to the HD650s and get some 600ohm DT880s, which I really liked the sound of (250ohm) but neglected (and subsequently returned) after getting the HD600s and HE400s.
 
Not to mention, after getting all this equipment and spending a lot of time listening to music, my ears tend to fatigue easier now and the HE400 treble is just a tad hot for my liking. I like the "nice" treble on the HD650s. Doesn't ever make me cringe and still sounds great with a lot of stuff. The DT880 treble was detailed but smooth, rarely ever piercing. And now I have a great amp to drive the high impedance cans! Plus I might be able to get a really good deal on the DT880s, brand new too.

MR Mateo Head Bought his first Headphone Amp! PART 1
 
If you hate reading, I'll cut to the chase: It was the best amp I could find, and I really, really like it. It seems to be a good deal @160 all in, but I still think $100 would make it a market crushing steal.
 
Today I received my O2 Amp from JDS Labs - a second guilty purchase following the HE-400s. I ordered it with the Triad 12 VAC 200a adapter. I also opted for "stock" gain set at 2.5x and 6.5x and a black faceplate, which I thought was classier looking than the silver one. That said, I despise our world for seeming to always paint everything black or gray. This is why I like my headphones BLUE! Even if its plastic . . .
 
Why did I want an Amp???
 
I bought the amp because I found my computer had inadequete power for High Dynamic Range Recordings (HDR). HDR recordings are those where the difference between the loudest sound, and softest sound, can have a very large spread. In my case, this occurs with some classical music, DVDs, and even Mp3s I own. In effect I cannot reach loud sound levels with these recordings, sort of like being stuck in a car that needs to hit the highway but is stuck in 1st gear.
 
Why did I choose the O2?
 
First I determined that the HE-400s might require as much as 0.5-1 watt in order to achieve 100-120 dB. This is far louder than I would ever actually listen (and maybe louder than they can actually play), but I figured this would give me "headroom" and help me achieve good volume with the cans no matter what I was doing. I looked all over the place for a reasonably priced amps of all kinds, including USB/DAC combo drives, high-end amps, even external sound cards with jacked up headphone ports. My experience with audio has taught me that it is generally stupid to buy anything which might NEED x watts rms to run to its potential, and then give it half that power. I consider headphones generally no different, though I am a firm believer that for 90% of headphones out there, buying amps and DACs is a total waste of money. If you really crave a better sound, put the bucks into the headphones (speakers).
 
Amp Shopping Sucks:
 
About 90% of the amps were eliminated based on the following criteria: 
 
a) Unpublished specs: If you won't report your power at multiple impedances, I won't buy your amp. If I can't derive values from copious calculations generated with the help of the geniuses here at head-fi and your limited specs, you are really, really out of the running. That was easy.
 
b) Price: As in, holy s*** you charge that much for 1 freaking watt? I once owned 738 watts of class a/b goodness from TWO amps in a car for less than that. $200 bucks is a damn generous budget, IMHO, considering its far more than most good soundcards, most all good USB/DAC combos, and could even buy a decent receiver which probably has a decent headphone jack onboard (and a sh**load of inputs and outputs as well as power for big awesome speakers). Actually $200 can buy some damn nice headphones too.
 
c) Assumed performance: If you want 0.5-1 watt, you are not going to get it from a USB-powered source. You just aren't. It took a lot of math to prove this to myself. Thanks, Fiio.
 
d) Output Impedance: Surprisingly, this eliminated most decent inexpensive amps, and even expensive soundcards. They damn near all had 10 Ohm output impedance, which kills power at higher impedances. Following the 1/8 rule, it also optimizes these amps for headphones of 80 ohms or more. Being that the HE-400s are about 35-50 Ohms, I looked for 4-6 Ohms MAX at the output stage. Actually, I am quite surprised that this is so common. Most of my cheapy headphones are 16-32 ohms, and as a general rule amplifiers won't deliver much power into 300 - 600 ohm loads common at the high-end of cans. Even 100 ohms is high enough to crush a lot of consumer amps I looked at.
 
e) Tube Amps: I don't want to buy tubes. I don't. I don't care how awesome tube amps are. I don't want to know about it. They cost more money, and sooner or later they burn out. My parents have a Sony DLP TV which goes through 1-2 bulbs a year @$300 bucks. The TV is sick, but jeez. Were it not for warranty games, they could've bought me a 60" by now with a Playstation. Why are their so many tube amps?
 
Choose Something, Stupid:
 
After much pain, then, it came down to the HRT Headtstreamer, Schiit Asgard, and Objective O2. The headstreamer doesn't have nearly the power I was looking for, despite meeting other criteria. The Asgard was over budget, and reviewers claim it emitted a steady electric hum. That said, it can do about 1 W @ 50 Ohms and likely is a good amp with plenty of power. For the price, I don't like the metal power switch in the rear, and I think it should offer a 3.5 mm in, RCA in, and what the hell, an optical or coaxial digital jack and not just a set of RCAs. I am ruthless and greedy, I know.
 
So, there wasn't much choice. But I believed in the O2's "open source design", and trusted the specs. From those specs, I derived a power curve which suggested 440 mWs on batteries, and 706 mWs on AC @ 50 ohms. In theory, then, very close to meeting (or actually meeting) my 120 dB performance challenge. Because the O2 has built-in current limiting however, those are peak values and represent max power before audible distortion. Now throw in 2.5x and 6.5x gain switches, and unknown source current (I think 1 Vrms, I don't know), and we have what I call an educated guess that happiness is assured. $160 bucks was pushing it, but I couldn't find anything better. Does anyone else think JDS labs KNOWs that??? the $30-$50 dollar DIY wonder amp selling for three times the price? That's what I get for being a non-engineer I guess.  
 
Description of the O2:
 
Mine shipped quickly and arrived in about 3 business days - but I had to sit out the weekend. I have to say, it looks great in black, and it quite adorable. It is like the baby of my car amp. Seriously, its like 2 packs of bicycle cars side by side (or butts, if you smoke). The batteries inside give it a "substantial" weight, and it all around seems very well put together. The volume knob has a good feel, and the fit and finish are a 4/5. Their was some slight mis-alignment percieved between I/O jacks and the power cord didn't just "slide" or click in at first. The gain and power switch feel a little low rent, but otherwise, its nice.
 
Mine also came with small 3M rubber feet stick-ons, a nice touch (which will probably fall off 1 at a time). It came out of the box ready to go, hooked up quickly, and having all the jacks in the front wasn't as bad as I thought. It even makes sense when you think about it (the thing won't "suspend" between my headphones and its input jacks). Also, I can stand it on its ass or 2 sides. Its an accesible design choice, and it would be fun to velcro the thing under my desk or somewhere handy. I could also leave it in a bag, and use it to "stealthily" power my phones when at a library or some other place.
 
I disagree with others that do not consider this thing portable. It wouldn't go in my pocket or jogging, sure, but I can imgaine carrying it in a computer bag or something, to provide better fidelity wherever I ended up. I will concede however, that I might worry a little about the buttons and knob taking knocks, and maybe the batteries inside dislodging from a bad drop. It looks like a baby desktop amp, and that is perhaps its best use. I like the red LED power light, but otherwise am used to devices giving me something more specific, like, "4 hrs left", or, "92%". Then again, those things are hardly ever accurate, and simplicity is nice for a change.
 
Of course, none of this aggravating reading means s*** if it sounds like s***. Next up is part 2 - SOUND!

It seems like many of us got their HE-400s today. I might be posting this late. I got my replacement he-400 this morning with Velours. And similar to someone here, I had to run to college immediately after that. Didn't feel good at all leaving them unopened.
 
I originally ordered them from crutchfield. Got them 2 days later with free shipping. Then tried them for 2-3 days, wasn't impressed and then read about the replacement.
 
I came home early just to start listening. And now I can't stop. These are wonderful. All my classical/blues/classic rock collection sounds extraordinary. Such details, instrument separation, soundstage, accuracy over the whole spectrum..... all the things I read about these headphones were true..... well almost....
 
I'm not feeding these through any dac or amp right now... just plain on-board soundcard. But still, it sounds great. I have to be honest and tell about my previous headphones though... I own M50s, QC-15s and AE2s (don't kill me for buying Bose. I got them really cheap. Around $150 for QC). I have E11 that I bought for M50s. Compared to M50s or QC-15s, this is a great step up for me.
 
So, I guess I need an amp and/or dac. But I don't understand all of you saying that these require a lot of power..... Because I'm listening to these with the system volume at 75% and I don't want to go above that. Actually 60% is where I'm listening to them right now. So, I don't know what to do now.... Should I go by the common consensus and buy a dac and/or amp or just keep them like this?
 
Just a little more bass is desirable though... just a tiny bit more.... off to tweaking EQ.

MR Mateo Head Bought his first Headphone Amp! PART 2
 
I broke this review into 2 parts because it was too frickin' long. Part 1 talks about the decision process and impressions of the hardware.
 
So, we bought an O2 and have been playing with it all day. The goal was to gain headroom for HDR recordings, a problem I experienced during my introduction to the HE-400s. I also figured it would be nice to have an amp that could power future headphones of, say, 150-600 ohms. While it would have been easier to just buy the O2+ODAC for $300 and call it good, I opted for the standalone amp, and would probably buy the DAC separately, since separate components have their advantages. I still think the price of entry is high, but that should wear off in a month or so.
 
For those that hate long posts: Problem Solved.
 
For those that crave detail, read on.
 
Performance: Full disclosure, I am NOT one of those persons that believes every change in equipment = change in sound. At least, not usually a big or perceptible change anyway. If you want a big change, buy some new cans. Amps serve a very specific purpose, and all I want is reliability, ample power, and easy and abundant connecting methods if possible. 80-90% of my listening needs are met with the weaker amp of my computer. It even sounds great to me, and I doubt there is much out there that would be an immediate "must have". Bottom line: recordings are heavily colored, compressed, and vary widely in presentation. Headphones with "sound signatures" and weird driver technologies are making choices about how recordings should sound as well. If your AMP, DAC, and Monster cables are ALSO screwing with your sound, what you have is total chaos and a pretty impossible problem to solve. Amps and DACs should pass a clean signal, that is about it. If they aren't, I consider that more a problem than a wonderful, redeeming quality. I run a laptop with Realtek 888 inside, and I have no idea how great it is (specs v. reality), but I know it seems clean, neutral, and performs great. It also rewards my ears when using higher quality recordings.
 
First and foremost, even at 2.5X gain (default), the O2 drives the HE-400s to painful volumes (for me), and is capable of making my quieter recordings much louder. I did hit the top of the volume knob while watching the Eagles "Hell Freezes Over", but switching to 6.5X again got me to a point I would not sustain for any real length of time. I heard some source noise at 2.5X and 6.5X while watching a DVD (just some slight background hiss), which wasn't typically noticeable. That said, I am not sure I can say, unequivecally, that I wouldn't seek even more power for headphones any less efficient (or similar) than the HE-400s. Even using a cell phone as source, however, volume was noticeably increased.
 
That said, I've got to admit that this little O2 made me wonder how I made it this long without an Amp. I have been using the HE-400s exclusively for awhile, and my ears have "adjusted" to them quite a bit. I may need to consider re-writing my subjective impression of sound quality. I have listened to most all the same tracks I demoed in my A/B comparison to the HD595s, and believe the overall presentation of the HE400s has shifted.
 
With all my EQ tweaks removed, I find that the HE's are much punchier and more energetic with the O2 than without it. The low bass response and midbass response seems stronger, and the treble energy, still there, is perhaps better controlled. The initial "lean" presentation which struck me when I started listening to these may not be replicated had I started with an amp versus starting with the computer itself. Any bass heavy track I've thrown at it so far can almost punish me with well-resolved bass energy. Pretty cool.
 
I don't find the Amp itself to offer a "cold", "warm", or "neutral" signature, as my sound overall is still giving me a great soundstage, lots of depth, and a wonderful sense that these planar cans are beautifully transparent whether given a difficult and complex song or a simple one. Vocals are still beautifully rendered. Their are no weird pops or noises whether plugging in, or switching to battery, nor is there a noticeable shift in perceived volume (power). What mostly happens is I resist the urge to crank it!
 
The HE 400s are definitely a more fatiguing can, but they are a better can amped than not amped, especially if you are using a lower voltage source (like me). I suspect that some improvement might be found in bypassing the laptop altogether, and using an ODAC would offer a good DAC with, more importantly, a 2Vrms output which could no doubt further reduce the opportunity for noise to enter into HDR recordings. It may also unlock a smidge of volume I may currently be missing (or introduce clipping). But even with some Chopin on, the amp is very "black".
 
I cannot close this review with the claim that the O2 has all the power you would ever want, nor would I claim that my headphones are absolutely better. But the amp is certainly doing its job, and I am very pleased.

Power to you brother, I find on-board sound to be quite adaquete for the Hifimans. They live up to the claim that they can be driven by most common gear.
 
Check out my long-ass recent posts though. If you ever listen to music / movies via DVDs, or if you indulge "high quality" (uncompressed - not in the Mp3 sense, but literally recorded with little compression) or recordings with High Dynamic Range, the HE-400 will reward you for an amp with more power like the O2. It seems to have given me a little "bass boost" to boot. I think the amp just handles the load a bit better than my on board sound could. Coming from me, that's saying a lot, as I resist a lot of equipment hype.
 
Cans like the HE-400 will definitely reward you for stepping up your source. Just try switching from a common Mp3 player, to your comp, to some higher quality source if you can. These things have some resolution spare. I can't really say the same for my other phones', which are fairly consistent from source to source.

Hey Jerg, I pretty much wrote it for you. What I found killer, was that the HD595s actually sounded "leaner" to me this time around, as the HE-400 bass response picked up to the point where the HD's lack of "sub bass" performance became somewhat more apparent to me. The apparent mid-bass advantage of the HD595s was missing this time around, and they sounded worse the louder I took them. I wasn't expecting that at all. In fact, the HD's now seemed quite outclassed across the range. They are still like pillows on my head compared to the HEs though, so comfortable.
 
On treble, I feel that nothing really changed. I haven't caught a "tizziness" when listening. Again, I may have lost some objectivity as my ears have become better acclimated to the HEs. Norah has not "hurt" me quite as much off this amp, but I overall feel more fatigued a bit sooner than I recall. It could be from just exploring the new power and blasting my ears today at times. I would claim that the HE's still seem well controlled and very smooth, and falls just shy of edgy to my ears.
 
I have not attempted an EQ tuning yet, but beforehand, was targeting 1 khz by about 3 db and surrounding freqs by about 1.5-2 dB. I also Started at 2.5khz or so and dragged down all upper freqs by about 2 dB through 10 khz. That tamed the treble a little, but this is still a pretty "hot" treble as far as I am concerned. I feel less need to EQ on the new amp, and may actually go after mid bass slighting, the mids again, and focus on trimming the higher end. I am also curious about "correcting" the big dip in the 2 khz range to see if that might smooth some of the mid response even more. Mainly, I'd strive for an objective flattening of the response first, and failing that, try to tweak to something that works a little better at lower volumes, which is where I should be listening! To my ears, that means targeting the upper end of response for a haircut, to bring the mids and bass a little more forward.
 
Identify some of the tracks you think this tizziness occurs. Perhaps I'll have them already, and can give it a listen.

OK so I found a very decently priced amplifier that works well with my setup. It's called the Sense G5 hybrid amplifier. It really helps to roll off the treble that most complain about. I got it for ~$150 from this seller:
http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Wholesale-Free-Shipping-Sense-G5-Hybrid-Vacuum-Tube-Headphone-Amplifier-Brand-New/537708912.html

It took over a week to get it to me with EMS shipping. It sounds better with the Hot Audio Dac Extasy than the F17, E09K, and O2. The only problem I'm having is that after about an hour I hear this constant high pitched whine sound come through the headphones, even when the volume is turned all the way down. (Ground Loop maybe?). So after I turn off the unit, take out the tubes and wait 30 minutes or so and put the tubes back in. Annoying sound disappears.

First impression on the HD650 (music only)...
It's GREAT! If there is a veil, I'm definitely not hearing it. Treble is plentiful for me, the vocals are oh so lovely, and it has a very natural tone. More natural than the Q701.
The bass is nice too! It's not as fun as the DT990, but it's definitely nice. The main star is definitely those mids.
I'm absolutely, completely, and pleasantly surprised. I really thought I wouldn't like them. I couldn't have been more wrong.
Don't have the HE400 to compare, but I can tell the HD650 has better mids, and the treble doesn't get peaky like it did on the HE400.
That being said, if I could only own one headphone between the two, I prefer the HE400 overall. It has that planar goodness that the HD650 can't capture.
For my own use though, the HD650 makes a better complimentary can to the DT990 than the HE400. Those mids are special. The HE400 can't touch the HD650 there.
And yes, I absolutely LOVE the HE400. That honeymoon never ended. It's my 2nd fave can after the D7000. I just have very particular needs that neither the D7000 nor the HE400 fulfilled completely. The 990 has the bass I want, and the HD650 has the natural sound, and lovely vocals. The D7000 was too hot and sticky, and the HE400 was nearly perfect just missing a bit on bass for my music needs, and vocals while great, aren't as good as the HD650's.
Oh yes, the HD650 is the most beautiful headphone I have owned (outside of the ES7).Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/6/12 at 10:37am

This is where "hi-fi" audio separates from pro-audio mentality (or even speakers to a large degree.)   In pro, the ideal gear is a near-flat source, near-flat amp, near-flat speaker.  Then you EQ to correct the room and the equipment anomalies to bring it to dead-flat, and then apply further EQ to customise the signature.  In hi-fi everyone ones the EQ pre-done on the gear to suit their needs.  Of course with headphones, the FRs are so all over the board that few headphones really handle being EQ'd very well, and HE-400 is not one of the shining examples in that department.  It helps, but it's not perfect. 
 
Though I hear you with not all sources having EQ available, and that does present an issue.  But I don't consider EQ "cheating" so much as adding another layer of control to the system. 
 

 
MLE should just admit it.  He needs TH-900..... 
 

 
Your impressions of HD650 seem spot on to me!  In terms of "planar goodness" I also agree somewhat, though I think the presentation of each has different strengths and weaknesses.  It depends on genre.  HD650 just can't do classical piano with half the justice HE-400 gives it.  HE-400 just can't do world music with half the justice HD650 gives it.  That's a hard contest between those two....

I haven't heard the HD600/HD650 yet. But that's soon to change, as I ordered the HD600 recently to compare to the HE400 that is also on the way soon (second time trying). I am expecting a "veil", but purely based upon the HD598 that I've had a bit of time with. That thing sounds, well, veiled in the treble. It literally sounds like a curtain is between you and the band playing on-stage. Granted, it was out of a Fiio E7, which might've been a poor pairing.
That said, I wanted to try the HD600 now that I have a decent amp, since from what I've read I'll probably like the HD600 more than the HD650 as I tend to prefer a slightly more neutral bass presentation (e.g. I don't like DT990 or PS500). I'll match them against the HE400 and a Wood Magnum V4 Build already on its way (international shipping). All these headphones are roughly in the $400 price range, and should all be quite different. To top it all off, I'll be borrowing a pair of HE500 to throw in the mix of comparisons. I'm stoked!
I expect to like the HE500 best. And that's based primarily on this: I really loved everything about the HE400 when I tried it, except the mids / vocals. From what I've read, HE500 is similar but with better mids. Not sure what to expect from the Magnum V4 Build and the HD600, as I've had no exposure to either yet!

If by "uncompressed" collection you mean that you are listening to high dynamic range recording, I am sure a decent amp will improve performance overall, mainly by providing additional volume which might not be possible right now.
 
I would consider a DAC if you felt that the one you use currently (in your computer), to be brief, sucked. Mine sounds very good to my ears, everything is realistic, and it can handle up to a blu-ray format (24-bit 192 khz). That said, the overwhelming amount of music out there is still 16-bit 44.1 khz. Unless you have a DAC which is noisy I am not sure its worth it. Your ears "can't" necesarily hear the difference between different DACs. There may be an advantage however, in removing all the sound processing from your computer. In my case, there are a few static pops and some hissing at very high volume under some conditions. But that is a 1% observation, and not really a problem to be solved.
 
I'd probably withhold from investing in a DAC until you are satisfied that you have the power and the sound you want. I wouldn't buy one that didn't spec relatively well, or better than my amp. The goal is to maximize Signal to Noise, channel separation, and so on. Also, most DACs I see so far, tailored to headphones, don't even put out much line voltage. I wouldn't settle for less than about 2Vrms, which I think could help maximize signal to noise and drive amps well. In my case, I may spring for an ODAC later which is the match to my new O2 amp. My knock against it is that it can accept USB or USB+RCA, but it lacks a digital input. This limits its applications a bit, which I don't prefer. It is also $150 bucks, which is a lot. I may instead just shop for a CD player or something which can do the same job.

No. I LOVE the HE400's mids. They're very natural. They're not forward or recessed to my ears. They're well in tune with the rest of the sound spectrum. They're not missing much, honestly. The only other headphone I have owned where I could say I thought the mids were better, was the ESW9 (which had overly smooth treble, IMHO).
Don't worry about the HE400's mids. They're stellar. If they were more forward, you'd lose that good bass they have.
If I could only own ONE, the HE400 >>>>>> HD650. The HE400 is between what I want that my 990 has, and what the HD650 has. So yes, they're the best all rounder I have owned. The only reason I'd keep the HD650 over the HE400 is because I already have the 990 for my bassy, and energetic music needs. The HE400 doesn't have as much bass for me, but if it did, the HE400 would be the ONLY can I'd need.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/6/12 at 12:13pm

Guys i think some of you may have taken my question about the poorly recorded music the wrong way. I didn't mean lossy vs lossless/uncompressed, i meant poorly recorded and mastered in the studio vs vise versa.
 
For example i have the Alice in Chains MTV Unplugged flac album on my computer. It's recorded absolutely masterfully. Plenty of dynamic range, extremely detailed, never harsh etc etc. In comparison i have a flac file by Lady Gaga (don't ask) taken from one of her newer albums. It can sometimes be harsh and looking at the file's waveform there's some serious clipping and not much dynamic range. This is typical for almost all modern music.
 
I just wanted to know if the HE400 would reveal the pitfalls of the mastering and make the music un-enjoyable as a result, much like what i've about the HD800 from Senn. People say it absolutely destroys poorly recorded music, or maybe poorly recorded music destroys the HD800

LOL. As I sit here plugged in to my O2, listening to Chopin and thinking about this post, I can't help but laugh at the way people convince themselves that there is an equipment problem and not a human problem going on. The O2 "reduces" euphonic pleasure? Not nearly as much as listening to crappy songs!
 
What you need to do is set up some double blind testing conditions, and just sit there, and fail at them. Its a wonderful feeling to know that you can't identify different amps, cables, and DACs like you think you can. Even better when you realize you can't hear the difference in an Mp3 versus CD. Once that is settled, you can go back to just loving your music and enjoying the different sounds of your phones'
 
The only thing the O2 did for me was give my HEs the power they deserved, and they sounded a little better, not a little worse. My HD595s didn't really benefit from the amp at all, my ears like the HE's so much at this point the 595s just sound grainy and confused in comparison.
 
The only thing I can't stand about the HE-400, which keeps them from perfection, is the ear fatigue I get from them. I figure its either the clamp/pads wearing down my head, or the somewhat aggressive treble messing with me.

=============================================

I never-ever write formal reviews--I just hate having to formally organize my thoughts on any level, but I love the HE-400 so much, I could not suppress an Evangelical like urge to "Spread the word." I'll post my review tomorrow on Amazon, after I had a chance to proofread it, but I feel it's only right that I post it here first: 
 
 
The HE400 may quite possibly be the best headphones you can buy south of 600 dollars. For a paltry $399, you  get a hearty sampling of high-fidelity. The He-400's bass, for example, is some of the best I've heard; it's textured, powerful, and extends to 30Hz with great verve, and it does this without detracting  from the all-essential mid-range or the HE400's linear character.  I should stress, however, that the HE-400's bass, though quite powerful, is not exaggerated in any way; there is no extra emphasis in the mid-bass either, so if you're a die-heard bass head be warned: the HE-400 is most certainly not for you.
 
What surprised me the most about the HE-400 though has to be its holographic presentation: with the right recordings, music can become downright ethereal. I  sometimes feel as if I've been transported into a virtual space where music is allowed to seduce my senses, not just from the traditional left and right orientation, but rather from every direction of the compass.  Again, I should stress: this happens mostly with really well mastered, high-quality recordings--Fever Ray, for example, or Andrew Bird, and, of course, I shouldn't forget Pink Floyd. If, however, you listen to poor quality media with these headphones, they won't sound at all special. Seriously! The old rule, "Garbage in, garbage out," most assuredly applies here.
 
Which brings me to the HE-400's only weakness: the treble. With poorly master/ low-bit rate media, in particular, the treble can be a little wince-worthy, in part, because of the HE-400's rather aggressive treble peak at 9Khz, but also because this peak is juxtaposed to the HE-400's most peculiar attribute: its upper-midrange recession. (See headroom graph @ headroom.com for a visual of this.) 
 
Now,  while this recession may, from time to time,  shift your auditory focus toward the HE-400's treble hot spot, it tends to more frequently shift your focus in the opposite direction.  As a consequence, everything below 900Hz acquires extra depth and texture. Take Leonard Cohen's new album for example: Old Ideas. Leonard's voice is portrayed with mind-boggling realism and presence: it's almost too real! All my other headphones (the Sennheiser HD650, the Denon D2000, the AKG Q701 and K550, just to name a few) cannot fully capture this realism: the man's voice is so gravelly and yet so full of nuances, and only the HE-400 has enough low-end depth and resolution to do the man justice.
 
Anyway, I've said enough, but I should note one final thing: the HE-400 needs adequate power to shine; most mp3 players just won't cut it. Do yourself a favor and buy a good headphone amp. Your headphones will love you for this.

I never implied an equipment problem over a human problem.  I believe I stated that the result was for "my tastes" which is pretty specifically a human issue. However, I would counter the second statement by saying that, while you may not be able to hear differences between amps in a blind test (yet), there are many, many of us who can.  O2, like most "pro audio" gear, Auditor, etc, has a rather distinctly clinical presentation.  It's precisely the absence of the types of "flaws" such as warmth, smoothness, etc that makes it a less pleasurable listen for most gear (though it's worth saying that I prefer that presentation with the D5000, which is already highly colored.)  I can assure you that there is no way I could mistake HE-400 on O2 for HE-400 on Lyr, or mistaking HE-400 on Lyr with my Matsu tubes versus my Tungsram tubes.  Blind, non-blind or otherwise, any more than I could mistake HE-400 for HD650. I understand your point and what you're trying to drive at, but it's too broad and ultimately inaccurate as written. 
 
Regarding MP3s versus CDs it very definitely depends on the particular music and what bitrate is being discussed.  Too low a bitrate and MP3, specifically of all the compression types, develops a very metallic sounding treble.  The trouble with MP3 is certain frequency bands are entirely missing (as in, chopped out.)  Always the same bands (which is where MP3 specifically pales next to other formats such as Vorbis, and, grudgingly, AAC.) A 320kbps MP3, I'd concur there's really no audible difference (though keeping in mind there are frequency bands that are still missing.)  256k it depends.  There are many recordings I can hear no difference.  There are some more complicated (from a frequency perspective) tracks where a difference can be heard. Anything below 256k and the terrain gets a lot rockier very fast. AAC holds its own below 256k pretty well actually, as does vorbis.  Unfortunately so few hardware players support vorbis it's problematic, and it's a CPU/energy hog on portable devices.
 
I'd also counter that the "treble fatigue" issue is made worse by the very "cold" (i.e. flat, without warming) O2.  Or, perhaps "made worse" is the wrong wording, but rather, is made more obvious by not being reduced.  There's nothing wrong with a "cold" amp, of course.  The factor is the human one: is it preferable for one's tastes.

I believe you Madmollusk - if we are talking about the difference between a Zune, a Clip+, and a $1000 amp/DAC combo. I know my cell phone isn't that good, I know my clip is better, I know I prefer the computer/amp combo for the power hungry HE-400s to a nook tablet (and would every time). But it is a dispassionate combination. Your subjective experience of each would very likely change under blind conditions also - rendering slight changes in hardware much less important than they seem. Case in point: I had to concede that the 400s sounded way better to me on a sh**ty clip than my very fancy cell phone! It was funny. Then again, why the hell would you invest in awesome headphones and not make sure you had a decent source?
 
Story: A guy at an audio shop was baffled that I wouldn't buy a JL Amp over an Alpine Class D because "class D is noisy" and "Alpine has no bass". But knowledge is power - the Alpine is under-rated, it is very efficient (and small), with very very low noise. From a technical standpoint, it was a good match for the speakers I wanted to power. The JL, at twice the price, would not come even close to being twice the sound (even though sure, I'd buy it if I could afford it). This is mainly because it put out approximately the same wattage.
 
The real problem between a lot of amps / equipment is the difference between RATED specs and ACTUAL. Too many companies B.S. their way past consumers, hence the notion that "JL's 300 watt" amp sounds amazing compared to "U.S. Acoustics junk". No, the real problem is that the JL is underrated at makes about 400 watts rms (easily driving your sub without distortion), while the U.S. acoustics does 300 watts MAX and provides 150 watts RMS, just barely meeting your speaker's requirement. But a watt is a watt and 99% of the time, you would NOT know the difference between a JL watt and a U.S. acoustic watt. Yet we stick to the "good brands" because we are assured of a more consistent quality experience. Also, I love my Kenwood deck, but despise its high impedance RCA pre-outs. It has been very hard to find the right gain settings to avoid noise / maximize volume. Today's AUX and USB outputs, offering subtle differences in source / amp matching add another layer of complication I find annoying.
 
Anyway, I am picking on you for your apparent dissatisfaction with a good piece of equipment (the O2) - I do not believe that it can add, nor take away from your subjective experience of a great pair of headphones. That is only something you can do. Technically, the O2 is nothing but a half-to-maybe-3/4 watt amplifier with good signal to noise. Technically, your "inferior" devices are either not music first, or not optimized for awesome planars. That they don't work as well as "dedicated" amps like the O2 is absolutely NO surprise to me. Yet I would not claim that the O2 was more / less clinical than my less powerful laptop amp was. All I concede is that, yes, the extra power seems to be appreciated by the headphones (in similar manner that I can "hear" the difference between my car subwoofer powered by 100 watts RMS and 200 watts RMS - provided the sub can handle it). I always seek to have enough power to achieve X-max, as that is the best you can really do.
 
I am quickly learning that, in the headphone world, one is subject to the same problems as every other audio space - too little ACTUAL ratings for equipment, and too much B.S. and market positioning. Considering the massive expense on some stuff, its ludicrous. Even the O2 exceeds the price of many-a-great car amplifier, which I find annoying.
 
Anyway, once more: Assuming a double blind test between relatively comparable pieces of audio equipment, you will likely fail to love the most expensive, and possibly even the technically "superior" equipment. I would put my sansa up against an iPhone any day. It would be fascinating to see the results. I would also put the O2 up against a $1500 dollar Harman-Kardon receiver.  I am just trying to relieve you, brutha - if you aren't satisfied, don't blame the least-likely-to-affect-SQ equipment first (AMP DAC). You are smart enough to know you've selected the right equipment for your phones. Get pissed at the recording or the speakers first!

There are also schizophrenics on the street certain that they can hear voices that I can't, what's your point? Its impossible to prove without testing that 2 humans can (or can't) hear the same difference. If those humans are trained to listen for specific issues, than a test would be even more important - because now its harder to differentiate preferences based on what they hear, from preferences based on what they know (bias). I can hear differences between equipment too, so I guess I can't just dismiss the "golden ears" of some from my ordinary ears. I wouldn't buy this stuff if I wasn't so sure it would make me happy. 
 
But seriously, perception aside, most of the differences between your amps are only measured in the lab. If an amp is rolling off treble or bass response, that's not "warmth" or "darkness" to me - that's a technical failure to do a specific job, which is: replicate the audible spectrum without perceivable distortion. I guess the issue is that I just don't buy that the O2 is "just a tool" while other amps are emotionally gratifying and capable of imparting a "special" tonality or reverence for music. I'm adding that it might be liberating to do a blind test and see what your preferences might be - since you seem to be saying you like distorting your music at each level of the signal chain. Given that recordings and reproduction equipment are already distorting reality, this is quite interesting.
 
There is enough variety of source and equipment out there to achieve slightly different presentations, I get that. But I would love to see the objective measures between amps and measured impact on headphone frequency response and so on. Because sometimes I see the variation in equipment as a major problem, not a benefit, of "high end" audio. For example, someone blows $400 dollar on some cans, doesn't really like them, and starts using 10 different amps hoping they can color the sound "just right". That's not fun - that's torture!

I really don't get your point. Are you trying to argue that the o2 is a respectable amp. In fact, it's nothing that you really need to clarify or support. Most of us who have been here a while and have listened to it would agree that the o2 is in fact a respectable amp. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately depending on your perspective, "respectable" is not an adjective that most of us would use to describe the experience that we after in the enjoyment of this hobby. 
 
I auditioned an o2 shortly after they came out and found it quite disappointing. Shortly after, I bought a lyr and have been happy with my amp choice since that point and feel no need to upgrade or change at this point. The o2, to me, sounds "thin." The instrument separation is mediocre and the bass is rolled off. The o2 did nothing for the he400 or the hd650 for that matter that lead to my enjoyment of listening to reproduced music. Furthermore, the decay of notes was not there making the music seem even more artificial and clinical. 
 
But hey if it's your cup of tea, then enjoy. Just because you hear things one way doesn't mean that anyone will agree with you.

+1.  Debates starting with the premise of "I don't think you're hearing what you think you're hearing" typically don't end well for a thread, at least not outside the sound science forum.  We're all guilty of making assumptions about gear we have not personally owned from time to time, but at least can offer commentary based on similar competing gear, or evaluation based on the posted measurements when we make such reaches.  So far this is pointing toward a more broad generalization of subjective vs objective results discussion about gear pairings that have not been evaluated by all parties.  It's a valid discussion, but more for the sound science forum.
 
If the conversation is about whether the O2 pairs well with HE-400, we have a few people who agree that they dislike it for the same reasons, and a few who disagree and happen to like it.  That's appropriate conversation here, certainly.  But if it's dipping into broader ideas about "amp doesn't matter they all sound the same" or "amps that don't measure flat are flawed designs" or that type of discussion, we're getting more into "amp purchase theory" which is its own thing entirely. 
We certainly don't want the thread locked!

You said it better than me.
 
I'm not trying to hate on anyone, I'm just saying that actual exhaustive testing is only going to prove one thing: A) That you probably don't like "colored" sound nearly as much as you think you do and B) There is a very good chance you will pick the O2 just as often as you pick some other comparable amp, assuming performance differences are not clearly night and day.
 
All of this is not meant to attack anyone's belief that they can in fact hear a difference that matters to them. Like Chewy said, however, there is a significant likelihood that the only real difference between product A and product B is going to be a difference your wallet can feel. The rest is marketing. Would I always spend more if I could? Probably. But 90% of the time it will be on better speakers, since that is only decision that should matter. Because there are not real standards in this industry, we are all forced to "guess" which products are really delivering the goods, and which aren't.

I've received the HE-400 today, and I would say that my first impressions were not as great as yours. Something was wrong with them. To my ears the mids seemed veiled compared to the rest of the spectra, I heard voices like behind a thin wall. They were here but not clear and had no impact (especially vs the HD650).
After few hours (burned-in the whole afternoon), this feeling went off and it's a relief to be honest. :)
 
Imo, quality wise, the HE-400 are on par with my D7000 (except the bass) and I find them better than the HD650 overall (maybe the HD650 are smoother and more fun-sounding). That's only my point of view after few hours of listening.
The details are amazing, I've recognised instruments in a song that I've not been aware off before... (too bad I didn't find a link on youtube.)
Oh, and I'm amping them with the Burson HA-160D.
I hope I will have time to do a better review, and It will be a good training for my English ! :).

There is a bit of a burn-in change at least on many pairs.  Some folks haven't experience this though.  In the broader sense though, are you using the velour pads or the pleather pads that came with them?  The pleather tends to underdamp the sound which can lead to that "thin wall" sound in the mids, or "sucked in" mids as they have been called.  IF you haven't yet, I think most of us here would strongly suggest ordering a pair of the velour pads (which are actually cheaper than the pleather), and even if you've adapted to like the sound of the HE-400, you'll probably like them even more with the velour.  They become much more linear!
 
HD650 and HE-400 are very good complements to each other.  HE-400 is the bassier and technically more "fun" (which usually means a more v or u-shaped curve), HD650 being the warmer, smoother one.  Where HD650 excells with a coherent center soundstage, HE-400 excells in excellent instrument separation, as you're already discovering!

Hey, now, be fair!  I've never made an explicit statement about the O2, nor did I ever imply that I disliked it. I have no opinion about that amp whatsoever: you see, I've never heard it, so how could I have an opinion about it. You posted the o2's specs, and the specs look good to me, so I'm not sure where any of this is coming from. So if that's true, I obviously never said, or implied, that my Kenwood was superior to your amp. But my kenwood is better than my little dot though and that's what I compared it to. So again where is this coming from?  Be fair with me now. With regard to your general premise about a/b testing and amps, I agree with you--more than you can possibly know (I'm sort of a general science enthusiast), but you do realize that those famous a/b tests (floating around on the web) are highly highly flawed, as are most so-called blind audio tests. Let me rephrase that: those tests (again the ones I've seen) are scientifically disgraceful. Especially the ones I've seen on you tube and other online places. in fact, they are conducted so poorly I can hardly believe it sometimes. My goodness, where are the controls people! Scientific testing requires robust controls to filter out extraneous influences. Ever hear of "audio steering?" No test, I've ever seen controls for that. Peer pressure? Again no test, I've seen, controls for that either. In fact most of the test I've seen don't even have controls for room acoustics, listening location, and hearing variation with their test subjects. Come-on now, you have to control for that kind of stuff, big time! What about expectation bias--do these blind test control for that?  (Many of them really don't!)  I'm just saying, I love the double blind test as much as you do, but most of these so-called audio test are not even double blind!!  That really kills me. What about stress induced by limited time for evaluations? (This really could be a factor!) So I agree with you: double blind testing is the only way to falsify much of the audio voodoo out there, but these tests need to be conducted properly, and then they need to be peer reviewed and that cycle needs to be repeated as many times as required. I'm not sore here. I sure hope I don't sound sore. if I do, I sincerely apologize.

It's come to my understanding that amps can still sound vastly different, even when all of them measure perfectly flat from 20-20k on a frequency response chart, and all have similar distortion characteristics.  Don't ask me why, but there's other factors involved.
 
This isn't the first time I've heard someone say the O2's bass is rolled off or sounded too thin for them.  Yet at the same time, the epitome of subjective reviewers at Headfonia loved the HE-400 with O2, despite disliking the O2's sound in general.  I'm sure 90% of it boils down to personal preference, MLE giving his own perfect example.  Whitecrow has also said he didn't think the Lyr did anything better on the HE-400 compared to a LDMKII, the likes of which I had and ever so slightly preferred the O2 over.
 
As for the HE-400 sounding better over time, 100% it's brain burn-in.  It can be such a dramatically different signature than most other headphones, and if you'e coming off something with the slightest hint of brightness or thin-ness, the HE-400 can easily sound muffled upon first listen.  It definitely did for me, and I was coming from an HD650!  It only took me an hour or two to adjust, and the HE-400 quickly became my neutral again.

Hmm... Not TOO sure if Peter will do it, but I see why you want to do it. For the HE-6 right? Speaker taps? With DHC, you get what you pay for, and surprisingly more than what you pay for IMO. Peter is VERY talented and his creations are considered works of art IMO. For instance, I was the first CUSTOMER to buy the DHC Symbiote SE (check out the first picture of the Symbiote SE on his site. That's my exact cable! Black and clear with a right angled Oyaide gold jack!). I'm not going to debate with anyone about cables because chances are I'm going to stir up a lot of arguments, but I am a believer in cables. Check out my impressions on the DHC appreciation thread if you're curious. Also, this might stir up an argument so please refrain from arguing, BTG doesn't use OCC copper while DHC does.

I am lost myself. I think my original comment went to IEMCrazy and somehow, getting mixed into the conversation, I went after you when I meant IEMCrazy. So I guess I am the crazy one. Sorry for the confusion, and sorry to IEM if I was way off base. I just made the mistake of thinking I could convince someone that it makes more sense to focus on phones' than other equipment, other things being equal.
 
BTW great post - I really appreciate and respect your perspective on audio. To the problem of eliminating variables in a double-blind test, that is what stat regression is for - presumably you can estimate the impact of one factor against "all other known factors". Then again you might want to "test" people's bias by showing them 4 amps with 4 different cases, ranging from plain to super-high-quality. With the exact same internals, you then ask them which sound they like best. You've polluted the test, because people are now "forced" to rank, so perhaps they all go with the best looking one. I would be surprised if many responded "they all sound the same." But you also let them in on a little secret afterward - you really will pay more for a look sometimes. It would be hard to do double-blind tests with headphones because they have different shapes / sizes / weight / comfort, and a respondent has a good chance of being familiar with the look and feel of a given model. I think the HE's would've flunked my ears in a blind test - primarily because I am used to a "sennheiser" presentation. How would we account for that? The basic point is that people (consumers in this case), are conditioned to look for, and identify differences constantly. We are also given s*** information. Those of us here, that obviously love music to the point of investing $1,000s in equipment / phones, should get the best information as well as the best products! It is frustrating (to me) that so much is left to subjective impression - because I don't trust myself to always "know with my ears".
 
Case in point? The more I listen to the HE-400s, the more I like them. The HD595 now seriously sound like s*** - but its not their fault. My ears have "adjusted" to the new presentation. The 400s were lean, not they are borderline too powerful for me. But I don't call that "burn-in" - I think its my brain screwing with me again.
 

Thanks for your support! I keep forgetting that in this crowd, their is a wicked diversity of equipment and listening experience. I am sure that tube amps have their amazing properties. There wouldn't be a market for em' if people didn't like em'. I suppose I was being defensive of my own gear, or at least trying to remind people that, if anything, audio would be a lot less aggravating if there was a more consistent standard to the listening experience!
 
That said, I know I am just as guilty, if not more, of buying other stuff just for the sake of it - I like audio to the point that I WANT to screw with my sound (so far every 3-5 years). Without you guys, I'd have never heard of the HE-400, or the Objective 2. So thanks to all of you.

Just received my he-400 from justin (headamp). It took almost 10 days to reach my shore (Malaysia).
 
I am listening to it right now with just a 16bit usb dac and no amp. It is already loud enough for me and now i am doubting whether should i get an amp or not lol.
 
My first impression on this headphones without burning in is that they almost everything i wanted. I initially wanted a ms2i (upgrading from a ms1i) but i find it too forward sounding and so i decided to check out hifiman's offering. According to what i have read, technically it should be what i wanted but i find out that he-400 is not as forward sounding as i wanted it to be lol but i will eventually get used to it so it is all good i guess. Btw i can actually feel the weight of this headphone lol but i guess it is just a matter of time before i get used to it . So overall i am satisfied with my purchase :)

I just listened to a few tracks on youtube; it's not the best album for stressing the he-400 strengths but it sounds fine to me. Your experience with the he-400 is so contrary to most peoples (I know, I've said this before), that I'm inclined to think that your headphones are defective. Either that are you have discovered a subjective oddity: an odious sound signature that at every frequency assaults your sense of what music should sound like. I know the latter possibility sounds a little far-fetched but this happened to me a few years ago with the Shure 440, which, by most peoples estimates, are "great little headphones for the price." I exchanged my first pair because I just knew they had to be defective-- guess what? They weren't! What others loved, even adored, grated at my ears and soured my mood every time I used them. It was the most wretched headphone experience of my life.

Yeah that 650 graph Purrin posed was a big surprise to me.  Up until the moment I saw it on his site, I kept wondering why I was hearing the specific pair of 650 I had to be so flat until the extremes, and then the graph showed me the 650 is capable of being just that.   I dunno if the differences between the two 650 he posted are due to pads alone, or different drivers etc, but the second one definitely sounded more along the lines of what I heard them as, although the bass in mine took a nosedive after 50hz or so.
 
This was the subjective graph I had made prior to seeing Purrin's graph, comparing HD-650, D2000 and HE-400, and the 650 graph more or less agreed with Purrin's.
 

 
 
The measurements of the Rabid-Dog HD800 on Purrin's site though looks very intriguing.  If it could be paired nicely with a warm sounding amp, I wouldn't mind eventually having one.
 
As for Purrin's graphs looking corrected and not raw, I think they strike a nice balance between the actual raw results and corrected results as shown on inner fidelity.  If you look at inner fidelity's raw graphs, then HE-400 would be the most neutral.

Here's my two cents on the subject of headphones and neutrality. Neutrality may just be a moving target, or put another way, a relationship between an individuals hearing capacity and a given headphones frequency response (all recording variables aside for the moment). My hearing terminates rudely at 17khz, my father's hearing terminates at around 7khz (he's going deaf, the poor guy), and my wife claims to hear 20khz. But, of course, that's not the end of the story; some folks have denser or sparser clusters of hair cells in their cochlear, which increases or decreases sensitivity to certain frequencies. Also, if permitted a little latitude, I would say that ears are a little like acoustic chambers, and no two people have identical ear anatomies. So one persons  sense of "neutral" most certainly will vary from the next persons, depending on a whole host of inherent sensitivities. If you ask me (or even if you don't ) this explains why so many people hear headphones so freaking differently.  And then, of course, there's the highly personal way we all define words like "neutral," but that's another subject altogether.

My thoughts after 2 hours of comparing odac and msII with O2 as amp and HE-400 as reference.
 
First, with pink noise.  This will show tonality differences between the two dacs moreso than anything else, regardless if their fr measurements are the same.  MSII is slightly more aggressive and peaky around 8khz while odac is slightly smoother.
 
Low tones played in audacity, to show their bass extension capabilities. They both performed the same.
 
Now with music.  I've only used one hans zimmer piece and one rush piece for a good hour now, and the differences are subtle enough to the point that I wouldn't be confident to tell much of a difference in a blind test.  The odac seems a bit softer around the edges overall, but that's about all I can make out.  I'm not going to bother spending more time trying to compare them because it's mostly fruitless.
 
 
 
My conclusion: buy whichever one is the better deal at the time, they both perform very close to each other.

DAC differences = lol. I'm more of a believer that once you get to a certain point, it's all gonna sound basically the same.
Hell, I wasn't able to tell the diff between a $26 Fiio D3 vs the NFB-5's more robust DAC vs the E17. The differences were so slight, it wasn't even worth mentioning. Then comparing the E17 to the ODAC felt the same too. It was so subtle, I thought it was a waste of money to go up even higher than that. Magic rainbows better come slam into my ears compared to the standard good quality sound I hear out of all the DACs I've heard.
People just choose to hear what they wanna hear, and expect a more expensive DAC to sound better. I'm very critical, and I don't find it worthwhile to go up higher than what I have. A waste of money if you ask me. I can hear differences in an amp more than out of a DAC.
It's a scam if you ask me, personally.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/9/12 at 8:32am

I've found that when comparing the MSII to the ODAC with a bright headphones it's much harder to determine the difference. When using a very dark or closed headphone that's bassy, it's quite easy.
 
I would say that my MSII was much more revealing of my garbage tracks. For some reason if i'd listen to my very harsh/fatiguing Jpop it was much worse on the MSII. On the ODAC it was made a little more bearable. The MSII might very well measure flat, but it did seem to sound like it has some weird peaks in the upper mids or maybe some area of the treble. I didn't analyze the differences enough since I liked the ODAC a lot more almost immediately.
 
The MSII made my HD-600/598 sound a bit warmer, but yet a tiny bit more muffled. Maybe this is why the SRH-940 I test sounded "slightly warm". I couldn't figure out why my DJ100 sounded so strange with my setup and it was the MSII. These are minor differences and the MSII is still good.
 
I've also found the soundstage of the MSII to be quite small. I always blamed my amp, but that definitely wasn't it. The soundstage of my Q701 increases in size a little bit with the ODAC.
 
My impression of the ODAC is that it's pretty smooth and doesn't try to do anything. It also doesn't make any of my headphones different than they should be (MSII did somewhat). My Q701 didn't suddenly became even more analytical. I actually don't find the ODAC to be ultra revealing or anything like that. Entirely depends more on the headphone.
 
I still think the treble on my ODAC reminds of that of the PS1 (SCPH-1001), weird I know. The Q701 is now less fatiguing with bad material than before. Never would have imagined that..
 
So best way to tell the difference between the two for me is load up all your worse harsh/fatiguing garbage tracks and compare

Hmm, I've always heard more than subtle difference between budget DACs. I think when comparing $100+ DACs, the difference would be not that much different maybe. I just know that I found the E10 and Nuforce Icon Mobile awful as DACs for SOME headphones. E10 was ok for the Q701, but terrible for the HD-598 (IMO). For me the difference between the MSII and ODAC isn't really subtle. You can take a list of a dozen songs and easily tell the difference. It really depends on the music. With some very good recordings there will probably be no difference. The Q701 is just so much smoother with the ODAC. I was expecting the total opposite.
 
I think when comparing the E10 to the ODAC with the Q701, the difference would be harder to spot. I don't know why it's so hard to determine DAC differences with the Q701! With my DJ100 it's stupid easy.
 
When comparing the ODAC to MSII it doesn't require bombarding your ears with garbage tracks. This is the quickest way to hear the differences though. The ODAC just sounds smoother with any headphone and is less likely to change the sound of my headphone. Of course some prefer the HRT MSII signature for some very mild coloration. It's a bit warmer and darker than the ODAC perhaps.
 
 
Another bizarre thing I've noticed is that some amps are less revealing of what DAC is connected to it. Why? I have no clue. With my Micro Amp it's incredibly easy. With my E9...it's quite difficult. With my Micro I can connect my Clip+ up to it and it'll sound like ..well a Clip+ on steroids. I always had a feeling that on some amps the differences between DACs is harder to hear. It's made even harder when not using many different headphones. Some seem less revealing for whatever reason.

It seems to me that with some of the amps i've tried, the differences between DACs are less noticeable.
When I connect my HRT MSII, ODAC or an E10 up to my E9 it's very hard to hear the differences.
The differences between the ODAC and MSII isn't as dramatically different with the E9 as it is with the Micro Amp.
Is it because the E9 is less revealing or transparent? I have no idea and wish I knew why.
 
 
With my Micro (or possibly an O2) it's as if I'm only hearing the DAC.
With every single device I connect up to my Amp, it always changes depending on the sources signature (if it has one).
At one time I was blaming my amp for a specific sound signature, when in fact it was my HRT DAC!
 
Right now i'm really convinced that my setup is not putting any of it's own coloration into my headphones. If so it's very minor.
Of course I don't know if the Micro Amp is as dead neutral and transparent as the O2. Tyll just measured them, but I don't know really if it's more colored than the O2 or not.
 
Maybe with an ultra revealing amp/headphone it's even easier to hear the differences between DACs.
 
I don't have as much experience with amps/dacs as some here, but these are all things i've just noticed and is nothing new to some. Maybe someone can explain these things.
 
It is amusing when i'm describing my amp and I'm instead describing the DAC's sound signature 
Sometimes I also wonder how often people are describing a headphones sound signature, but instead it's just a poor recording confusing them. Like sometimes my Q701 can sound like an AD700 with a bad recording, but more like an HD-600 with a warm recording! It's a bit weird.
 
I'd love to try the Lyr and O2 sometime. Lyr should be nice for my DJ100 and Q701. At least I hope so.
 
Despite what people say, I don't know if all amps sound and measure flat. That hasn't been my experience at all. It seems like if a amp/dac was really flat/neutral it would be fine with every single headphone as long as it has the power to drive it properly. It's weird how all these ruler flat amp/dacs never really sound that way.
 
It's nice not having to worry about amps and dacs anymore. I might get the Lyr sometime just to try something new though. Probably overkill for what I have now though!

Based on your other comments (which I omitted), I am baffled that you came to the conclusion that DAC / Amp combinations make no difference at all. Though, it sounds as though you are either hooking up different DACs to your E9, or hooking up your microamp to the E9, which yes, would alter the sound more, but not because of obvious DAC differences. Is your Microamp and Micro/DAC combo, or just an Amp?
 
Anyway, I don't know of many amps or dacs that measure perfectly flat. What I do know is that, in a lot of cases, many don't measure flat when rendering frequencies outside the audible spectrum (loosely defined as 20 hz - 20 khz). A DAC that is ruler flat through 40 Khz is only going to irritate dogs and bats. Any amp that "rolls" frequencies off at either end of the audible spectrum is a problem for me, as that is always going to alter the sound of a given headphone / song. Though, some people prefer that sort of deliberate "coloration" because they believe in compensates for undesireable qualities (like "too much treble" or "boomy bass").
 
Add in the issue of manufacturers being free to take their own measures and otherwise "hide" the measured performance of their products, and what you have is a world where, most of the time, consumers have to "guess" which products will offer "no fuss" performance so they can just get to the business of enjoying their music. The E9, for example, is an affordable 1-watt amp, but I skipped it because I suspect the O2 I am using instead offers more power to a wider range of headphones.

I'm not sure where you read that or got that idea. I don't believe this actually. I guess my post is a bit all over the place. I 100% totally believe in this thing called amp synergy and that every thing in your setup makes a difference. I also totally believe in amp/dac synergy. I do believe it's easy to NOT like a specific headphone with the wrong amp. Only if the amp is somewhat colored though maybe. I hated the K702 with the Asgard and i'm glad I tried something else. It was also bad with the ATH-AD2000 and K601.
 
I think my goal from now on is to buy only equipment that's very neutral and as transparent as possible. My new rule will be that I don't want my equipment altering how a headphone should sound. I have no problem with people doing this and with some headphones i'd like this. I think my amp/dac should play well with most every headphone and not just with specific headphones.
 
The Headroom Micro is just an amp. I upgraded to it from the Asgard and haven't looked back. I think the only thing on the radar is an O2 for comparison and then a Lyr. I actually might skip a Lyr and just get an HD-650 or something else. Sometime I'd love to try the Matrix M-Stage. I honestly prefer to stick with US built products though.
 
I hated the Asgard with the K702 so much that I ignored people at first that it was not a great match. I tried it with the E9 and was shocked at how much more I liked the K702. I will say the Asgard is amazing with the D2000 and HD-600. The Micro just seems to play well with everything. I actually bought the Micro for the HD-650 and K702. Perfect match for those. The HD-650 is on my radar again now that I have a better DAC. My DAC for the HD-650 was my weakest link at the time.
 
I sure wish some measurements of the Lyr or Asgard were around, but I haven't seen any. I haven't seen any measurements for the ODAC, but it sounds pretty even without it changing how any of my headphones sound. I guess that's what i'm looking for.
 
I think the HRT MSII and E10 might have slightly rolled off treble. Maybe that's why I didn't love the E10 and it was such a poor match for my HD-598 and DJ100? That's my guess. I think the MSII isn't as dark as the E10 though.
 
BTW it's interesting that the E9, M-Stage and Micro all share the same op-amps, but probably couldn't sound any more different! It's interesting that some think that if the opamp is the same, they sound the same.
 
Maybe if I ever get the Lyr it'll make me love the HD-650. I think maybe i'll never love the HD-650. I prefer the 598 and HD-580 by far.

People are either too busy or are pssying out, or a combination of both. Any tweaking or modding on a $400 headphone, especially for people who have never modded before, would seem like a monumental task even if it really isn't.
 
Oh by the way, after some discussion with someone about the longevity of orthodynamic drivers, I was convinced to modify the grill mod further to add dust-proofing, by opening the cup assembly up, and tape a stretched piece of speaker cloth over each driver. I thought having them on right against the driver would mitigate the backwave issue if I have the fabric integrated with the grill distanced away from the driver.
 
Quote from the discussion:
 
"Jerg, you should put some kind of speaker cloth or women's panties on the inside of that grill for dust and dirt protection.  You don't want to get particles into the driver, you'll get rattles from them bouncing around on the diaphragm and could permanently ruin the phones unless you can take the driver apart completely.  And it won't take long for that to happen with them open like that. You will eventually get some dirt in there.  Or let me put it this way, if a lot of people started doing that mod, some of them would wind up with ruined HE500's or HE500's in need of repair.  I have ruined orthos before from leaving bare drivers exposed while I have the cups opened up working on damping schemes. "

The Hifiman headphones are on my radar for sure. I just don't want something so power hungry that it'll require a new amp. They might push my Micro Amp to the limits. Despite how small it is, it drives the 600 ohm Beyers and even the K400/K501 with ease. Not a portable amp, but full desktop amp.
 
I don't know if i'll like the HE-400, but it looks like it's quite a good deal. When I heard that it's fairly laid back and very warm, then that kind of makes me lose interest. I'll admit I don't like very warm headphones. The HD-580 is kind of my limit. Maybe i'm too used to the Sennheiser type of warmth. Is there a difference? 
 
Somehow when I think of a very warm sound, alarms go off in my head that it'll be really muffled sounding, but most likely this will be wrong.
 
Most of my headphones are great for female vocals (I listen to a lot of Jpop, but it's mostly the boring type with female vocals) so maybe the HE-400 is perfect for them. I usually dislike any headphone that has recessed sounding vocals though.
 
Maybe the HE-400 will be the first very warm headphone I love. I think when I sell my house i'll use some of that money to get a Lyr, HE-400 or HD-650 
 
When I get these i'll definitely post a review. Probably will sound totally opposite of the Q701 or HD-598!

Thanks for the very accurate measurements! I saw some on Headroom and they scared me a bit. I love my slightly forward sounding upper mids. Not too forward.
Sometimes when graphs shows weird dips they don't always sound like they have them when I listen to the headphone.
 
My DJ100's graph has a huge dip at just before 5k and then a spike somewhere just after that. I just know that it sounds like it has forward upper mids yet at the same time it's quite forgiving for all my harsh/bright Jpop recordings. Others have said it has tamed lower treble and then emphasized upper treble. I just know it's totally non fatiguing. I imagine the HE-400 sounds nothing like a DJ100 (my favorite headphone) 
 
I wonder if there is a step up in the Hifiman series that has more forward sounding female vocals. I mean I want them to be accurate, but a little forwardness doesn't hurt. The HD-580, 598, Q701 and DJ100 are all good for me in this area. I would say most of my collection is based on their mids.
 
I wonder if there's a Hifiman headphone that's similar to the HD-598 but with more forward upper mids and more treble. That's another weird thing.. 598 graphs don't even remotely show how it sounds to me. On paper it doesn't look like it would have forward mids at all. One review said it has forward upper mids, but that's not on it's graphs.
 
I don't necessarily need forward mids, but I listen to a lot of vocal oriented music. I do hate V-shaped signatures mostly. The last one I heard that was OK was the DT-770 Pro 80.
 
 
So...what is the closest match to the HE-400? Maybe a weird mix of the DT-880 and HD-650?  I always find it amusing to describe my headphones this way. I kind of think my K601 is a mix of the HD-600 and K702. Ok, i'm weird..sorry.

@Madmullusk
 
Pardon my ignorance but wouldn't the Q/K701 and the HE-400 be considered polar opposites of one another? The reason I ask is because over the last couple of days as I've slowly read through the beginning of the thread I've noticed the Q mentioned off an on and I'm rather surprised people would mention this headphone considering it's so different. I haven't heard the HE-400 but I have heard a K701 and I considered it more of an analytical then neutral. Of coarse YMMV so to speak so I'm not questioning your findings or anyone else. I'm just surprised you and others on here seem to like the HE-400 and Q701. Usually people who like a Q/K701 headphone tend to gravitate more towards headphones such as the Bayer T1 ,DT990 etc and keep away from warmer lusher sounding headphones like the HE-400.
Risking derailing the thread again I can't help but ask. In everyone's opinion compared to the O2/ODAC combo does the Headroom Micro DAC/amp combo really perform that much better for the money spent? Sorry for the derail but I'm looking into a desktop rig setup and I'm wanting a setup with very little coloration so as not to worry about what to hook up to it. From what I've read the ODAc/O2 combo sounds like a dream come true but the Micro combo also seems like a nice option. I'm just wondering if it's really worth the extra money.

HE500s are your friend if you want planar with a forward (or rather, neutral, not forward or laidback) sound.
 
A laid-back signature like HE400s has an interesting effect though, it actually makes vocals more "upclose"; you know how someone sounds different when they are speaking 5 ft away from you, vs speaking right beside you? The laid-back voicing actually creates the latter effect. It's weird. I'd even go so far as to say the colouration makes certain vocals eerily realistic at times, as if it "negates" the effect of recording a piece of vocal music, and ends up reproducing the vocals in a more real timbre. The only thing detracting from this is the overly emphasized upper treble that adds some tizziness to certain vocal music.
 
My attempts at EQing up the upper midrange only makes the timbre less "ultra-realistic", that's why I always end up abandoning parametric EQ with these cans.

No doubt about it; they are very different sounding headphones indeed. But I'm not exactly married to one sound-signature. I love most of my headphones for different reasons. Right now the Q's don't get much head-time, in part, because, as you put it, they are very analytical (I should never use the word "neutral" again--I don't have any clue what that word means anymore. We all use it so differently.) Also my hd800's are gathering dust right now for the same reason the Q's are gathering dust. The hd650 is still quite magical to me, but, you guessed it, even "old reliable" is not getting any real head-time right now. I guess (to finally answer your question), I just have a tendency to compare the he400 with the other headphones in my stable. I mentioned the Qs to Tdockweiler, however, because he is the guy who started the Q701 appreciation thread, and I was curious if he had made the jump to Hifiman headphones too.

I know you were not talking to me, but the Q701 is definitely considered warm to me. This is basically from my ODAC/Micro Amp and even the E9/ODAC. I haven't tried the O2. Of course lots of us in the Q701 get into heated arguments about how or if the two are any different. I would say there are now more people who find them warmer and bassier than the K702. I've owned the K702 and K701 more than any other headphone. Let's just say I have a love/hate thing with it! The Q701 has more than a touch of warmth. For me it's like a mix of an HD-580(slightly more aggressive sounding than the HD-600) and K702. At least that's how mine sounds.
 
I don't find the Q701 cold or analytical at all. It's quite balanced, but leaning toward being musical for me. Whatever the heck that means. I do hope the HE-400 will top the Q701 as a favorite! You never know. I'll admit I prefer a brighter headphone with a touch of warmth to it. HD-580 and Q701 are perfect. Don't like the HD-600 much (same driver I know!).
 
Unfortunately the Headroom Micro is not that popular here. It's kind of pricey compared to the Asgard, but IMO it was definitely an upgrade. I think I'm only a raving fanboy of two audio products. The Micro Amp and DJ100. Loving the ODAC though. I'm sure the O2 is equally as good as the Micro Amp, but i've never compared them. I still have no regrets paying the money for the Micro. Sometime i'll compare them, but i'm perfectly happy with it. The only negative is that people will think you're driving all your power hungry headphones with a weak portable amp  This thing is half the height of the E9, but does include a brick power supply.
 
Tyll on Inner Fidelity just measured the Portable Micro amp (it's slightly different I believe) and it seems pretty flat. Maybe he'll tell you how it compares to the O2. I'm definitely curious. I'd also love to compare it to the M-Stage which costs a bit less, but is imported. Since you asked, I don't find the Micro Amp adds any coloration to ANY of my headphones. If it does it's so extremely minor. When this happens, it's my DAC or CD player. The output impedance is also .5 ohm. Not sure what the O2 is.
 
I also don't find the amp to make the treble of any headphones easier on the ears etc. Certainly not the K702. It's actually hard to describe what the Micro Amp sounds like. I guess that's the biggest compliment I can give it! If it doesn't drive the He-400 well enough, then i'll be surprised. The hardest headphone I've found to drive so far has been the K400. I imagine the Micro might struggle with some of the other Hifiman headphones, but maybe not?
 
I'm guessing nobody has tried the Micro with the He-400 or other Hifiman headphones. Maybe I can find someone who has both the O2 and Micro. It seems that back 5 years ago Headroom stuff was much more popular on here.
 
Oh yeah, I doubt the Micro Amp is twice as good as the O2. It's twice as expensive I think. I doubt many amps under $300 can compete with the O2 or am I wrong (mainly when it comes to measurements and how transparent it is)? Probably nothing US built. Maybe the Asgard, but only with specific headphones. Nobody has measured the Asgard I imagine. Chances are I might like the O2+ODAC as much as the Micro+ODAC. Then again, maybe not.

I'll throw my 10 cents in -
 
My first impressions of the HE-400 are that they are quite "lean" sounding, but spacious and very accurate. I too expected a "recessed" mid-range, and was concerned that they might be too laid back to really like. Right off the bat I noticed a lot of texture, especially in bass lines. They were not "bright", either, but I certainly wouldn't call them warm. My HD595s were considered "bright" for Sennheiser, but what that amounted to was a slight bit more treble emphasis.
 
I listened to them for days and this impression started to fade - they became more "aggressive" sounding to me, with a "subwoofer playing that I can't turn up".
 
Then I got my little O2 amp to see what more power might do. I now think I was on crack.
 
If there is a "recessed midrange" I don't hear it - these babies translate lyrics for me I could never make out before. They are very vocal-forward, and by that, I mean the midrange seems like it has no issue keeping up with bass/treble lines. If the bass was contributing to my "lean" impression before, that is gone. Amped up a bit, the bass is strong, punchy, and very deep (track providing). Any "mid bass" it was lacking in comparison to my old phones has gone missing. Better yet, it is still wonderfully textured. The treble, which seems problematic for some, is still comfortable for me. 
 
In short, don't let the weird frequency response chart throw you - the sound these present SEEMS flat (even if it isn't). By that I mean bass, midrange, and treble seem to have a very deliberate and pleasing balance. If anything, the HE-400 tilts toward my idea of "bright" (where bright = justice for rock type music, enough edge to be fun, not enough to be annoying). The power of the sound and the ease with which it is presented has been a revelation for me, though I've got to stop cranking up for the sake of my ears.
 
That said, its the music you listen to that is the last ingredient. The only thing these phones seem to do is kick butt on whatever I give them - pop, classical, jazz. They love vocal and non-vocal music. Its a great balance, especially for me - I love the comfort of Sennheiser, but find them too damn polite at times.

So, HE400 vs HD650, FLAC through a Fuze LOD and an O2, trying to put as many objective relative comments and as few ambiguous words in there as this arena allows.
 
I found that what the 400 does, it does very well, and that's clarity, detail and separation.  When you have a lot of brass and deep strings going on in an orchestral piece, the HD650 tended to let them blur out the finer-bodied instruments like flutes, clarinets and smaller strings, very slightly.  Their timbre could still be heard, but had to be concentrated on somewhat.  The HE400 on the other hand, was super-clear, with the texture of the finer instruments immediately apparent.  Unfortunately the body of the deeper instruments just wasn't there; the bass was, and it was very clear, but there was something missing (the same something that resulted in the very slight blurring with the HD650).  
 
An example of this is the guitar in the background of this song at 1:20.  It's there on every decent 'phone I have, but it's so immediately apparent on the HE400s.  Whether or not this is a good thing will depend on whether your listening style requires it or whether having detail thrust at you will cause you to focus on it at the expense of everything else.
 
When it comes to air and clarity , I think they were improved by the fact that the HE400s are more open than the 650s; the HE400 drivers (not pads) seem to cause less isolation of outside noise, which I think decreases the distinction between sound that's coming from the drivers and ambient sound.  This was the case both with music playing, and with the headphones silent.
 
When it came to less populated tracks and tracks without many deep instruments, I felt that the 650 outshone the 400.  The 400's emphasis on treble gave the impression of detail and texture, but that detail/texture was still present through the 650s, just not thrown in your face.  The smooth texture of the mids (and I hesitate to use terms like bass, mids and treble anymore because I realise I don't know exactly what falls where) was so valuable in my enjoyment of these pieces and were exactly what I was hoping for in a headphone, coming from the UM3X.  The flute at :40 in the video below is a prime example of something that was euphoric through the HD650s and relatively empty through the HE400s.  The same was true for female vocal, with a great example being the harmonising at 2:28 in the video above (which gets butchered by youtube's compression anyway, but even so)
 

 
My bass/I-don't-give-a-crap-about-timbre tracks were from Avenged Sevenfold's "City of Evil" and The Prodigy's "Invaders Must Die".  While the 400 has better extension down low, I didn't miss it while listening to the 650s, and I did miss a bit of impact that I felt was lost in the mid-bass when listening to the HE400s.  Additionally, these songs are filled with crashing symbals and other reasonably harsh sounds.  I can barely listen to them at moderate to high listening volumes with the 400s, let alone enjoy them.  I found the 650s to smooth out the harshness without dulling them.
 
Tracks incorporating a bit of both (textured acoustic instruments and  synths/heavy bass)from artists like Shpongle and Infected Mushroom were more enjoyable on the HD650.  The airiness, clarity and minute details aren't worth much, because of the recording and style of music.
 
A few random things
 
Build quality.  The HiFiMans look and feel like a top-of-the-line 'phone that's lacking a bit of polish and budget.  Funny, because that's pretty much what they are.  The HD650s are light and plasticky and feel like a peripheral, rather than a piece of equipment in their own right.  They don't look very durable (when it comes to abuse, not longevity) and the fit/finish is slightly below what I'd have expected from a ~$400 phone, given what I've seen of HiFiMan and Shure's offerings at this price point.
Price.  I don't know what the going rate is for HD650s in the rest of the world, but in Australia I'm looking at $350 online and $480 local, which is the maximum I could justify on a headphone.  Coming from my UM3Xs, it's not a matter of which costs less, but whether the HE400 has anything to offer over what I currently own.  While it has fantastic qualities for 20% of my music library, the sound sig is unusable for most of it, so it doesn't.  The HD650 does, and doesn't give a huge lot up when looking at the HE400s qualities in isolation, either.
Weight.  As I said a bit earlier, the HE400 gives the impression of quality in the same way a 1911 does compared to a Glock (for the shooters amongst use).  That is to say, it is not just solid and inflexible, but also heavy, which may or may not be a bad thing for you.
 
Hopefully that helps anyone who's considering the 400s and knows what sound they like.

Prospective buyers who are on a budget, attend! The he400 pairs amazingly well with the Fiio e9, the little amp that could! For 90 bucks it's a steal folks. I bamboozled my wife into helping me with a blind-audio test over here. I won't bore anyone with the particulars of that set-up or the exact results, but it boils down to this: I couldn't tell the difference between this little guy and my vintage receiver.  So if you've been putting off a purchase because you can't afford a nice amp and these headphones both, well uncle Mollusk here wants to reassure you: the Fiio e9 is the answer! No more excuses folks. I wont have it. Buy these dang headphones!  You no longer have to borrow or beg for money to realize your audio dreams; you don't have to "work the streets" and demean yourselves for the extra cash either. The Fiio e9 is here! Can i get a "Hallelujah!"

Yeah, I had to grab the OST for Arietty; it's just my kind of music.  If you enjoy it, I suggest checking out Akiko Shikata and Yuki Kajiura.  A bit of a different flavour, but still full of beautiful instruments and female vocals.  Some incredible composition, too.
 
As for the build quality of the Senns... I might not enjoy them every time I see or hold them, but once they're on my head, I forget that completely.  I'd still have thought that for the price (especially what you're paying retail in the US) they'd have better tolerances/assembly.  As it stands, the "bottleneck" isn't so much the materials as the fact that some of the seams aren't smoothed or are very slightly misaligned.
 
Just look at a pair of ATH-M50s and it's obvious that you can have excellent build quality in plastic for a quarter of the price.
 
*EDIT*  Actually, I wonder if you could put the 650 cup/driver assemblies on a donor headband/brackets?  Obviously not the M50s (which is a shame) because they're oval, but has anyone ever tried it?  Shouldn't be too hard to do a decent smoothing job with some bog and sandpaper and then airbrush a nice matte black over the top of the 650 cups...  Has anyone ever tried anything like that around here?

I thought that I'd post my review of the Maddogs by Mr. Speakers, as they are somewhat similar headphones to the he400 and I make several comparisons between the two hp's in the review. 
 
 
Maddog vs He400
 
I have owned several modded versions of the t50rp including the lastest bmf variant, Rastapants 2 and my own feeble attempt. The truth of the matter with the t50rp is that there is magic in this hp when put into the hands of the right modder. Of this, there is no question. I didn’t set out to purchase the MD to do a comparison with the he400, but after listening to them for about an hour I knew that it must be done.
 
Maddog initial impressions:
 
The product comes very well packaged in a double box. USPS box inside of smaller box containing the hp. It’s a nice touch and good to know that these hp’s will arrive safely without question. The version that I ordered included the “dog pads” and “comfort strap”. The website says there are also dual cables included. The original stock mogami with 1/4 “ adapter and a V-Moda cable with 1/8” adapter. Mine did not come with the v-moda cable but Dan replied quickly when I pm’ed him and said that he’d ship one right out. The dual cable would be advantageous for me as I’d like to be able to use these from my portable setup from time to time.
 
After making a quick adjustment to the headband for fit, I settled these MD’s on to give them a good listen. The first thing you notice with the MD is the comfort. I was blown away at just how comfortable these hp’s are. I had made a headband mod on my old pair that took the pressure point off the top of the head and moved it to the left and right side, ala hd650 pad. Well, the MD is infinitely more comfortable than that. The leather strap allows the stap to stay just barely “suspended” below the headband and is honestly as comfortable on the top of the head as any hp that I’ve tried. The next thing you notice is the new dog pads. They are very very close to my old d5k pads in terms of feel and comfort…plush and supple and very nice on the ears. The overall comfort of the MD after an hour is simply outstanding. An hour of listening is usually a good indicator for how comfortable any headphone will be in the long run for me. The MD does not disappoint here.
 
So how do they sound? Let’s get right to it then. I have heard lots of variations of this t50rp so I was very interested in seeing what Dan had been able to do.  Let me address the bass first. It’s deep and textured and very well-tuned to the rest of the spectrum. Actually it’s quite comparable to the he400 bass. I may call myself having wanted a touch more bass when I first put these on, but after listening for an hour I’d say that the mid bass hump is nearly non-existent and the sub bass in an impressive feature of these hp’s. Head to head against the he400, it’s a very close contest. If I were really pushed to choose one or the other or declare a winner, I’d pick the he400’s bass by nat’s eyelash. It might be the larger driver or the heavier magnet…not sure. But there just seem to be a touch more refinement and texture to the he400 sub bass. But it’s about as close as it can get.
 
The sound stage on the MD is quite decent for a closed hp. No, it’s not nearly as good as the he400 which sounds nearly holographic in its presentation. But this is a closed hp and the tradeoff for decreased sound stage is very nice isolation. The MD does this well.  If isolation is your thing, then look no further.
 
The mids are silky smooth and effortless.  The planar sound is very apparent here. Vocals and particularly female voices are reproduced with aplomb. They are natural and very enjoyable.
I found the treble as well as the mids a touch on the dark side. This is in agreement with other modded t50rp variations that I’ve heard. Please don’t misunderstand. It’s a very elegant “dark with detail” presentation akin to what you’d hear with an lcd2r2 product. The treble extends well and is accurate. This is not what you’d classify as a bright headphone. When I look at what Dan has done with the MD, it’s an impressive feat indeed. The bottom line is that this is an incredibly enjoyable hp to listen to. It’s a good all-rounder and doesn’t have a real weak spot.
 
Nitpicking
 
I had one variation of the t50rp with Stax o2 pads and they were luxurious in every sense of the word. Better than the dog pads? Probably, yes. But hey, they were also more expensive at $115.  I wonder if they would further improve on the MD. The leather on the Stax is thicker and feels more durable. The Stax also seems to have a touch more padding and extends the cup further from the ear.  The lambskin leather on the MD is soft and supple but very different than the Stax, kind of an opposite approach. Overall I’d say that I’d prefer then Stax pads given the price of the dog pad is $70 to existing customers only. For only $45 you could have the Stax but I don’t know how it would affect the sound of the hp for better or for worse.
 
Conclusion, Wrap Up and Final Comparisons
 
Amping is always a consideration when it comes to orthos. So with the MD, I find a wonderful pairing with the lyr. The MD with their magic dampening and acoustics materials take quite a bit of juice to bring out the dynamics. They remind me somewhat of the hd650 with regard to amping. On my fiio e17, they just don’t shine. On the e09 they are quite decent. But on the lyr, they are truly impressive.
This is how I see it. There is no denying that the MD is an incredible product. Then consider the level of sound quality that they are able to achieve at a price point $100 less than the he400. Then also consider that the MD is one of the most comfortable hp’s on the planet. Honestly, its compelling from all angles.

So now the HE-400 is a mix of the 990 and HD-650? If so, then maybe I think i'd like it. I loved the mids of the HD-650, but mostly for vocals. Then maybe i'll get lucky and find the 650 really does have more extended bass than the 600. Never really compared them much in this area. That would be a bonus.
 
It's weird how I never thought my HD-650s were somewhat dark until I used them for gaming  With music it's fine for me.
 
I like a combination of a warm + bright headphone. It seems this isn't all that common. 598, K601, 580 and Q701 are close enough for me. Some would say those are all just bright. Don't agree.
 
I think an HD-650 with very slightly less mid-bass and more treble would be perfect for me. The HD-600 is NOT it (for me).
 
It's weird that in some posts people say the 650 has more forward upper mids than the 600 and a peak in the treble. Wow, don't think I heard that! It makes no sense why, but female vocals on the 650 did seem more present than on the 600.

Sorry, I know this isn't the general consensus at all. It's just that in the past week I must have spent a few hours reading every very old HD-650 vs HD-600 thread I could find (some from 2003!). It's interesting how some have heard it a lot different than how most people usually describe it. Sometimes the differences in how things sound to them could be due to the HD-650 seeming like it has a smaller soundstage than the HD-600. It is interesting how the HD-650 did sound like most female vocals were more forward. This was all with the Asgard. The soundstage of the 650 did seem a bit more closed in.
 
I know it probably isn't true the HD-650 has a smaller soundstage and it's fairly easy for the brain to be tricked due to it having less treble and more bass. When I mod the HD-600 I get the same thing to happen. Of course I know it's all about the recording too..
 
 
BTW the HD-600 for me is 100% non-fatiguing, but yet there was some part of the HD-650 signature that kind of bothered me like 5% of the time. I think maybe i'm somewhat sensitive to lower mids more than most. No, the HD-650 is NOT fatiguing. I just don't think it's as "laid back" as people say.
 
Don't ask me why, but the HD-600 makes me sleepy, but I preferred listening to the HD-650 for most of my music. Some genres obviously did better on the HD-600. I prefer anything with a huge soundstage on the HD-600. I think I got rid of the HD-650 due to it's mid-bass. Maybe I didn't try enough amps and sources. It makes no sense but I hated acoustic music on the HD-650.
 
There's actually one guy who said the HD-650 had harsh treble  Another saying it has a peak in the treble(!). Funny people, but that's ok! Nobody ever agrees on how a headphone sounds.
 
The HD-650 did seem kind of bassy, very warm and somewhat dark. Still liked it. At the time I was kind of obsessed about sound clarity and detail  Now i'm caring a bit less about that. the 650 always did sound a tad muffled at times. Probably nit-picking.
 
It seems that graphs for the Sennheisers don't always show how they really sound. The HD-598 sounds like it has fairly forward (sounding) mids, but on paper it seems more balanced than the HD-600. Again, the more forward sounding mids could be due to something else causing it to sound this way. I remember once I swore that the HD-598 had more treble than the HD-580/600. Now i'm not sure this is really true!
 
So..still split on the HE-400 or giving the HD-650 another try. I think the very neutral ODAC would be enough to make me love the HD-650. It'll be a good alternative to the Q701.

My opinion about the HD650, the Mad Dogs, the HE-400, and the HE-500.
 
The HD650 never seemed to wow me, the mids were fantastic though, and yes they are great for acoustical music.
I just think it's a crime that a headphone is only suited for a certain genre. That just means it's flaws are less apparent in other genres.
Yes I think the sound signature of the HD650 is flawed, I had to boost the highs and lows quite a bit, to get some sparkle and punch.
 
The Mad Dogs, I liked these better than the HD650s but still no wow factor for me. It's really pleasing and warm, but there's no in your face detail and the soundstage is quite wide but I missed the sense of realness. I don't think it's quite fair to compare the MDs to the unmodded HE-400 since the MDs are optimized in every single way. Atleast do the grill mod, since it's pretty cheap, and perhaps change the earpads and put a filter on for the highs.
 
Yes, pricewise the HE-400 is less attractive than the MDs, but with some cheap and easy modding I think you can get more out of the HE-400s. The drivers are simply better.
 
The HE-400, it has the best detail and seperation I have ever heard, and it did sound quite neutral apart from the boost in the highs (adding a thin piece of paper as a filter would help tremendously).
When I buy a high end headphone, I am expection insanly good detail and seperation and soundstage, and I wasn't hearing this at all on the HD650 or the Mad Dogs for that matter.
 
HE-400 vs HE-500: I did not hear that much of a difference actually. The HE-500 was smoother, more neutral but hey I think the same could be achieved with some eq-ing or filtering on the HE-400.
I did only compared them for i'd say 15 minutes, but first impressions are important. I think the HE-400 is the winner in the performance-price ratio here. If you have more than enough money then just get the HE-500 and you don't have to worry about a thing!

Funny to see how impressions differed so much from back then. I remember very sporadic and completely off-base comments on the "big three" when I first started lurking in '07. Once you go back to the beginning of the appreciation threads...well, it's fun to read, I won't say more.
 
I think the smaller soundstage was from the darker tone, making them sounding more claustrophobic (not that they were, just relative to the HD600). I sometimes wonder where exactly in the frequency range female vocals would tend to be, as it can differ so much I can never pinpoint it. 
 
The HD580 is very sleepy, but also very unfatiguing and inoffensive, a great hallmark of a good headphone. I though the HD600 with it's slightly brighter tone would be better, but the difference isn't dramatic at all. 
 
I think it's because of the lighter bass and treble that the HD598s sounded mid forward. Or more precisely, mid-centric. While the others are mid-centric, it's really not to the extent of the HD598. 
 
I think one of the great things about the HE-400 is that while it can be darker than the HE-400 in some areas, they just pull of this sheer clarity that can easily beat out the Senns. The bass is very linear and really a whole different experience from the Senns. You really have to try them to understand. It's hard to put into words, but the best I can do would be to put them as "realistic". I think they'd be an interesting and worthwhile compliment to your other cans.

That's what I expected with my pair, but I was surprised that when I tried mine it was not like this. It could be due to very broken in pads (flatter) or possibly thousands of hours of use. This one is the silver screen version. I got it used for $150 about 8 months ago and have loved it ever since. It's probably #2 behind my Q701 when it comes to favorites.
 
To my ears this one is like a slightly more aggressive sounding HD-600. Very, very similar though. This has more forward upper mids, less bass, more treble and a clearer sound than the HD-600. I actually get a very similar sound on the HD-600 by blocking off air with a piece of foam on the back of the driver.
 
It's pretty amazing to me how the HD-580 is so much more fun to me than the HD-600!
 
The HD-598 doesn't sound like it's mids are too forward to me. I've found that on the E10 and the wrong amp it can be very "shouty". Mine is recabled with Mogami though, but shouldn't make a huge difference. I hated it with the E10 and dislike it on the E11. It's nice how it doesn't always require an amp and sounds good even from my Clip+
 
My HD-580 sounds like a 598 on steroids. More treble, more upper mids and a tiny bit of extra bass. Much smaller soundstage though. I now actually think the 580 has more detail too.
 
The 580 I have is definitely brighter than my HD-600. Could be some 580s are much darker and bassier. I did have the old version once, but I was clueless back then and did not have an external amp for it! Ugh. What's funny is that I had the Bose AE1 and unamped HD-580 and preferred the AE1

By realistic mids, I mean that the HE-400's sound sig keeps the mids in line with the bass, not making it sound sweetened or pushed back. They sound like what I'd consider voices to really sound like, IMHO. Only the treble seems to be a bit stronger than what it needs to be. The bass is definitely stronger than I'd say is neutral, though it comes off naturally, and not overemphasized. Trust me, I love overemphasized bass, but the HE-400 is at a fine line between natural and 'fun enhanced'.
The HD650 to me is a bit darker than neutral, and the treble is glazed over, but a mid treble EQ would probably make them sound incredibly neutral. The mids as it stands are hauntingly close. Lots of my music put the vocals closer than I believe they were intended, for sure, though that's what makes the HD650 special to me. The HD598 does that too, but in an unnatural amount of forwardness to the mids, IMHO. Almost invasive mids. Probably due to the weaker bass, that further exaggerated the mids to me.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/11/12 at 12:42pm

I've spent a big part of my day trying to prepare for the arrival of my HE-400s tomorrow, and now i think i'm finally ready :) I've successfully burned some lossless .WAV files to a DVD which is a lot more complicated than it sounds. DVD players don't support wav or flac files by default, so i had to convert the files into .VOB video files with a black image as the video and my lossless collection as the audio. It took the better part of the day trying to wade through all the crapware of conversion tools but i ended up finding one that automates the process beautifully. 
 
I mentioned a while back that i don't have a dac yet, so the dvd player is the next best option for me since it's the only source i have that i can hook up my M-stage to. Im really excited because the jump in quality from my laptop to the M-stage is quite staggering using the Sennheiser HD 280 pro, i can't imagine what the HE-400 would sound like 
 
I picked out a lot of songs that i know would test the HE-400, as well as many which should sound awesome :) Look forward to some pictures with my setup as well as impressions

I know AKG uses memory foam in a few models (including the new K702 Anniversary Edition.)  Trouble with memory foam is the warmer it gets, the softer it gets.  So the longer you wear them the more they change.  It's both good and bad.  Good because it forms to your face more.  Bad because it changes the position of the driver over time, so you'd want it to be extra thick so the ear doesn't touch the driver housing more than is needed.  Also it tends to store heat...even the open cell stuff.
 
Try to find some of the OLD HFM pads for comparison.  Both the material of the velour, and the foam stuffing inside were substantially superior quality to the new ones.   The new ones are made out of dollar store grade materials more or less, especially in contrast to the old ones.  The trouble with the old ones was the horrible attachment system and the exposed hard glue on the inside of the cup.  They were made horribly out of good materials.  The new ones are made well out of horrible materials.
 

 
I didn't notice the original post that started this discussion.  Are you going into the headphone accessories business?

It's certainly true that the cost of large manufacture is low, but there's the combined budgets of importing, tariffs, taxes, paying for the office to do it all in, paying for the electricity there, paying staff, paying payroll taxes, paying taxes for tax paying privileges, paying taxes for employees taxes for paying tax paying privileges, plus R&D, marketing, legal defenses from the dozen or so places that will sue you to claim your product is really their product, and the 10 levels of extra labeling and tagging of the extremely deadly consequences of using the product, only in the People's Republic of California .  By the time it's all said and done, the huge "profit margins" over the cost of manufacture are often very very thin on products, despite how it would look otherwise.  It's just that the money over the cost of manufacture is hidden into all kinds of other things.  Add onto that with companies like Sennheiser the kickbacks for dealers built into the price as a form of incentive/marketing, and a $10 product can easily sell for $100 and turn only moderate profit, but it looks like gauging if you look at just the cost of manufacture.
 
Somehow those that never cease cheering for "taxing evil companies" more never seem to understand that there's no such thing as taxing a company, it just makes the cost of products go up

Apropos of nothing: 
 
 
You know, I respect Tyll from Innerfedilty  immensely, but I just don't understand why he hasn't reviewed the he400 yet. I know he's one guy and can't possibly review every new headphone that happens to roll down the pike, but C'mon, dude! I mean these are serious headphones that are selling for a pittance. I had an opportunity  to spend some time with the he-500 recently and I think Matt was spot-on with his earlier comments. The he-500 may objectively measure better than the he-400, but the differences with square-waves and all that junk has to be academic, at least in comparing these headphones! Does the he-500 sound a little different/better? You bet, but not by a great deal, unless you're the type to fetishise small difference--and yes, I know that many headphone enthusiasts do exactly that, so no offense to anyone! But my main point here is this: the practical, real-world, ears-only difference between the he400 and he500 is sound-signature. End of story. And since I know Tyll loves the he-500, I'm just wandering if he ever plans to give the he-400 serious consideration. One more thing: he put the AKG K550 on his wall of fame! Holy Felony, Batman! I mean those headphones are fine for sealed headphones, but the 550's treble is lit-up like some demented Christmas tree. Moreover, the he-400 just murders those headphones in just about every way--and hey, they only cost 100 bucks more! (Apples and Oranges here maybe, so I won't push the comparisons.) Sigh. Oh well. I don't mean to rant, but I think quality headphones like he-400 just shouldn't be ignored  by the elites among us--so consider this a plea to the powers that be.

I hear u..and i agree with u until a certain point..having owned the he300, the he400 and now the he500.. I must say the he500 is the more complete headphone of the three..yeah ur right..its probably not a better sound quality difference of 300 euros compared to the he400..but..listening on my amp and my cables i do prefer the sound signature of the he500..but as u say..its personal..and no ..am not a headphone fetishist..i use my headphones to listen to music when i come home from work all tired..i found out it relaxes me..and with the he400 i couldnt listen to it relaxed..was strange actually..because with the he300 i didnt have that experience..with the he500 and the he300 i sometimes even fell alseep because of the sweet sounds..on the he400 it was more active..more in ur face..cant really put it into words really..don get me wrong..for the price the he400 is a bargain..as is his little brother and his bigger sister but for listening experience..its the he500 thats wins..always..even how small the better quality of sound it may have over the he400.Edited by hifimanrookie - 11/13/12 at 9:07am

Who approaches Tyll with reverence? A simple "review this!" while throwing an HE-400 at him will do just fine 
 
 

 
Could, should, would, is irrelevant.  The simple matter in terms of product costs is there's no such thing as corporate taxes.  Taxing HFM $5 more for each HE-400 sold means the cost of HE-400 goes up by $5.  It just gets put into the cost of the product, and the consumer pays for it.  It's just a convenient way of referring to it so politicos can save face and pretend "someone else" is paying for it because they get to make the retailer into the tax collector and look like the bad guy.   When talking about the cost of a small pad maker...that's certainly a factor in it, and the smaller the shop, the more of that needs to be rolled into the product cost because it can't be shifted around and deducted elsewhere.  $80+ for pads seems crazy, and at Sennheiser's volume perhaps it is, but smaller shops like Audeze and the independents, costs like that add up really fast.

I also used my he300 sometimes all night listening..so at least 6 hours until batt goes dead on hm602..until now i couldnt listen to my he500 for more then 1 hour..before getting some kind of pressure on my head and a little headache..even at normal listenng levels..much lower then i used to on my he300..but now i know why..since this morning 10:00 am i got my new Aura power cables delivered..and man what an impact it made on my rig..the sound got more velvetly..especially the highs got more attached onto the mids...and the lows were more of a rumble more balanced now instead of cold hard mid bass...and i have been listening to my rig now for at least 7 hours now..with no headaches or pressure..so i think the headaches can be caused by elevated sensitivy for unbalanced tremble...maybe its the case with u also..try a warmer phone/amp and see how it goes..with me i am in heaven now

Thanks for all the advice everyone. I am going to give the ears a nice break, and continue with alcohol/vinegar drops as the last dose seems to have relieved some pressure.
 
I once had a wax blockage for year! Drs. typically laughed at it while I was convinced I might actually be going deaf. Meanwhile I adjusted to it for the most part, and figured car-audio was to blame. Then one day I visited the doc and forced him to do something. Sure enough, we found some scarring on the drum and impacted ear wax.
 
But when the wax was forced out holy S*** I thought I had super-hearing. It was like the world was 20 dB'ed cranked up just for me. That went on for days. Therefore to this day I am quite consientious and paranoid about impacted wax but actually avoid cu-tips but try gentle rinsing as needed.
 
I will likely be fine, but once in awhile I do seem to need to take measures to get beat the "wax creep" sensation into submission. I took anti-biotics for a similar issue a couple years ago. Since then, alcohol and vinegar is an awesome infection killer (if you think you might have one coming).

Most Ear-Drops use alcohol in them I noticed. I usually seek out 70-90% common isopropyl alcohol and ordinary white vinegar (also a great household cleaner 50% diluted with water). Whiskey is probably good, but would be weaker. More like Moonshine!
 
Hydrogen Peroxide FEELS like it is cleaning you well, but I feel I've had better success with my mixture, which was also med-professional approved. If you think you get swimmers ear a lot, a couple drops before and after a swim / shower shouldn't hurt anything. You will smell like vinegar a little, which lingers, but the alcohol dissolves. That stuff will definitely kill infection and dissolve ear wax a little. But it is important to drop, gently massage, and LEAVE ALONE. Cu Tips are a no no. Let it drain naturally and you will have less issues.
 
And of course remember that wax serves a purpose, so don't go nuts using the stuff!

Headphone use should not end up causing physical issues with the ears beyond ear sensitivity/pain/ringing from excessive volume.  If you're getting pain, fluids, etc, that is being caused by something unrelated to over the ear headphones. 
 
Maybe it's from IEMs maybe it's from your past was build up issues....but pain and fluid sound like a more serious problem than headphones....infection, or maybe just impacted wax, etc.  But if the peroxide is burning....I would seriously get that looked at if you value this hobby.  Peroxide in the ear should feel funny....not burn...
 

 
+1 I agree.   Though you've made me a afraid to ever use my SE535s again   Which tips were you suing with your Westones?
 

 
Depends on the cable.  Moon Audio cables and the stock HE-400 Canare tend to wiggle themselves off quite frequently for me and many others.  The HE-6 cable and Q cables virtually never have a problem with their high flexibility.  Any cable that acts as its own strain relief is usually fine.  Any cable that applies pressure to the connector if it's moved, including the stock one, is probably not fine.
 
It's annoying, but the most annoying thing seems to be for cable makers...they hate those SMC connectors.  People that change their cables often tend to also have issues with it.  SMC (mini-F) was meant for connections that rarely get touched such as satellite dish installs and things...they were never meant for high-flex. However I don't have any intention of getting replacement connectors installed in my cans, either.
 


I don't think there are any connectors that solve that particular problem.
 
  
=============================================
Topic: 8866933 in thread 604583
=============================================


 
I hand tighten as much as possible.  Again, the Moon and stock cables tend to have that issue, but the Q and HE-6 stock cable rarely do with their flexibility.  Sometimes they do though.  I also wrap the cable paralell to the headband when I put it on my stand, and I think the "up-sweep" of the cable has a habit of loosening them.
 

 
Do I hear the need for a shorter aftermarket cable? 
 

 
Ouch!  I'm not sure I'd want to tool-tighten those connectors....they're just soldered in there, and to much force could easily break them free! It's a good idea overall and no doubt works.  For the connector it's fine, but the connector attachment inside the headphone, I'd be a little afraid of that.
 

 
That's awful.  I love the Shure Olives with my 535's (I think they fit Westone too) so they're probably a bit more sanitary than the white foam.  But still that's pretty scary stuff.  I do have a bit more reservation about using IEMs for that reason, it's always struck me as a possible risk in that sense, though I don't often hear about people with issues from it.  I find it interesting that 6 hours was a problem since people that need in-ear protective plugs for work/safety purposes probably wear them longer than that!
 
I certainly wouldn't take the risk either! Yikes!
 

 
Does the DH really need tool tightening?  Is it the Molecule?  Seems pretty flexible to me!

Yeah I saw the Grados one, I was thinking about getting that eventually. I would rather not add a whole nother 8 inches to my cable length since I would only be using it for portable use, but that does make sense that a straight adapter would damage the plug. That's actually why they're all reviewed so low.
 
And as far as cables/adapters go, walmart has some decent stuff sometimes. That's where I got my RCA cables at and they're great. At any rate, it doesn't appear that they have anything of the sort for this kind of adapter.
 
I think I do have a RCA male to 6.3mm female which I could hook up a 3.5 to 6.3 adapter to, and then for the RCA side I have an RCA female to 3.5mm female which I could then use a 3.5 male to 3.5 male that I have to hook up to my Cowon... but I think that adds about 15 feet to my cable...

No reason for me to mod them. I like them as is. I'm not a modder. I tried the quarter pad mod, and Sennheiser pad mod on the KSC75 and it made them horrible to me. That was the last thing I bothered doing. The only thing I wanna do to the KSC35 is get a pair of KSC75s, and use the clips for it, which are 1000% more comfy. I had both on hand last time, but I bent the KSC75 clips and couldn't get them back to their original shape. The only problem I see, its that the 75's clips puts the drivers a little further, making it lose some SQ.... though that WAS with the bent clips, so maybe it will be better with a fresh pair.
As for the HE-4's half planar design, it honestly doesn't matter. It sounds organic, and very much like the HE400, just better balanced. I think they should try the half planar design again, if only for the massive increase in comfort due to less weight. I LIKE that they are unique that way.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/15/12 at 3:00pm

A wise enough position!  I'd say, I'm not sure if you used the pleather or velour pads, but since the overwhelming majority of fans that like the headphone insist on the velour, if you try them agan and try to acclimate yourself to the, be certain to use the velour pads.  IMO I really don't know why HFM insists on selling those pleather pads.  They do nothing but harm the sound on all of the HE-series.  They really need to just discontinue them or fully redesign them.  With the velours, to me personally, even though they're voiced differently, I've found HE-400 to have much in common with HE-6.  HE-6 does everything better, but for $400 or less it has a sufficient portion of the HE-6 magic to make it outstanding for the money.  Then again...last I checked you weren't a huge HE-6 fan, so preference may be at work across the HE-series for you

I agree.  It doesn't even have to be a "speaker amp" but should be one of the half dozen or so headphone amps that actually deliver almost enough power.  EF6, Dark Star, maybe Mjolnir (I have to do my own analysis of that one), etc.  Otherwise for price-performance the Emotiva Mini-X has gained a lot of popularity, though I've seen at least one person who strongly prefers Mjolnir to the Emotiva, and others that find that Mjolnir still pales next to some other speaker amps.
 
MJ and a few others deliver 5W into it which is "sort of almost kind of enough".  But the ability to deliver continuous current with reserves for the peak swings seems to be the sticking point.  Most of the HE-6 followers are in agreement that it's all about the power supply in terms of power (in terms of performance it's no different than any other headphone/speaker.)  And most headamps just don't have a power supply meant for that kind of continuous current draw, because for no other headphone do they need it.

True enough... 
 

 
True enough, and many of us often enough disagree with any "official" reviews that any review is kind of meaningless.  On the other hand, I'm not sure how an objective review site can be a really objective review site if it only reviews products it already knows it likes beforehand.  Isn't the idea to draw the differences between technically good and bad and who would like it even if it's not to the reviewer's preference? 
 
Double edged sword.  Reviewing products you don't like is unfair to the product because preference makes you dislike aspects of it someone else might like.  Meanwhile reviewing only products you like doesn't provide a balanced point of reference across all products or at least popular ones...it makes it more like a blog of things that the guy that runs it likes.  Ideally to make IF "more complete" one of the "staff" should be trying to review most of the things that need to be reviewed....  Ideally an experienced critic should be able to view the product not from the perspective of if they themselves like it but the ability to identify who would like it and what would be liked and disliked about it.  Conversely if not possible, then an alternate reviewer like Skylab should be able to pick up the opposite tastes of Tyll etc to at least get perspectives on the likes and dislikes of someone who likes profile A versus the reviewer that likes profile B.
 
It's not a knock on Tyll's decision and reasoning behind not reviewing HE-400.  Just some musing on what would make IF a better resource in these types of situations.

Indeed, and I think what sounds good largely depends on how individuals process sound.  I mentioned this earlier, but maybe it has enough relevance for me to mention again: everyone literally has unique hearing capacities. And even if we all had "perfect" hearing, hypothetically speaking, no two people would still hear things identically: biological diversity alone guarantees this. But I suppose there must be a "normal" or an "average" when it comes to hearing, and so I would  think that objective data would have some relevance, at least to the extent that you, or folks like you, require some basis--i.e. some fixed and measurable standards--to reliable characterize a given headphones sound and how that sound will most likely relate to the average persons perception of it. But I understand what you're saying: the subjective and objective blend together at some point; there are just too many variables--biologic and psychoacoustic variables--to ever say Headphone X will always sound "veiled" or "bright" etc to every listener. And when all is said and done, I think this might be the best argument for subjectivity and headphone appreciation.

On a more serious note though, glad that is working for you. I tried something like that and the "airiness reduction" effect is even more prominent than with the fabric from the stock grills. It's hard to describe it, as it's not even airiness, more like the background nuances...the only adequate description is from 6moons writeup:
 
"While cosmetics do take a hit—you'll see exactly what the final photo shows which is now barely obscured by the open honeycomb pattern—those fine decay trails and reverberations that were previously obscured (killed by damping as it were) are now released. This has nothing whatsoever to do with becoming sizzly or sharp. It's all about the restored breath of life. Things which previously felt somewhat flat, reined in and muted open up. Recorded ambience deepens and with it, spaciousness."
 
It's a subtle but dramatic improvement that you can't really pick up with analytical listening.

Cool that is reassuring haha, I know many state you cant really trust FR Graphs for the HE-400 and I am all for what sounds good over what looks good on paper, I know this has been touched upon a little in this thread (quite humorously I might add) after skimming through it a little bit, but I am sure we all like to have a look at a graph before we throw down 400$ on a pair of phones.
I have a pair of DT 880's that I am liking but I find on some recordings that are not the best they can be harsh on your ears and slightly hissy, I am really interested in trying a pair of planar magnetics but the FR Graphs have me hesitant about the HE-400 when comparing it to the HE-500, I understand there is a $300 gap but there is just so much upper mid drop off on the 400's!
Can anyone come with at least a slightly comparable headphone in terms of sound signature? 
Ill be using them through a O2+ODAC

I really can't, since all my previous phones were Sennheisers. They remind me a little of my IEM Sony EX85s, in terms of being more "aggressive", though I have come to accept Fang's description of the phones as like "American JBL" as opposed to say, European speakers. My JBLs are very airy, balanced, and handle rock and classical with quite a bit of grace. Then again my JBLS don't have the sort of bass reach that these phones do.
 
I too looked at the frequency and said, tons of bass, no mid-range, and hot treble. Uh-oh. Then I thought, nah, its pretty "V-Shaped", should be fun!
 
It may sound crazy but, these things come across as pretty darn "flat" - there are no obvious peaks, and they are extremely smooth. At the same time, they are not laid-back, so I find them very enjoyable across all my music formats. Just a really airy, transparent, and smooth presentation with awesome texture and bass extension. The sound awesome with rock/pop/electronic/classical. They'll work great with your amp/DAC also.
 
I guess I sound like a huge fan. More like a "planar" convert - I just don't think this sort of sound is easily accomplished by dynamic drivers - even really good ones like your beyers.

Okay fellow HE-400 owners. I've always been stubborn about EQ, but the longer I'm in this hobby the more I realize I need to not be.
This is my second go-around with the HE-400. It is simply awesome on every front, for me, except for its sound signature... I returned it last time for the same reason (although in part because I had a rev3 at the time). Namely, I love forward mids and these do not have that. Also, I would like the treble peak at 10k to be tamed quite a bit.
Seeing as I listen to headphones solely at my computer, I am now interested in a quality, easy-to-use EQ program. Using iTunes really basic, poorly tweakable EQ, I bumped up the 2K and 4K frequencies a bit and dropped the 8K and 16K a bit, and it is much more to the sound I crave! Using this basic EQ, I am getting nearly exactly what I'm looking for in a headphone. So I'm ready for a quality EQ program. Help me out here!
Seriously, I've been stubborn about EQ for no good reason, for too long. I love everything about the HE-400 except for the presentation of the mids and that high treble peak, and this tiny experiment with iTunes EQ opened my eyes, or ears rather. I want to tinker with an EQ program, and if that gets me even closer to the sound I'm craving, then I think I will be sold on the HE-400.

Just a few words about the build, and some early impressions.
 
These are built like a tank! It feels really sturdy and well made. I don't know, some impressions here made me feel it was a little on the cheap side but that's not the vibe im getting at all. As for the weight, it's a total non-issue for me. Again i was expecting them to feel like a brick on my head after reading posts here. I guess i have a strong neck, or everyone else has chicken necks! (kidding ) The stock pads are nice and soft, but i immediately put on the velours and they are certainly more comfortable. It was a little tricky at first getting them on but i got the hang of it.
 
The cable is also really long, i may need to get a custom one because all this length is going to waste on my desk.
 
Right now i have them plugged into my M-Stage. Gain at +10, volume meter at about 1'o clock, it's certainly plenty loud. I feel they may need some burn in. So far they haven't floored me like i expected, but then again i had my expectations really really high. I think i will grow to appreciate the sound with more head time, but for now they sound pretty good. I will certainly add to this with more listening.
 
One thing i should mention, i haven't yet detected any spikes in the treble. It all feels smooth, but then again i've only played a couple of songs. I have the rev2/3.5 as well, transparent/white housing inside.
 
More to come :)

To me, it's like I'm not wearing headphones (at least compared to other headphones). The sound is very enveloping, and projects around you more than something more typical out of other cans. There is a sense of space around instruments, and presented in more layers and from different locations around you. It ain't exactly virtual surround, but it's still very atypical of headphones.
It's not something as simple as having a large soundstage or imaging. Not easily defined. I've had headphones with huge soundstages (considerably larger than the HE400s), but they still sounded like headphones.
I also feel this one has more bass than my earlier HE-400. Just an early assumption. It will take time to dimiss that or not, but so far, I feel the bass to be very satisfying, where last time, I always wanted just a touch more.
edit: Agh, I think I might have to ask for a replacement. The cup labeled R is louder. 5% louder than the other side. I wear them backwards, and the bass is stronger still on the "right" driver. Same thing if I switch channels on the connectors. The "right" is louder.
It's not by much, but changing the balance on my computer to like 95% right channel, evens it out. It's not the cable, for sure.
I'll give it a few days to see if it persists. Man, I'm not looking forward to being without these again.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 11/20/12 at 3:20pm

I tend to agree, but scientifically speaking there is some evidence to support driver break-in, and, unfortunately, no evidence (that I know of at least) to support brain burn-in. I think brain-burn in makes a lot of sense, of course, but it would be a rather tricky theory to test, though it could  be done. To further complicate this mystery, some people hear "brun-in" with some headphones but not with other headphones. I would assume if our brains had to acclimate to every new sound-signature, this process of cerebral or emotive acclimation would occur with greater consistency: it doesn't.  Many folks who hear burn-in with headphone A, will not hear burn-in with headphone B, even when the sound-signature in question is sufficiently novel or a-typical. I don't claim to know the truth here, but I think it's wise to keep an open mind either way you look at it. Both camps are making some rather big claims without a lot of evidence to support their respective cases. Brain burn-in, of course, seems more plausible to most folks, but that doesn't necessarily make it true.

I think you misunderstand me; I'm not a proponent of driver burn-in per say, or of brain-burn in either ( I'm an agnostic on this issue until real evidence rolls in, but note: I do favor the brain-burn in theory). With that said, please understand: folks who make the brain burn-in claim tend to think that they can make such claims with impunity and without the aid of the scientific method, while ridiculing the driver burn-in crowd for lack of evidence; that is the very definition of unfair, friend. The example you use above (in bold) is an example of brain plasticity, which is not really an example of brain-burn in at all, if we are going to adhere strictly to the term as we use it on head-fi. I know this subject is becoming verboden (I apologize for bringing it up again), but I think the point needs to be made. The so-called evidence for brain burn-in is all anecdotal (the same for drive burn-in too, mostly); that's to say, no one has attempted under strict scientific conditions to test this claim. If you know of a journal or scientific study that has tested brain burn-in as it strictly relates to our perception of audio, near-field audio in particular, please send that article to me--I would absolutely love to read it. (And I mean this in earnest too.) So once again, I think we should all keep an open mind on the subject or at least maintain an agnostic attitude. That's all I'm saying. Nothing controversial. Now back to the originally scheduled program: He-400 Love.

Agreed. 
 
If y'all get a chance to preview the new Hobbit "An Unexpected Journey" soundtrack, it is really - and, I do mean really great sounding on the HE-400s.  The soundtrack does not officially get released until December 11th.  However, it really takes the HE-400s into a completely different dimension.  While most of us in this thread realize how capable the HE-400s are with our favorite music being played through them, I felt like when I listened to the Hobbit soundtrack, the sound was very multi-dimensional.  While I've had 5.1 home theaters set up in the past, I grew bored with those configurations and swapped back to 2-channel, 2.1 systems and the headphone rigs.  The LOTR soundtrack on the HE-400s presents itself with a likeness of being in a theater with true surround sound of intense bass, mids and highs working through the various sections of the tracks.
 
I thought I had some previous "ahhhh" moments with my HE-400s, but nothing in the past compared to this recent experience with the soundtrack.  I'm still amazed.  Whew!

Nothing broken thank goodness! But at some point during the festivities, I entered my study to discover my Hd800 box open, the headphones missing! In a panic, I rushed out into the backyard, where everyone was gathered, to see my nephew--a 9 year old crazy kid with wild hair and even wilder eyes--marching through the wet grass like a demented soldier, my headphones on his head, and the cord trailing behind him like some long serpentine tail. My in-laws just thought this was hilarious and kept cheering the little demented solider as he fought off invisible enemies. I had to somehow rescue those headphones without coming off like an evil uncle,but there was no other way: so I just unceremoniously snatched them off his head while everyone looked at me with reproachful eyes. I, of course, said, "Sorry, so sorry," and would have justified my behavior by revealing just how much I had spent on those headphones, but I knew they would be aghast if they ever discovered the truth on that score. So I just departed, mumbling to myself. Everything was a little uneasy after that. This year, I plan to avoid such a episode.

What amp did you use to drive your HD650? Over at Innerfidelity, they claim the HD650 needs only 0.13mW to reach 90 dB.
The HE-400 need 0.33mW to reach 90 dB. So, mW to mW, you need about 2.5 times the power to drive the HE-400's to an equivalent level as the HD 650. You should reach 100 dB with about 10x the power, and this is very very loud. That is about 1.3 mWs if you are using the Senns, and 3.3 mWs with the HE-400. So you can see that the main reason you need more power, or less, is about efficiency of the phones.
I don't subscribe to the idea that a "bass watt" is more difficult than a "1khz" watt. What is relevant is the resistance of the speakers and the power delivery of the amp. If an amp is "weak", it shouldn't affect bass delivery, only loudness. If the bass delivery did suck, it is more likely that the frequency response of the amp is poor, rolling off bass frequencies that you can actually hear. A lot of people probably think bass "always" needs more power, because of car and home audio. Its not that bass NEEDS more power so much as subwoofers tend to be less efficient than other drivers in a speaker system.
If you are driving a 300 ohm load with the HUD-MX1, that's about 10x the resistance occurring at 32 ohms. You would still have 2-3 mWs however - enough to drive the HD 650s, in theory, over 100 dB. @32-50 Ohms, with 26 mWs available, you might hit 108 dB with the HE-400. A bit less with 17 mWs. But the source can affect loudness to a degree, and so can amp gain and other factors. Plus, if the amp can't put out its max power without distortion, you won't make it far before the sound degrades.
The only way to know if its going to work for you is to try it. If the amp section can deliver its max power without audible distortion, or rolling off frequencies, it would seem that, in theory, it can drive the headphones quite decently. My laptop drives my HE-400s quite well, but certainly not as loud as my amp can. But they sounded about the same since the source is the same.Edited by MrMateoHead - 11/25/12 at 4:03pm

About to buy these headphones, but I thought I would ask a few questions first. I purchased HD650s during the sale and I almost don't want to give them away because they were such a great deal. I don't have them yet, but I've been reading about how the HE400s may be a better match to my music preferences.
I listen to a lot of theatrical scores (Hans Zimmer!), Ed Sheeran, Norah Jones, Taylor Swift type of music, and then there's the electronic side of me, listening to all kinds of dubstep. I tend to favor "fun" sounding headphones, but I also want to hear the warm details in acoustic strings and female vocals.
I will also be purchasing a dac/amp combo up to $300.
Based on this information, would the HE400s be a better fit? Or should I stick to the HD650s.
ALSO, I study a lot with my headphones on, and the heavy weight of the HE400s make me worry about facing down at my textbook. Has anyone ever had problems with the HE400s sliding off their head while facing down?
Thanks!

Either is probably a fine choice. For max comfort and a great sound across genres, the Senns are probably a good choice. They will be laid back and "polite", but I have read they are also good at making mediocre recordings sound better. Others on this thread that own them can describe them better.
But I am listening to dub step right now on the HE-400s, and god the extension in the bass is delicious. They are very "fun" in my opinion, but also very balanced, and will do Norah and Hans Zimmer a lot of justice. They are excellent all-rounders, and I listen to a lot of different stuff. I like Sennheiser stuff, and give them the comfort nod, but I can't say I have liked the sound as much as the HE-400s. The 400s have an excellent ease to them, are very transparent, and can really rock out. The "darkness" and "recessed midrange" is hyperbole to me. I would say they have a great attack and slight brightness without being harsh. Feed them some good quality power and enjoy the show.

It happens because the amps are s***. Seriously though, just like a good DAC can be ruined by implementation, a good OpAmp stage can also be ruined by design. That doesn't really say much, however. With low impedance phones you want to look for amps with output impedance less than 2-3 Ohms, and even that is pushing it. The rule of 8 is important because if you combine high output impedance with low input impedance you can screw up the dampening factor, and get that "sloppy" or anemic bass. On that same amp,a headphone working @ 150 Ohms may sound fine - even great!
The same goes for ruthlessly efficient IEM - which not only can get by with practically no power, but then can dampen outside noise by as much as 20 dB. The unusual isolation will make static, pops, and hisses a lot more apparent. Also, the low-impedance drive might reveal problems with channel balance or even distortion present with less volume on the dial (or more likely, distortion with lots of volume on the dial!).
In my opinion, as a consumer of higher-end head audio, the whole industry is frustrating and weird. In car audio, generally speaking, all speakers and Amps are designed to work between 2-4 Ohms. Only a few manufacturers are designing 3 Ohm speakers which actually risk damage if you have the wrong amp, and only subwoofer setups sometimes drop into the 1 Ohm range. In Home Audio, 8 Ohms is relatively standard (6 Ohms for Bose), and 4 is pretty rare except at the high end. So, designing a good amp with the right amount of power is probably pretty well understood, since resistance is generally either going to double, or be cut in half. Headphone amps are conceivably going to drive headphones from 16-600 Ohms, which is a dramatic resistance range. Also, they have to do it with inaudible distortion, and enough power to cover all volume needs.
Given the various factors that matter when it comes to headphone amps, the biggest problem isn't that amps aren't out there. The biggest problem is that they don't give you jack for information to even begin wondering if you've found a good match for your cans (in terms of power / impedance - I assume everyone wants low distortion). I would never by a car audio amp that says it supplies "50 watts between 1-1,000 Ohms" - right, so, 50 watts somewhere in that range. I used to want a Creek Headphone amp, but got tired of the "10mW between 32-300 Ohms".
I knew I wanted about a half a watt of power @50 ohms for the HEs. I knew if I could get that I'd easily drive other headphones also. So I went with an O2. It had published specs that made sense, and it was a lot cheaper than alternatives. Piece of Pie.

Well I used the Fiio E9 to power it, but I tried my old traktor audio 2 dac, which could drive it very loud. But it would sound like absolute crap :) It was as if I could hear all the peaks in the music, but everything else was either inaudible(so very little detail) and the bass was very loose sounding. 
 
I don't know why I thought bass needs more power than other octaves. I thought I saw some graph somewhere that implicated that. I must have misunderstood.
 
I never knew the HE-400 actually needs more power than the HD650, I always thought the HE-400s were quite easy to drive. Apparantly they are only easy to drive relative to other planar magnetics?
 
Anyway The E9 will provide enough power to drive them. But I still don't understand why there is so much information lost even when the spl is loud enough. This must have something to do with the amount of volt/ampere the amp delivers. It must! Let's ask Tyll.
 
Thanks for your wise words :)

Wow.... This thread keeps growing like crazy....
 
I am probably going to get a lot of heat for this post....
 
I received my replacement HE400 approximately 3 weeks ago. Since then, I can't stop listening to all my music collection.
 
As I previously mentioned in this thread, my Fiio E11 weren't sounding good/adequate with these phones. Especially with the combination of high gain setting and bass boost level 1 or 2, bass was completely distorted. Jerg told a very important point.... a good undistorted tight bass is a quality of a good amplifier. That was a really sound advice... thanks jerg. I also tried E9. But wasn't satisfied.
 
Now comes the part where I will receive some heat.... I bought a Yamaha RX-V373 for these phones. Yeah, I know.... It's an AVR. I was just going to try it and was almost looking forward to sending it back. But then I got the receiver in mail and after I plugged the phones in, I haven't removed those till this day. It obviously provides more than enough power. I play almost all my music on -25dB volume level (and this AVR can go up to +16dB) and that's loud enough for hours and hours of music listening experience without any sort of fatigue. I was surprised at the bass response of these phones. Sooooo much potential was just hiding there without the amp.
 
These phones have proven every bit worthy of the praise they are getting here. Now, I listen to most of the songs from my computer.
J.River MC -> (bitstreaming) -> Yamaha RX-V373 -> HE400.
Velours helped with the highs a little. They are also really comfortable for me. Now I can plug my new CD player to Yamaha and keep enjoying the music.
 
This limits me to my desk, yes. But I spend most of my time at my desk and I don't really think that these phones are suitable for portable use.
 
Only word is... wow. Let the criticism about AVR begin....

Well.... about wasting money.... I got them from the egg for $200 (right now they are for $250 but $50 off deal always pops up somewhere). That's cheaper than Objective DAC/O2 combo and you get so many different input options. I also liked the 192/24 dacs (1 dac per channel) on this AVR. Completely neutral/transparent and good resolution.
 
About E9.... well... this may just be me but I didn't find bass response to be that solid and clean. Also the portion of the highs was little toned down. It might be a good thing for HE400 but I didn't like the sound. My observations of E9 might be a little off as I haven't heard a lot of different amps but I know a little something about live music and all....
 

I thought about buying some older ones. But then again thought about all the digital input capability of these newer ones and made the decision. Also the older ones would need separate (and hopefully good) DAC which translates to more money and I was just looking for spending minimum here.
 
Btw, I tried to go up to -5dB but couldn't stay there for more than a couple of seconds. But even then, the sound was perfect. No distortion or anything. Still clear separation, huge clean bass and everything.

The HE-400 are most definitely easier to drive than other planars. If Hifiman improves the efficiency (and sound!) much further, I may never go back to dynamic. But needing 3x the power of an HD 650? That's a heckuva gap when considering High Dynamic Range recordings and the like, where you might easily need a full watt to accomplish what the dynamic drivers can do with a fraction of one.
I don't know about the traktor Audio 2 DAC, but I would suspect that what you were hearing wasn't so much a lack of power as the impact of very high output impedance on low input impedance. I cannot explain this like an expert, but the end result is that you screw up the dampening factor, which can screw up the sound if it is too low. 100 ohms out, for example, is great to keep distortion low feeding in to an amp, but the "rule of 8" would say that it couldn't drive a headphone well unless its impedance was about 800 Ohms. What you were hearing is what happens when dampening is screwed up by a combination of high output impedance and low input impedance.
The E9 is a great amp, but the output impedance is 10 Ohms, making it ideal for headphones rated @ 80 Ohms on up. If it sounds good to you, and the bass isn't "loose", I wouldn't worry. But, ideally, an amp that has an output impedance no greater than, say, 4 Ohms is going to work better with most typical headphones.Edited by MrMateoHead - 11/27/12 at 10:11am

Innerfidelity claims the HD650 needs 0.13mW to reach 90 dB.
They also claim the HE-400 needs 0.33mW to reach 90 dB. So, mW to mW, you need about 2.5 times the power to drive the HE-400's to an equivalent level as the HD 650. Hence my assertion.
Its not that the power requirement of the HE-400 forces you to have a massive amp - it doesn't. For the sake of having adequate volume and headroom however, I think 0.5-1W is necessary.
MarleyBob - I can vouch for the O2 - it kicks butt and has plenty of juice for the HE-400, and virtually anything else you throw at it. The Traktor audio 2 you refer to, according to their website, is rated to drive headphones from 8-600 Ohms, and produce 100 mWs @100 Ohms. Given that, generally speaking, power would double at half that impedance, it should do something like 200 mWs @50 Ohms, and 400 mWs @ 25 Ohms. It depends on the design of the amp, but this suggests to me that output impedance is actually low! So that would explain why it seems to work well with lower impedance phones. But again I am no expert, and without more information about the amp, its hard to know if it should or shouldn't sound great with a variety of phones. But it certainly would have enough power to get loud with HE-400s.
That said, I recommend the O2

Hello all,
 
Sorry if this post is a repeat for any of you.  I asked this at the other he-400 thread, but have not yet gotten any responses.  Thought I'd try over here.
 
I've been sucked into the black hole that is head-fi and lurking for a while now though the endless threads and spending countless hours on research.  I think I finally have come to the determination that the he-400 is what I'm seeking; however, I am not totally sure what I need to complete my setup.  
 
I will use music from the MOG at 320 kbps as my source from both my Galaxy Nexus and PC.  On my pc I have onboard sound which I don't think too highly of.  I would like some portability, so I'm considering the e17/e09k combo.  That way I could use the e17 as a dac when at my PC and use it as an amp for my phone.  The dac in my Nexus does not seem half bad for when I go portable (waiting for someone to hopefully figure out that micro usb issue so I can output to a dac).
 
The other detail here is my father has an old NAD receiver I'm not sure what model, but it has a headphone jack and plenty of inputs on the back.  Is it 1) possible and 2) advisable to output SPDIF from PC to the e17/e09k combo using the e17's dac and the e09k as a preamp then using the rca outputs on the back of the e09k to the back of the NAD receiver for some extra juice? I apologize if this has been answered before, but my search found nothing.
 
Or can someone envision a better alternative?  As I said I would like some portability, but with that said I don't need to be walking around town and would stay mostly confined to a desk while I listen.  Thus, I would be happy to lug around a manageable dac & amp for when I go out of town or when I'm working from the office on weekends.  Money is an barrier.  I'm not looking to spend much more than 650 and would like to make my purchase through Amazon so I can get the 12 month financing.  I'm a poor social worker so its a must.  The only other thing I would say is that I'm hoping this hypotehtical setup would provide some future proofing in that I would be able to drive some other headphones which may be more difficult to drive if I am to expand my collection in the future.  I have the head-fi bug so I'm sure it just a matter of time before I get the itch again.

"Open" needs a third attribute: it needs good treble extension (mainly 12-18kHz) that is relatively flat. HE400s aren't great but are better than most in that aspect.
 
 

It still has peaks and small ringing ridges (around 13kHz) which cause a little tizz, but otherwise it gives the sound signature a lot of air.
 
In comparison, HE500s:
 

 
Notice how it has a pretty big chunk of upper treble missing, that helps give it a very forgiving tonality especially with harsh vocal recordings. However the downside is it contributes to the headphones not sounding as open as something like the HE400.
 
A third comparison would be something like SR007mk2.5, which is reputed to have some of the most airy "materialize-out-of-thin-air" sound possible:
 

 
Notice just how clean, even, and nice the upper treble is extended, and that it is relatively emphasized. The lack of peak/ringing means even with the emphasis it is still not tizzy, and the emphasis relates to how there is huge amounts of air in its presentation.
 
 
Admittedly I have not had a chance to audition high-end STAXs yet, only the Hifiman and Audeze planar lines (all of them), but there is a perfect correspondance with their measurements and my subjective impressions of their treble behavior and "openness", so I thought it'd be fair to extrapolate a bit.

Hopefully someone can give me some much needed assistance here, tried the Recommendations thread multiple times with no avail. I started off considering the Sony MDR-1R and a few similar phones in that range (Momentums and K550's). Quickly found myself escalating to the higher-range headphone market. Things I've heard about the HE-400 have sounded very attractive. Things I value most is neutrality in the sound, openness, distinction in instrument separation, essentially qualities that sound closest to live music (haven't familiarized myself as much as I should with the glossary of sound descriptions yet). Then again, I've also heard things about the HE-400 sounding shrill or sibilant, qualities I am most certainly not looking for. I'm easily off put by 'phones with too much emphasis in the upper register. Are the HE-500's $300 for someone like me? Mostly listen to all varieties of rock, instrumental hip hop, some electronic music, blues, jazz, bluegrass and very little pop. I'm open to most genres though so it's important the headphone be flexible. I'm considering the JSD O2+ODAC and NuForce HDP. How well do the HE-400/500 pair with those amps? Can anyone recommend one of those amps over the other?

Lol, you guys are taking my words a bit too seriously. I wasnt accusing anyone of anything. Relax. Guess I need to add more smileys so people dont overthink what I wrote.
Just saying, the HE500 is one of those that is pretty well known to need some good power behind it, so it confuses me why people would spend 700 dollars on a headphone and settling for 75%. I didnt single Jerg out, because theres plenty of people that do it. They buy 600ohm headphones, and pair it to the E5 and call it a day. Its like...why? Just personally confused.
I dont even bother with the hyperbole behind amps, but I would at least have some form of power behind all my headphones. The E17 is a good amp, but powerful it is not. Hell, even an E9 would be what I would at least have for something like that. Jus' sayan. $700... and a weakish amp. It makes no sense to me, thats all.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/2/12 at 12:38am

Hey Everyone,
 
I posted a question about some headphones to use for xbox gaming, ps3 movie watching and to serve as my one go to pair.  Am settled on the he-400 as one of my top choices, so wanted to see if you guys thought it would work well with my setup.
 
I have a pioneer vsx 1020 receiver, a mits 65 737 tv (no headphone jack).  I am very new to the audio world, and to date have only owned a pair of in ear senheisers that were like $20 bucks, but serve me well on my ipad, so forgive me my noob questions.
 
Will the he-400's sound good plugged into this receiver?  
 
Also, after some advice on the mle gaming headphone guide, I'm not quite sure what the best way to get chat in xbox 360 to come through the headphones.  My idea is to use the antlion modmic and connect it to the xbox controller with a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter and send the audio to the speaker option via the xbox, that way hearing everything through my headphones, and being able to chat through the mod mic.  
 
Would that work well?  Thanks for reading and thanks to PurpleAngel and Evshrug for their input so far

So now I need to order some velours and I am looking to have them shipped to me asap where did you guys get yours how long did it take to ship out? I have amazon prime but no velours on amazon at all haha.

Because the he400 amps easily most amps will power it fine all the way down to the diminutive fiio e17. Of course other amps will work also and they may have a sonic signature that suits you better. I personally don't have any experience with vintage amps but have heard others reports good things about them. You might pm wje on the specific amps that he's used successfully. 
 
Regardless most amps sounds pretty darn good with this hp. I have found that the he400 will stretch a little and give you more with higher powered amps like the like and a nice combination of tubes. BUT...the advantage is modest, and is usually appreciated most by trained ears. 
 
So, the point is the he400 amps easy. That is the way it was designed and it certainly one of it's selling points. I wouldn't spend lot's of dollars looking for a huge improvement because it's just not there. Unless you have some other hard to drive hp's then it would be an expensive exercise with very modest gain. 
 
The he400 can be powered impressively by a fiio e17 which can be had for about $100 used here in mint condition, sports hardware EQ and is also good as a portable.

Just another reason to love the he-400:
 
Some headphones really load the treble with tons of extra energy. Take the Dt-1350 for example: those little portables are surprisingly good,  but c'mon Beyerdynamic! You've really gone overboard with the treble again. Sure, the Dt-1350 is detailed and vibrant, and I love hearing all the little details--brush strokes and all that jazz--so, Bravo! But wait one second, Buster! All the extra energy comes at a serious penalty or two: ear fatigue and artificiality. So don't congratulate yourself just yet.
 
If the 1350 is a four alarm fire (I'm exaggerating here of course), then the he-400 is a crackling camp fire where headphone enthusiasts can huddle on cold and starry nights. Seriously, though, all the 1350's  extra brightness seems so superfluous to me; it merely accentuates or highlights details that should realistically remain subtle. Now the he-400, on the other hand, presents all the details in an unobtrusive way. That's right, it accentuates almost nothing, and yet it omits no nuance. Somehow the he-400 lovingly imparts detail, and air, and an amazing sense of space without overloading the higher frequencies. I've owned the he-400 for nearly three months now, and every week or two, I discover another reason to appreciate these headphones anew.  Thank you, Mr Fang!  Job exceptionally well done.

I've already been through the same issue. If you are already watching movies on them, through your receiver, and you love the sound, save your money. Movies can have a very high dynamic range, and if your current setup is loud enough, it should be more than enough for music listening also. Also, the receiver is going to use higher quality DACs than a lot of headphone amp/DAC combos, which are somewhat more limited.
 
In my case, I went with an O2 amp because my major listening is with a computer. The sound quality is excellent, but the dedicated headphone amp was too weak for all listening conditions (anything with high dynamic range). The O2 is the only amp around the $200 dollar price point which I could find that put out enough power to drive just about anything.
 
If you are really wanting a DAC/Amp combo, I would spring for the ODAC ($285), with all less expensive options I've checked out a distant second. If it had to be cheaper, it would probably be something from Fiio, but in our case, their tendency for high output impedance is not ideal. Just remember that the ODAC, like most DAC/AMP combos, expects to connect from a USB or 3.5mm source.

I'm too used to 120Hz to go back, there's a lot of issues with my current monitor using my Nvidia card because this monitor only has a Displayport in and an HDMI in, and nvidia doesn't seem to play well with DP. I have a friend who has an AMD card that wants to buy my monitor. The price for the ASUS is pretty ridiculous, but it is the best available, plus I've always wanted to try 3D gaming, Nvidia refuses to support my monitor for that, and it would be really nice to watch 3D blu-rays. I've tried a 3D bluray with my current monitor and there was a horrid amount of ghosting and the glasses it came with were very dark. I really wish those 120Hz overclockable Catleaps from 120Hz.net were always available instead of selling in small batches, it's probably worth it to invest in mass producing them, they're 120Hz 1440p monitors for under $500! Even if they were twice the price they would still sell like crazy.

Thoughts of these headphones from someone who has never owned audiophile grade headphones:
OMG, HOLY Ship!! There's soo much BASSS, (*cough* umm, jk. sorry)
They sound better and more accurate than IMAX's 12,000 watts to me.
Gaming with these is incredible, especially if the sounds the game uses are high quality, being surrounded by HiQ sounds is pretty damn nice with these phones' soundstage, imaging, and separation.
I was watching a concert on the Palladia channel and...Wow! With the separation and detail in these phones you can hear every individual clapping, screaming, singing, etc.
I love how low the bass extends, I'm re-listening to my music and hearing a whole new layer to the music I haven't heard before!
The sound in general is incredible, everything is so crisp and perfect sounding, I love the control of Orthodynamic drivers.
What sucks is I'll never be able to go back lol and if I wanted to upgrade, for it to be worth it to me, I would have to spend about double the price! I've officially been sucked into the world and obsession of audiophiles!

Ok well, I got my eagerly anticipated HE-400 today.  Now, my headphone collection includes the Sennheiser HD650 and my favourite closed back headphone the Beyer Dynamic DT 770 Pro.  I particularly like the DT 770s because they get to the heart of the music and present it as a coherent whole.  Anyway, I’ll cut to the chase on this: the first thing I noticed when I put the HE-400 on (before even plugging into my headphone amp) was a cuppy resonance – similar to if I’d cupped my hands over my ears (try it) – none of my other headphones do this, they all damp this resonance out.  On first listening to the HE-400, this cuppines was there and dominated the sound, ie although it was obvious the HE-400s drivers were excellent, there was a lack of cohesion to the music which spoilt the musical experience, in my opinion because of this annoying cuppy resonance.
 
I’m just thinking that maybe so much research and development has gone into getting the drivers right for the HD-400 that the headphone 101 of getting the interface to the ear has been missed.  Thoughts..

Thank you for your response. It does make quite a bit of sense, and I do find it quite noticeable (especially with cymbals and such!). As for the EQ not having much breathing room, you're on point once again. Not only is my EQ not accurate enough in the frequencies I can modulate, it doesn't seem to do too much either. 
 
I do plan on getting an amp in the future (although my audio budget is currently spent). I was thinking of getting to ODAC and then a "warmer" amp. I haven't read up on the O2 amp enough to know if it would fit what I'm looking for and would love to hear other users input on what amp they use and how it affects the high end of the HE-400. When I had my DT990s I paired it with a LD MKIII amp and it really worked wonders in tightening the bass and smoothing out the top end. I think I'd be looking for something similar here.

Quick update: I have received my new dac, the audinst HUD-MX1. I have used its line-out on my active speakers, and its headphone out on my german maestros. 
 
I love it as a dac, but its headphone out is a bit to neutral/analytical for my taste. This is with the gmp 8.35D.
 
I hooked it up to my E9 as a dac, and I do like the sound better this way. The amplified sound by the e9 is much more musical and pleasant. 
Which is why I'm pretty sure the HE400 will sound much better through the E9. 
 
Only two more weeks untill I finally receive the he400s !
 
EDIT: Actually I was wrong, the Audinst HUD-MX1 amp sounds quite a bit better than the e9. The sound is more detailed, better soundstage, and a much tighter bass. I don't know why I thought the E9 was better. A moment of insanity? 
It really is dead cheap then. Outperforms the E7 + E9 by quite a big margin (even more so the E17 + E9).

Fear this may be a double post; preemptive apologies if it is...
Looking to upgrade from my ATH-AD700s. Their highs can be a bit harsh, their bass a bit weak, but I'm basically just looking for Something That Sounds Better. If you're reading this forum, I'm guessing that's not an unknown feeling to you.
My ideal phones would have balanced and neutral frequency response, superb and rock-solid imaging, and a wide and realistic soundstage. When I listen to a string quartet, I love to hear each instrument precisely located, and the bows distinct from the fingerboards, if that makes sense.
I listen mostly to rock, pop, jazz, and classical. In the latter two realms, more often small groups than orchestras or big bands.
I have an audio-gd NFB12, which I use both as a standalone DAC/amp and a DAC feeding a Cambridge Audio Azur amp. I also have a couple FiiO amps and a Bithead floating around somewhere.
My next phones will be strictly stay-at-home and music only; no gaming or movies. Sound leakage is not a problem in my environment.
Budget is flexible, though $400 would certainly be near the top.
Anyway, reading this thread has left me thinking that the HE-400 might be a wonderful step up toward my personal version of audio nirvana. But, before I drop four bills on something I've never heard (I'm reasonably sure no one in Pittsburgh carries HiFiMan), I thought I'd ask for thoughts and advice. Does this sound like a good match?
Thanks in advance for your time and sage counsel.

Terms like "recessed upper mids" are sometimes annoying to hear - as they do not describe much.
 
It is possible to google the common frequency response range of  many instruments, and based on that, find some precision in your assessment of frequency response. Unless you think that your head is the same shape as a test dummies, in all liklihood, the profile presented by testers is not the profile experianced in the "real world" of listening.
 
Straight up piano music is usually a good way to identify the frequencies of offense with any speaker system, as are instruments like a violin. In many cases, I would think the 2khz dip of the phones is more problematic than its 5-10 khz "spike", which starts to reach outside the response of a lot of great instruments and the human voice.
 
Why not challenge your ears to listen to such instruments and try using the EQ to soften the annoying frequencies? I cut mine around 1 khz, and then 3-10 khz. Only 1.5-3dB increments which are barely enough to "hear" immediately. But I find they took a little edge off certain tracks I had found them on.

Hi guys, fast question, (but very important one):
 
Next friday im going to a store to check out the HE-400 (convined the sotre to ship them to the store, then test them). They will have the HE-400 and HE-500 for testing, and i need to know what i should be carefull about (i know they wont have more than 10 hours of burn in, so ill be carefull with my judgement, but apart from that, is there anything i should look for?
 
I am going to be using my cowon i9 and fiio e17 as default testing and probably add an E9 after that. So apart from the headphone beeing a bit too bright at start (and i assume thats where the burn in will come in handy), is there a known issue with some models that i might run into and id have to keep my eye out for (my ear actually).
 
Thx for the advice and wish me luck this friday! :D.

=============================================

I have to chime in, since I have a fair amount of experience with "American Sounds" (albeit typically made somewhere else these days). JBL, Harman, Infinity, Mark Levinson, etc. are all owned by the same group these days but if I had to guess what the key is to "American Sound", I would say, "loud" "proud" and on the bright side.
 
There has never been anything like what I call "recessed" in my JBL's midrange. What you notice more is a present but smooth treble, and a tight and understated bass. If anything, the midrange is airy and spacious, and probably better than 90% of other speakers I have heard. At massive volumes, they are very forward and lose some coherence. If the HE-400s didn't have such excellent low-end extension, they probably would be very close to JBL in terms of sound signature, in my opinion.
 
Anytime you go up the high end, I feel that it gets harder to really distinguish between speakers, because they are tending toward "flat" and "detailed" no matter the brand - since this arguably makes for a more consistent and excellent experience.
 
The HE-400's have an excellent midrange, slightly bright treble, and a "tight bass" which is beautifully textured and even toned. The word "dark" never comes to mind when I listen to my JBLs or to these. Dark are my old Senn HD 485s, which seem detailed until they are pushed a little, and then the dark "veil" keeps a lot of sound out of the equation.
 
For those of you that can't take the fatigue, I have two solutions. The first is, make sure you get the tilt and swivel of the cans right (Thanks Jerg). The second is, play with the EQ! The one I have currently settled on is below:
 

 
I just assume that others' measures of the phones are correct, and I attempt to smooth out the 1 khz bump, and then work the treble down from about 2.5khz to 10k. Since I did these two things, I've noticed a bit more comfort in longer term listening.

Listening to the HE-400 as of now.
*USING PLEATHER*
No Fatigue.
Treble is a bit recessed.
Bass not as loud as i thought it would be, but the extension is way better than any headphones i've ever tried.
Separation and detail is clearly amazing.
Black background
Resolution on these are stellar.
Cans are very very very open. When i put them on, it sounds like it only suppresses 5% of sound from that of bare ears. (I can watch/hear tv while having headphones on)
Not very neutral, more of a fun laid back sound (however not too laid back)
Best way to describe it, they sound like Audioengine A5+ speakers made into headphones with less bass.
0 hour burn in by the way, opened the box and immediately connected them to my NuForce Icon HDP w/ Sigma 11 PSU
Will listen for about 10 hours before switching to Velour pads which i have in hand. 
I don't know, but by looking at the pleather & velour, i can tell the velour will be better for my ears (in term of sound quality) Looks like it would give better treble due to it being less enclosed. (stitching)
UPDATE: Sounds better than my AKGQ701 & Sennheiser HD650.
It's a little darker, and not as full sounding as the HD650. HE-400 makes me miss less of the HD650's smooth sound signature.
Gives me enough treble but not overflowing treble like the AKG Q701. treble hurts my ears somewhat (fatigue)

For giggles, I decided to try the old velours on the he400 tonight. You know the ones with the nasty white teeth? Guess what? They fit!! It was frustrating getting the first one on but the second went one easily once I had the hang of it. 
 
Here is the low down. I believe these pads came with my original pair of of he500's, but not really sure. The left side is a perfect fit but the right pad sits just about a 1/16th away from the hp on one edge. Once the hp is on the gap goes away. I don't know the reason for the gap other than maybe the pad is bent just a touch. The comfort is very nice!! Certainly better than the new stock velours. 
 
The Sound: Call me crazy but to my ears the mids are better...smoother. Bass is a touch tighter with all the original impact. AND...I do believe that the tizz is tamed. Not bad...not bad at all for a freebie pair of pads that were just collecting dust.

Thanks for the tip Matt.
The more i listen to the velours, the more i think about finding a place to throw away the pleathers pads.
As listening continues the entire night, i realize HE-500 isn't for me. (I've heard it recently from a studio friend)
I guess my quest now is to find something nearly identical to the HE-400.
Something with a little more treble (but no fatigue) and comfort would be the epitome of what i think a headphone should sound like.
More detail and separation would be even better, but for where the HE-400 stands, imo, it's already at the top of the charts in those areas.
At first i thought the bass could be a little louder, but the more i listen, i become more satisfied of it being where it is. I guess my preference for bass has changed after listening to these.

The ratio can well be 70/30 depending on your sound signature preference :D
 
I just got the HE-400 yesterday so it's a quick first impression with fews hours of burn-in. I did not feel the HE-400 bass was much better or prominent than that of the HE-500 (when properly driven).
What I did feel, however, is a recess in the mids, especially in the vocals range which make it sound more "heavy" . By comparison, the HE-500s do sound more open and fuller in this area. The 400s don't quite have the magic mids of the 500s.
The treble quantity is a bit more that adequate for me (I'm used to the smooth treble of the 500s), I hope it will tame up a bit with burn-in.
 
The interesting point, however, is that it does not require a powerfull headphone amp to show its true potential. I really (REALLY) enjoyed it on my Fostex HA-A3! The sound signature reminded me of that of the HE-500 when driven with the (slightly) warm SA-31 amp. 
 
For $800, this is a Killer combo!
 
I will still give it time to burn-in and try to adjust to the change in sound signature and give a proper feedback.
 
Note: the pleathers were replaced with velours, of course :D. The pads that came with it are a bit flabby, more so than the pleathers that came with my HE-500...

I noticed the same thing and just returned my HE400's, I listen primarily to rock and noticed during several songs that the vocals in the track seemed to be recessed while the high hat was overpowering.  I think turning them up to hear the vocals caused the highs to give me tinnitus which I now have and won't go away.  I've never had tinnitus from a hp before and don't listen at excessive volumes.  I would love to see a real frequency graph to get a visual on what I am hearing to confirm it.  I bought some HD600's based on a recommendation and to my ears they have better balance across the frequency spectrum.  Interestingly I play bass guitar and I feel that the HD600 more accurately portrays what I hear coming out of my bass amp than the HE400 but then again I'm not a dubstep or hip hop guy and am not fond of synth bass.  I had rev. 2's btw.

I got the one with white plastic rig, don't know which revision it is. I suppose they only send rev.2's now?
 
I listen mainly to rock (and its derivatives) as well. The Wall is in my burn-in playlist so I could listen briefly to few tracks of the album and this is clearly apparent. I think "muffled" is the best adjective to describe the vocals I hear... That's a shame, this album is pure wonder with the HE-500 :'(
 
I didn't recall the HE-4 to sound in a such way on rock... The mids were recessed too, but they were not so "muffled". That's too bad, the 400s are clearly the better headphones in a technical standpoint but I'm not sure I can get used to its tonal balance :/
 
I sent the 4s for repair (one earcup literally detatched itself from the head-band...) but when the replacement pair comme back I might do a quick round-up review between the 3, with the new velour pads, of course (I have 5 pairs).

All this talk about recessed mids and muffled mids genuinely baffles me. True the upper midrange recession (or whatever one may choose to call this sort of tuning) most certainly affects the presentation of female vocals a little, and I most certainly understand why folks might complain about that, but that's the extent of my understanding; male vocals, on the other hand, have more presence and energy than I've heard on any other headphone. Period. That's right: it has more presence than even the hd800 or the he500. Now I suppose, if your thing is the upper mid-range, and all the harmonics that fall into those registers, then indeed the he-400 will sound a little uninspiring, perhaps even a little veiled (though that's not how I would describe it). But to say that the he-400 has recessed mids is a little misleading, imho (note: I'm not referring to anyone in particular here--I'm just trying to address this recessed mids business). The Denon D2000's have recessed mids; the Beyer DT770's have recessed mids. And for the record, I just wouldn't put the he-400 in the same category with those headphones. I say all this for the benefit of folks who will read "recessed mids" and instantly think "the he-400 is not for me then."

This is not how I heard it and I won't take it back. At the moment, male vocals (I didn't try female for now) sound distant and muffled, which makes the presentation "heavy". You can get similar result when you turn up the subwoofer on a cheap 2.1 system while watching movies: the speech is hard to understand (again, the sound is heavy).
 
Either you have a very special pair of HE-400 or I have a faulty one, in my case, there is no comparison with my 500s in this regard. Period.
 
The HE-400 are just too dark for me for the moment. I might end up loving it as much as I love the 500s if something happens during burn-in, but for now, at least for the pair I have (which might not be the same as everyone's. Hifiman already showed some inconsistencies in their manufacturing process), the voicing is not entirely to my liking.

Definitely the HE-500 for the mid's when looking back at all the people who's had both.
Now that i feel as if my HE-400's are burned in more, there is a slight lack of mid/treble. (IMO) 
The resolution and swiftness of these planar headphones blows all my headphones out of the water. 
Biggest downfall that i've realized again and again that haunts me is the weight of these things. (Heavy) 
They aren't so comfortable, but they will make up for it in music production. 
I'm already using it over all my other headphones 80/20 ratio. Would be 90/10 if these things weren't so dang stiff/heavy. 
Jeeez... Can't wait for the HE-500 to come in Saturday.... Even heavier...  ouchies.

Will have to buy the Schiit Magni or Lyr also.
Orthodynamic headphones need more current to sound good. Perhaps after the amp, the HE-400 will improve further.  Fingers crossed.

No offense taken, don't worry :p
 
My dad sould have the new Cohen in his library, I'll have to check. I do have the Field Commander Cohen, I will try this one. Funny enough, this particular live album was among my favorites back when I got my first dedicated DAC (NFB-3.1) and, first and foremost, my first planars (HE-4)! The voice, though distant in the case of HE-4, was just gorgeous!
 
I think my first impression was not that great because I listened to a particular song of The Wall that highlighted this little """"flaw"""". Maybe The change in sound signature was too abrubt because of that?
Anway, when I listen to Dire Strait or, even, Wish you were here, I don't hear the "heavy voice". It certainly does not have the magic of the HE-500 (I just prefer its voicing, that's not really surprising) but I didn't take it as a "flaw".
 
I will give it more time, anyway ;)

Change your sig, dangit! 
I may end up selling the ODAC very soon too, depending on how well the Modi stacks up. I frankly don't hear almost anything worth noting between the ODAC, NFB5, and E17, as well as the very lowly Fiio D3 (other than the D3 crapping out on me soon after comparing). So as long as a DAC isn't pure crap, they all sound so very much the same to me. I don't even need the Modi, but the Magni looks sad alone without it's sibling. If it's even within a hair close to the ODAC, the ODAC is gone. Don't need two USB DACs, and the ODAC doesn't exactly fit with my setup. I mean, it's well hidden...
In any case, the Modi/Magni are mine. The SA-31 is gonna be a little harder to give up, but I just might. That X1 or K702 65th are just screaming at me.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/13/12 at 5:02am

It's more as an alternate use. The HE400 isn't the best for gaming, and they're finicky when using them while laying down. Just a little bit of my pillow covering them really affects SQ. I play a lot while laying down, which is a double hit against the HE400.
The new K702 65th Anniversary seems to be getting glowing reviews and praise over the older AKGs, so I really wanna try them.
Then there's the Philips Fidelio X1, which is considered to be like a mix between the HD650 and something more lively, which sounds like something I really wanna try. A bassy, open headphone is rare 'round these parts, and I can only buy the DT990 SO many times (I've owned... 6 or was it 7?)
I'm leaning on the X1, but Philips is being real shady to America right now. Only one place has them in stock, and it's a bit too expensive ($420), when the UK has been getting them for the equivalent of $300-350.
The HD650 is a perfect alternative to the HE400, but I REALLY wanna try something new. If all else fails, I will be getting the HD650 again and calling it a day. That is, unless someone magically makes a D7000 equivalent with velours.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/13/12 at 5:33am

In the process of ordering the Magni, I looked at their FAQs, and it seems clear that they do reclock, and, of course, that they are familiar with all these issues.
 
It's interesting that both Schiit and HRT consist of:
 
* Electronic designers previously from high-end companies making expensive audio gear
* Now trying to make the best audio gear per dollar for customers on a budget
* In Southern California
* Using wireless assembly techniques allowing them assemble in-house instead of in Asia
 
Despite that similarity, one group emphasizes the dubious aspects of USB, but then has circuitry to eliminate the problems introducted by the supported toslink connection, while the other group emphasizes the dubious aspects of toslink, but then has circuitry to eliminate the problems introducted by the supported USB connection.
 
And then you have Benchmark which says it doesn't matter which one you use, because we are going to reclock it anyway.

Like a big dummy, I sold off my HE-series balanced Canare cable.  I have the supplies to make a new one, with the exception of the sleeving that I've ordered and is supposed to arrive on or before this Saturday.  However, we have a headphone meet on that day and want to pack my HE-400s, but fret I may have to use a jury rigged cable as I don't want to assemble a cable, then rip it apart to install the jacket material.  Grumble ...
 
While I do miss my HE-400s, since they've essentially been on the headphone rack for a bit more than a week, I do have the AKG K167 Tiesto to keep me occupied.   Though, I want to get my HE-400s back up and running so I can make a decent comparison, the K167s are a great, closed bass-producing headphone.  The bass isn't just a "one note" bass maker either.  It is detailed and makes my ears happy.  I'm still breaking in the K167s, too, so until they've had a few weeks of burn-in time, I'm reluctant to provide a real critical review at this point in time.

So, I spent 1 hour listening to vocals with the HE-400 yesterday.
 
I stand by my first impression: the sound is dull with male vocals (especially lower registers like Leonard Cohen). The recess in the mids (right after the lower-mids region, I suppose) make the overall voice lack clarity.
 
I also listened to female voice (Norah Jones' - Not too late & Wish I could). This is better, it doesn't fall in the lower-mids so does not exhibit the aforementioned "flaw". The clarity is good but it sounds a bit "thin" (due to its dark signature).
 
One thing I also noticed is a bit of "distortion" along with Norah Jones' voice. I don't know if the mids actually distort or if the treble emphasis brings out some sort of recording artifact? I notices this with Led Zeppelin as well.
I don't hear such things on the Norah Jones case with the HE-500. However, the 500s brings out all the recording flaws in the 3 albums of Led Zeppelin (more so than the 400s, which are less resolving).
 
I also stand by my first conclusion: the HE-500 easily outclass the HE-400 in all aspects, except maybe the bass (that's more a matter of taste than pure performance difference though). It is more musical (the sound is lush & full), performs delightfully with any genre and is a better all-rounder (due to its more neutral signature).
 
I will try to play with EQing a bit, which is hardly (if at all) a concern for me, if it can fix the issue.
 
To be continued ;)

I think what he means is that people that are on the early days of their Head-fi journey will try to match the prices of their gears. Those for which the HE-400 is the best (most expensive) headphone they've ever owned, might not already own +$1000 amps to pair it with. 
You definitely don't belong to this category. According to your sig, you seem more advanced in your journey. In the present case, you're more the kind of Head-fier who would try the HE-400 "for fun" just to see how far $400 can get you compared to the +$1000 headphones you already own. In your point of view, you see no reason why you should not use the +$1000 amps you own with it (and you would be wrong not to use them :D). I bought the HE-400 for the very same reason, though I didn't quite reach the same level of prices (my gears are more in the $500-700 range, each).

Fascinating. My impressions (with male vocals in particular) are exactly the opposite of yours. I spent a few hours myself A/B ing the he-400 and he-500 and Lenard Cohen sounds absolutely, unequivocally amazing, and in no way does he or any other male with a commanding voice sound in the least bit dull. It's the same with Nick Cave, Beck, Brenden Parry (Dead Can Dance fame), Lou Reed, Danzig, Tom Waits, and even Andrew Bird and Tom Yorke. All these guys to varying degrees sound fully realized, alive, nuanced and crackling with energy--and that's a wide rage of male voices too. And yes, the he-400, to my ears at least, genuinely outperforms the he-500 with regard to most male vocalist but falls far short with female vocalist almost every time. Now maybe my gear isn't expensive enough to tease out the differences in the low and mid-low frequencies between theses headphones, but I do have 3 amps: the fiio e9, the Little Dot MkIII, and a vintage Kenwood receiver, and none of these amp choices can change the he-400's or he-500's low-end and low midrange reproduction, especially with male vocalist. Also, (I've mentioned this before) the he-400's sound-stage is more holographic and coherent to my ears.  Now, I'm in no way saying the he-400 is better than the he-500 (it certainly is not), but to my ears, the he-400 excels in a few choice areas, while the he-500 does everything right at the expense of excelling in one or two focused areas. Different folks, different ears, I guess, but the disparity between our impressions is rather dramatic. Maybe I have a special he-400 after all. (I still have my rev 3 btw ) Or maybe this is just another headphone mystery.

Got the HE-400 like 20 minutes ago running.
Ok, so is it tear-dropping? no
Is it a revolution? No
Is this headphone something i would recommend to everyone? No
Would i give it as a gift? No
 
 
 
Will i return them to the store? HELL NO!
 
From my Fiio E17+Sennheisers HD380 this is not exactly an "upgrade", its a new tier. I get 100% waht HIFIMAN means by planar Magnetic.
 
Its a bit diffrent from what im used to and yet from the first 3 minutes i tested them, i cant take them off (bare in mind that thou i am FAR more used to another sound signature, this is addictive).
 
I am a total noob when it comes to using terms like "bright", "warm", etc.
For me, this can is quite simply a strong contendant to my Z-5500 speakers, and even those are not the best you can buy, i love them.
 
I an very thankfull to HIFIMAN for producing those at such an affordable price (yes, for me they are affordable if i compare to quality).
 
I thank you all Head-Fi.org for keeping up the good work. I cannot stress enought how helpfull everyone has been on this site, not only giving good advice, but also allowing me to make my own "informed decision".
 
I jsut ****** hope the mayans are wrong about the end of the world, cus even thou my ex still is missing and i want the world to burn (joker type), i really want to enjoy these cans for long, very long.

I forgot, about one question that pops up a lot:
 
HOW DOES THE FIIO DRIVE THEM?
 
Well i tried at the store both the E17 with my comow i9 and then they connected it to their Icon HDP i think it was.
 
There was a definite difrence, BUT i was running crappy mp3 (really bad mp3 if you ask me) compared to tubular bells from a cd.
 
I will comment later on since i mainly got them for gaming.
 
But the Fiio i belive was not the ONLY limiting factor (the volume off my laptop with the fiio at max is INTOLERABLE).
 
For me the money as of today is well spent, and at the store they asked me to come with them once the burn-in is done (and since there is a nice girl there you know i will :D).
 
i am now running papa roach cd in my laptop and its the first time in my life i enjoy songs i found a bit boring. 
 
But as i said, more on this later.

First time poster, long time lurker here.
I don't know if it is common knowledge, but I just wanted to give a heads-up to anyone interested in third party pads, that the pads that Beyerdynamic sells as "replacement pads for old-style DT990" fit the HE-400 perfectly without any modding. I ordered these to spice up a pair of very beaten vintage DT990s and was very surprised that the pads fit on my HE-400.
Along with the pads I had also ordered some foam plate replacements, which turned out not to be needed on the vintage DT990. However, these come in very useful when using the Beyerpads on the HE-400, as with some patience they can be inserted into the pads after installing them on the HE-400 pad ring. This will result in a near perfect replacement pad for the HE-400.
For anyone interested, part numbers below:
1x Replacement Pads EDT 990 V 926679
2x Foam Pad 910236

=============================================



To my ears they sound nearly identical to the original Hifiman Velour pads (which I both find superior to the pleather pads). I prefer the comfort, since the Beyerdynamic pads just seem to fit my ears better. I will be keeping these on the HE-400 and will have to order another set for the DT990 that I wanted to replace 
The foam pad is needed with this type of Beyerdynamic pads, as they do not contain any protective layer in the middle, since otherwise they would not work with the original vintage DT990. Check this picture below:
(Photo by vid on head-fi)
When putting them onto the HE-400 plastic rings, you may need to apply a bit of pressure with a blunt object to bend the pads a bit. They fit very well once they are on. The manual that came with the Beyer pads suggest to heat them up a bit with a hairdryer to make them more elastic. 
  
=============================================
Topic: 8958260 in thread 604583
=============================================



Sadly I left the velour pads with the nude DT990 at the office. If it helps, I got the pleather ones to compare at home:
Right now the Beyerdynamics pad is actually slightly thicker than the pleather Hifiman pad, but they are known to get a bit thinner over time.. so what you explained might be possible.
If needed I can compare them again with the velour ones next week.

I think they are the same, when searching for the replacement parts on the German Beyerdynamic website it also suggested me the black one as fitting.
For anyone looking to do this mod, here is a picture of the back of the finished pad:
As you can see the elastic parts fit fine over the plastic ring from the HE-400 if you are patient enough and maybe revert to the hairdryer method as suggested by Beyerdynamic.
If you look closely at the holes you can see that this is how I inserted the foam pads into the thing. I started with one side and then used a small plastic toothpick to adjust the foam pad and keep it centered in the cup. I kept adjusting the pad through the holes in the plastic-ring to avoid any bulges. This is the most painful thing about the mod but should be done within a few minutes as well.Edited by tomatolicious - 12/14/12 at 4:45pm

Actually, when I do get the momentum rolling, it will be an "open source" project.  I'll try to get the patterns and links to the hand sewing tools, as well as the processes documented in detail.  Then, members can follow the source to proceed with taking the information and building their own custom pads.  In regards to the Denon pads from J$, the sound could come back into range if maybe 3/8" of an inch were sliced from the foam to make the outer pad depth, not so far away from the drivers.  However, this is where all the good stuff starts happening - when the group collaborates and understands what it is that might be the strengths and weaknesses in an offering.  From that, will come something great that will fill the void as to what is not available at the moment.  Then again, Matt has his irons in the fire, too, and might have good news in the next several weeks on a good offering to provide us with what we're looking for.  But, to me, working on a project and wrapping it up with success does provide one with a great feeling.

More than a few people have mentioned this same quandary.  However, if one looks at how Audeze angled their connection points at the bottom of the headphone cups, I wish HifiMAN would consider a similar option, too.  While they are at it, it would be great if they were able to switch over to the mini XLR connectors like Audeze, too.  The mini XLRs are quite ideal and have a locking mechanism.  They don't twist loose like the HifiMAN connectors, and the HifiMAN connectors are of the SMC type, and a bit harder to get your hands on as opposed to mini XLR connectors.  Heck, even if they wen't with the slightly larger SMA connectors, it would be better, too, as the SMA connectors seem to have more availability, too.
 
With that aside, getting the SMC connectors is not entirely impossible as HifiMAN sells them, as well as Double Helix Cables for about $12.00 a pair, plus shipping.

Yes, actually another member pointed me in that direction, too. I was impatient and wanted to get moving on a few varieties of cables. Fortunately, I only have a small amount of impatience. Yet, for other things, I can wait without any issues. Even in a large metro area, it was impossible to get some SMC connectors. I could find the SMA, but not SMC. Go figure.

Yes, you are correct. I remember one of my cables did have the markings. I'm just not sure that did when it came to running the leads off of the yoke. I think if one were to take a HifiMAN SET cable and move ahead with trying to go with a balanced connector option, they might have to tear the cable up a bit to do so. In that case, buying some new Canare cable is a cheap option that will yield good results. I buy plenty of Canare for my hobby headphone cables.

Darryl,
I was a good meet. Missed seeing you there. There were probably on 2/3rds as many people as our last one back in late spring / early summer. Justin did have the GS-X amps there. The top covers were removed and things looked orderly and just plain beautiful. Justin explained how the 4-pin connector can be used, or if someone is using two 2-pin 1/4" jacks for their balanced connectors, those jacks are on the front panel, too. The only amp of Justin's I happened to hear was his Pico Power, which is hitting the streets quite soon. The Blue Hawaii driving the STAX was quite popular and had someone at the station basically the whole time there, so I didn't get into the chair to take it, nor the GS-X, next to it, for a spin. I had my chance to hear the Mad Dogs with the leather dog padz, some AT M50s, Grado HF-1, and had a lot of discussions on the HifiMAN HE-400 vs. the HE-500.
It was great for the dialog and to meet more members and discuss what we love. In the end, I never felt like I yearned for any new items or gear, though. That's probably a good thing, because when I got home, my wife reminded me that we just got another $9,000 bill for the next semester of our daughter's college. Man, children are expensive and sometimes our hobbies have to take a back seat. However, I'd rather do with a bit less in my hobby in order to see my daughter push ahead with a great education. Bah!

I took some time today to go through all of my headphones to make absolute of what i would keep and what i will end up selling.
Listened to them for 4 hours.
FIRST to leave would be the AKG. Bass is nice and punchy, treble is good, but the highs are too screechy for my ears (too harsh). Sound stage is nice, however they are not forward enough for me, the person singing seems to be more distant than compared to other headphones.
Main Reason for selling: Harsh Treble
Reason worth keeping: Looks niceSECOND to leave would be the Sennheiser HD650. It's very detailed, but a little too smooth for my taste. When its playing low and mid vocals, it sounds forward enough. The sound is well rounded/full. However when things go mid high and high, there is a large gap of recessed treble. Music is all around my head, i prefer something more centralized.
Main Reason for selling: Too smooth, recessed highs, too forward at times, and a little full.
Reason worth keeping: Very great headphone to fall asleep to, very comfortable, detailed yet smoothTHIRD to leave will probably be my HE-400. It's overall quality is very much like the HE-500, however in some categories, the HE-500 just excelled better in(i finally understood why people said so). Both headphones are well centralized and forward. the HE-400 being a little tad darker and less neutral. Bass is more aggressive on the HE-400 than the HE-500, but when using the HE-500's silver cable, its harsh bass was improved significantly, however, the HE-500 was still better by a quarter mile. Treble on the HE-500 was better, no doubt about it. Separation & Transparency, the HE-500 wins also.
Main Reason for leaving: Too close to the HE-500 and loses in important categories
Reason Worth Keeping: IT IS FUNNER THAN THE HE-500. I don't know how to explain it, but sometimes i get random frequency jumps in both bass and treble on the HE-400 AND ITS FREAKING AWESOME! It's like a freaking ninja. WITH THE HE-500's SILVER CABLE, THE TREBLE IMPROVED, THE BASS SOUNDED LESS HARSH. (I've never been a believer when it came to better cables, now i am)HE-500 > HE-400 > Sennheiser HD650 > AKG Q701
96% > 90% > 85% > 75%HE-400's with silver cable = 93% (percentage shows how good it is in terms of grade, 90%+ = A Grade)
This is all MY OPINION while running from the NuForce Icon HDP w/ Sigma 11.
Tested on my friend's Asgard as well, still doesn't change my opinion of the headphones.
I bet each headphone's sound would improve if i test them with my Xonar Essence One Muses Edition.
I'm happy i found a near perfect headphone (HE-500) - High Hopes of finding the 100% one day. Might be the LCD-2 or LCD-3

Thanks Wayne 
There are three types of people who have audio interest.1. Those who buy numerous headphones for that "different/unique signatures". The ones who likes to change up the game, experiment, very much like my sex life before marriage.2. Those who buy headphones in high hopes of finding "The One" headphone. Once they find it, or something close to it, they will mainly use that one headphone.3. Those who are too poor to buy any type of audio equipment.
I'm number two. I realized that i only prefer 1-2 headphones at a time, but listening will all be centralized over one type of sound, so if it's two headphones, they need to sound at least 90% the same.
That's why i chose the HE-500 and HE-400. Both are at least 90% alike in my opinion, just with the HE-500 being overall better in treble/mids/bass extension. HE-400 i decided to keep because they bring out the funner side of the HE-500. Notwithstanding the fact that they are insanely close one using the HE-500's silver cable (no joke, try it). So when i want to be a little bit like number one, i'll switch to the HE-400 for awhile. Pretty much like cheating with your wife but always coming back to her.
I don't think i'll ever be able to get the Audeze LCD-2. Doubt i'll pay $800-$1000 for a 2-3% gain (to my ears). If i did, i'd have to sell both of my headphones. (Broke College student)

I believe you heard my HE-400s at the meet.  They are the Version 2 variety, and had a quick cable that I assembled this morning, so that I could get the headphones to the meet.  I had the black heavy felt discs that could be inserted into the pad, so a user could see if the sound changed a bit, or not.  Some members did comment that they preferred the HE-400s without the felt.  But, when I use them, I can't hear how the felt provides any type of veil towards choking the sound.  But, all of our ears are different.
 
I had a chance to hear my HE-400s, too, while using various sources, amps, etc.  At home, I drive them with a Yamaha integrated 2-channel amp.  I have some control over the frequency to "tune in" or "tune out" some of the frequencies in order to make every attempt to perfecting the sound.  However, on all the portable setups, my HE-400s didn't sound anywhere near as good as what I can listen to at home.  I had played in the arena of dedicated headphone amps, etc. in the past for portability.  But, I've realized I don't tend to use the HE-400s out of the home and the smaller gear would just sit on the shelves.
 
If you get a second chance, see if you can hear the headphone again, but using a different source and / or amp.  The issue might be what you're feeding it, and if there is an issue with the source, or the amp, it could be deterring you away from something that could be good.

True. That's what makes this a dangerous hobby. Especially for those of us who don't have exorbitant budgets. What I've come to realize is that I don't need the top tier, ie he6 and hd800, to be happy and get all the enjoyment I need from this hobby. I've been a huge music lover since I was a kid. Headphones have allowed me to bring a new level of enjoyment to the music that I love so much. And I'm perfect happy and certainly more comfortable at the mid-fi level where I get 90-95% of the fidelity at a fraction of the cost. And for me it all comes down to the enjoyment of the music. 
 
I won't say that I'll never make any more headphone changes...we all know that would be a lie. But I'll say that my enjoyment of the hobby is off the charts good right now with the three hp's that I own.

Well put, Matt. I've come to realize that I'm even happy with lower tier equipment with higher tier headphones.
IF the Magni/Modi satisfy me enough, I may even sell my SA-31 and ODAC, and keep the HE400 + either the HD650, K702/65, or X1. That's all I could want.
My original plan was to downsize to bare essentials, but somewhere I ended up spending over $600 just on the SA-31 alone. 
I originally wanted the Bifrost+Asgard (gotta love the stacked look), but so many people said the Asgard wasn't great, and I certainly didn't wanna spend $450 for a USB Bifrost. The Magni+Modi is basically what I would've wanted when I first got the E9. Something functional, and pleasing to the eyes. 
I'm perfectly happy with the ODAC as my DAC, with the exception that it's not pleasing to look at (i.e. it's so small and hides behind my SA-31, lol). The Schiit stacks would please me on more than a sonic level.
I really wish Schiit brought out some higher end SE amp that is like an upgraded Asgard, and maybe a DAC that is between the Bifrost and Modi in price. I'd go for that. A $500-600 setup.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/16/12 at 5:41am

I also listened to Wayne's HE-400s yesterday (through my Lyr). I liked the way the bass was powerful, but well-resolved and the crisp transition between the lows and mids--which seems to be a planar thing. I did hear that bit of tizziness in the treble and I think the problem is that the mids are detailed, but a little laid-back compared to that upper sizzle. For fans of a u-shaped sound signature, this is a very nice headphone, but if you want to bring the mids forward with some volume, that tizziness will be out in front. I have a feeling that some carefully done EQing could do wonders.
The HE-500 balances out the sound more, but the HE-400 seems pretty close considering the price jump. The HE-500 was a nice match for the Lyr and surprisingly--was nearly unlistenable on the Mjolnir--very harsh. The HiFiman planar sound really comes together in the HE-6, the beautiful signature airiness is there, without any of the issues that hold the lower models back. Overall, I thought it was a nice line, with a very distinct sound signature. The build quality was better than I expected, although the headbands really need some extra padding.
The Lyr has very good synergy for the HE-400/HE-500 and the warmth of the tubes complements the sound signature. I'd steer away from any solid state amps that tend towards a brighter sound.Edited by Barry S - 12/16/12 at 6:13am

Darth, you may have the equivalent of a Asus Xonar card built in, if your MoBo is the "republic of gamers" edition that a quick google search revealed. There is also effort, in that case, to provide better than normal S/N and isolation of the audio stream.
 
Personally, I would get the phones first and try them with your onboard audio, which uses a very good TI OpAmp and can drive higher impedance headphones. In most cases, people need to take control of their audio settings in Windows, which, oft ignored, sound like crap on high end headphones by default. The main offense is usually DSP stuff that is great for cheap speakers, but needs to be shut off for hi-fi! Then, if you don't find it to your liking, I would get the Magni and save money on the DAC, which I doubt will make a world of difference in your sound.

If you don't have a DAC, i recommend both the modi and magni as a desktop/laptop pair. (But if you're on the move a lot with the laptop, i recommend the Fiio E17)
Without a standalone DAC, the sound from the realtek chip via 3.5mm to RCA on the magni will sound very distorted. So if you have a HE-400 in hand, buy the magni and hear it for yourself. The DAC makes worlds difference.
Magni will work with both HE-500 & 400. My friend (who bought one) said it isn't clear,seperated, or transparent enough for the HE-500 so you're not getting the complete value that you paid for if you had something like the HE-500/Magni Combo. It's pretty obvious that a $99 Amp isn't going to bring out the best of a headphone with 7 times the cost.. THE-400 is easier drive by 10-15% or so IMO, should be good enough.

I haven't tried the rubbish bin mesh, when I saw it in store it seemed a bit too fine so I kept looking around for a more open one.
This one basically has the same sound as with no grills on at all, I can't notice any difference. I would say its the same with the rubbish bin mesh too.
I had no grills on at all for about 3 weeks and at one stage I decided to put them back on, I lasted about an hour before I had to take them off again.
You can perceive the sound coming from within the headphones rather than it being very open and female vocals are not as deep sounding as they are with the grills on.
I also heard some distortion in the mids for the first time, people had mentioned this but I had never heard it before but I did when I put the grills back on (maybe I was drunk though).
To me, having the grills off is a very similar effect as the velour pads have, but even more so.

My HE-500s, and HE-5LEs?  Yes.  I sold them.  Why?  I don't know.  I can be stupid at times.    I think what drove me to do it was the fact that I had been trying to rig up my system for multiple purposes.  I'd also try and use a portable amp, which didn't do as well with the higher juice requirements.  However, I've grown to realize that I really only care to use my HifiMAN headphones with my main system, in my study and never as I'm trying to float around our home.
 
Yes, I'm torn.  Very torn.  I also love my AKG K167 Tiesto headphones, but they are within the return window.  So, my thoughts (hopefully not too irrational) would be to sell off my HE-400s and return the K167s.  I could then afford to move back to a HE-500 or HE-5LE.  Yet, in considering the move back, I wouldn't want it to be a stupid move.  Clearly, with my system (gear, source, etc.) there was an awfully good reason, at the time, for me holding onto the HE-400s and not the others.  I just can't remember exactly what it was - other than the "fun" flavor that the HE-400s offered.  Yet, the HE-400s with a few adjustments here and there, are very capable at giving my ears the love that they need with music.

Unfortunately, I don't listen to any trance music.  But, the AKG K167 Tiesto is a "fast" headphone that can really keep up and not lag.  As to the merits of the various items that people have pointed out in the K167 thread, we've seen that a lot of people have added comments.  Some  have thought the product is great, while others have been picking at certain aspects of it apart.  I think one really needs to see and hear them to determine whether it might be love or hate.  But, with the music and blues that I listen to the bass is *stellar*.  I don't just mean that it has an apparent or abundant amount of bass.  But, it has a great amount of quality bass - with layers that allow you to easily separate instruments, etc. as you go through your musical journey.   My Fostex headphones have great bass, but as to being able to separate it into delicate layers, that is the hard part as it isn't quite as capable in that regard.

E17 was made for mainly portability in mind, even with that, they were able to make an awesome dac/amp.
However, the Magni and Modi are not very portable, they do not use batteries, so it makes them a at home couple. 'use at home" items (from all that i've auditioned) are always better than small portable stuff, unless those portable ones are extremely expensive then it might yield better performance.
You can't go wrong with either. If you're on the go, get the E17, mostly at home 80% of the time and can afford not listening to music when you're going out, get the Magni Modi combo.

From what i've seen and tried, all these realtek chips have distortion at loud volumes and seem to have a limit ceiling on them. (It also depends on what drivers you use with them). Those DAC's on the motherboards are probably 1-2 dollars each, perhaps even less at bulk prices. They are preamplified going to the amp will be double amped = distortion.
He may probably not hear it with cheap headphones (razer orca, tiamat, electra, carcharias | steelseries siberia | corsair vengeance 1500| etc) as they already have some noise on them as they are not entirely quite. Im just naming a few that i own by the way, i use to be a hardcore gamer.
I simply recommended him a better solution that was worth (E17 or Schiit's cheap combo).

The line out is on the motherboard (light green). Buy a 3.5mm to rca cable (i recommended shielded ones since you are connected it to a electronic heavy device [PC])
Do not use the line out on top of the NZXT, you will hear very noticable static.
How do i know? Picture tells a thousand words.
I own a $2500 rig. I'm pretty sure i know what im talking about.

Spending lots of money is not the same thing as "knowing" anything. In fact, you might just be the sucker of the year, as far as I am concerned.
 
Not trying to be rude or hateful, but you sir, are incorrect. Realtek chips don't test to have "distortion at high volumes" - your headphones / speakers do. There can be gain mismatches and so on that make you hit different "ceilings" or whatever you call it with different amps / speaker systems, but no, your experience is contradicted by fact.
 
Your assumption that low cost = low quality is also laughable. Realtek can sell a million chips for a buck and make more money than some botique supplier with an equivalent chip - and that is economies of scale, pure and simple. High quality and low costs are good things. AMP/DAC makers only WISH they had such a cost advantage or such a huge market to serve.
 
the Green jack is most ALWAYS the headphone / speaker out. It is typically low impedance and higher power, and most often NOT the line you would feed into an amp. It is there to power headphones or weak low end computer speakers. With a higher end realtek set, line-outs are assignable to different tasks, and you can have, effectively, the same high impedance (=lower distortion) 1V or so output that a typical audio device might have. But that would be a black/gray jack, NOT the green one. That is the amplified output. Even though you couldn't hear the difference, it probably does "distort" more. 
 
My experience with onboard audio, which includes cheap as dirt computers and over-priced high end junk tells me that, for the most part, distortion is NOT a problem with things properly connected and set up.

You just contradicted yourself by "not trying to be rude or hate" when all you've thrown at me were rude and hateful things like calling me sucker of the year.
I have never said low cost = low quality, which is why i recommended the Schiit combo because it's very high in value. But we're on a head-fi forum which people come here to learn and heighten themselves in the audio field.
What you said about realtek is true indeed, they have more supply and demands thus they can sell for much cheaper than what the competition can offer, but let's face it, when it comes to audio chips (motherboards in general), there is no great circuitry for the audio on there. Many PC Gamers know little to none about audio, so those motherboards most likely will not have a great dac chip anytime soon (or other variables to improved sound)
When i was talking about the distortion, i should of specifically said the green jack. My mistake. I should of clarified myself a little, not all motherboards come with black/gray ports, some only light green,blue,pink thus i was only left to talk about the only possible line out in that situation which would accommodate to extra noise. (I can hear it with hard to drive headphones at loud volumes, which stated before)
he said he would be using the HE-400, so i only recommended for what i saw to be a better outcome to drive the planar magnetics.
Like roller says, its a "disservice by running an onboard audio chip."

Depends what type of listener you are.
Do you like laid back sound?
If you're not one of those listeners who are so picky about so much detail in music, then the HD650 will be a better choice for you.
It will give you a better mixture of music & with its smooth signature, your ears can listen for hours. (con: not enough treble, can be a tad too smooth)
HD650 rolls off that upper treble (which i find important to really feel the power in the singers vocal ability)
If you like detailed music that is well separated and less mixed, go for the HE-400. The HE-500 can do better for $300, however, it's not as surprising to listen to as the HE-400. HE-400 does better for more bass filled songs.
So yes, i would say the HE-400 is significantly better than the HD-650. Resolution and quickness is just extraordinary once you put a orthodynamic headphone on, you'll know. It's a love it or hate it situation. You could even be one of those who ends up preferring the HD-650.Tim

So... after a good weekend with my new HE-400 i realized that with the Fiio E17 i need to lower the treble by -6 and up the bass to +4. 
 
Its not like it sounds "worse" if i dont, i just enjoy my gaming more this way.
 
Ill be trying them with my PC as soon as i can get it to Poland (I moved from Spain) with the X-fi Titanium, with optical cable as soon as i can, but im quite impressed by their performance in general.
 
The seller at my local shop told me to come in after a few weeks (when they will burn in), to test some aftermarket cables (ill probably want a short one :D).
 
The only part that is a bit bothering is that the headphones pick up distorsions very clearly. When i watch streams, if the streamers are using a regular microphone, its unwatchable. There is this one streamer who tends to have distorsion on his stream and also hits his microphone a lot for some reason, and id really like to kill him (he streams my favorite matches, but he is a terrible, terrible caster).
 
Granted these are NOT for stream watching, but its a bit bad.
 
On the weight, the first time i used them i had to take them off after 20 minutes. Now (3 days later) i can play 4 hours straight np. Funny enought, my neck hurts less now than when i didnt use them (they exersice my neck or somethin?).
 
 
I found out my general sweetspot is setting the Fiio E17 on gain 6 volume 25-40, treble -6, bass +4. (Does this mena im a Bass head?).
 
So far i played : Dragon Age Origins, Just Cause 2, Summoner 1, Tribes Ascend, Starcraft 1 and 2, Diablo 2, FEAR 1 (Persus Mandate), Crysis 1 and Stalker Clear Sky.
I was Positivly impressed by all except Summoner 1 (didnt know sound quality was that bad in this game... and i love the soundtrack) and FEAR 1 (got more scary..).
 
In general, everything sounds better. The extact words that are good to define this is "Separated" and "Detailed". I am capable to disterning movement in the mids of explosion sounds, so the feeling f realism is significanly improved.
 
The Pads are very good qualiy leather as far as i can tell, since i normally sweat a lot wiht my sennhesier HD 380, and with theres, its not been an issue yet. They do however "move" a bit when slightly pressed, so i got the feeling they might not last very long.
 
I will be changing them for Beyerdynamic pads later on (saw on this thread they do fit nicely).
 
On the bad side, they fatiguated me till now (with treble at 0), will comment more on after further testing.

Well, I will always love emphasized bass, but the HD650's bass was satisfying to me, and the mids really shocked me.
Yes though, the HE400's bass is pretty much perfect. I just wish it had a little more mids, and a little less upper range.
I do like it more than the HD650's slower, more reserved tone, but I wish there was a marriage between the two. Perhaps the HE500, but I sure as hell ain't going to put that weight on my head. The HE400's weight bothers my neck as is.
I miss the HD650 though, but there's a few headphones I'd like to hear before going back to the 650. Philips X1, K702/65. If neither of these satisfy me, I'll definitely go back to the HD650 as my 2nd full-sized.
The only thing that scares me about the X1 is the size... I feel I may have to do this...
Just waiting on it to be sold on Amazon (even if it's through a 3rd party). I'll buy them Asap.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/17/12 at 4:12am

It's all about conditioning. Once your neck can take it then it is a non-issue. I'd say HE500s are the sonic synthesis you are looking for.
 
For me, optimizing HE500's comfort was through 1) adding the extra headband cushion and 2) using HFM pleather earpads instead. The second point sounds a bit strange, but I found that the velours were too thick which exacerbated the weight of the cans through excessive clamping force, while the thinner pleather pads just sort of gently rest around my ears. Basically the end result is that I feel next to no pressure anywhere on my head, the only place being stressed is my neck/upper back but it's fairly minor as I'm getting used to the 500g.
 
Also to elaborate further on the pleathers + HE500, I actually found it to be a pleasant sonic change, unlike pleathers + HE400. HE500s have fairly forward upper mids and a "nice" treble with a gentle peak at 9kHz, and the pleathers are able to attenuate down the upper mids as well as the mid-treble peak slightly, which make their tonality a bit warmer and natural IMO. Before with velours, I wasn't able to really engage in a few vocal tracks (e.g. Eva Cassidy's Field of Gold), but that was remedied by this pad change.

I'm waiting for my replacement HE-4 to come home to make a shoot-out between the 3 (4s, 400s, 500s). I didn't remember the 4s to sound that heavy in the mids (as opposed to the 400s) and I also liked the more intimate presentation (congested sound-stage) it portrayed, but that was on my former setup (NFB-3.1 + m-stage) and with the older velour pads.
 
Technically, the HE-400 is better, no doubt, but that damn mids are quite holding me back as of now. I tried them on my dad's system (Cowon J3 + m-stage) and I was less bothered with the mids... Go figure...
 
Regarding the HE-500s + pleather: it definitely sounded off in the mids the first time I heard them. Switching to the velours had a great (positive) impact on the naturalness of the sound. I suspected the pleather to be like "crushed" by the clamping, which changed the damping a bit. I found the HE-400s' pleathers to be even more "flabby" than my 500s, which makes them even more prone to sounding off.

I know with myself at the meet, I didn't  have any source items or amps of my own - just packed the headphones this time.  I was able to take my own headphones and test out some of the various sources and amps that were present.  I found out that I was a bit down on my own headphones at the time,  But, when I returned home, plugged in my headphones to the typical gear that I use for the source, along with my music - and everythig was back to normal again.
 
I really think that a headphone meet is a great place to get to try out something that you might consider buying. But, I don't think that the end, or ultimate decision should really be made until you've had a chance to take the headphones home and listen to it in your environment that you are accustomed to.  During the meets, I think there is way too much stimulation going on with 25 different pair of headphones in the room. Plus, your mind is very active during a few of the hours trying to analyze various data on each of the headphones.  It's a good place to go at catch some perspective on various headphones, but I still would not base my purchase 100% soley on what I gained from a headphone meet.
 
Maybe, that's just me, but I've been in the game too long, and invested dearly on items that I've purchased, then later sold at a loss.  I tend to be careful now and not jump too quickly into an area that can still be a bit uncertain.

Hey Jerg, can you post the parabolic curve you apply to the HE-400 to tackle "tizziness" again? I can't find it.
 
Florence and the Machine "Lungs" contains a few tracks where I think this tizziness is on display, and I am playing with EQ to search for the offending frequencies. My understanding is that human voices, even singing, are generally somewhere between 125 Hz to about 3.5 Khz. Any higher and there is not necessarily a lot of content to voice going on, but their may be some "air". The HE-400s "roll off" between about 2kHz - 5 Khz, and then dramatic boost back to 9 Khz is probably not the key area. Florence has a lot of voice layering and some echo effects going on, along with instrumentals which I suspect make for a "hot" midrange.
 
Wondering the extent to which the HE-400s might just "reveal" the tizz versus produce it.

I, too, never experienced any reach change as a result of burn-in time with the HE-400s.  They essentially sound the same today as they did a few months back from HifiMAN.  Which puts me to my current project / task.  I truly am "content" with the HE-400s given their relative ease to drive - even though I can give them plenty of juice, and still resort to speaker taps, if necessary.  I do have the option of moving to an EQ, to tame the things a bit in the 7kHZ to 10kHZ range where sibalence can be noticed with the female vocals.  While I do use a Squeezebox to stream my FLAC and other files, the Squeezebox has a plug-in option using a software EQ.  I can go up to a 9-band offering where I would be able to then work a bit towards localizing the frequency needed for adjustment.  Yet, the Squeezebox plug-in option might limit me a bit as I believe it then applies the adjustment to all players.  I have three of these blasted things in my house.  Or, then we have "Plan B" - and, that is to incorporate an "old school" analog EQ into the mix, which is possible, since I do have Yamaha integrated 2-channel gear with tape loops.  I did locate an ADS EQ on the local Craigslist for $10.00.  The same model still runs $99.00 on eOverPay (I mean eBay.)  I might swing by and get that EQ on the way home and insert it into the mix and see what I can come up with.
 
Then, there is plan "C" which would be to go ahead and make the leap back to the HE-500s.  But, I'm a little burned out in the excitement of getting an item, burning it in, then the rest of the "blah, blah, blah" process. 
 
Barry, since you're local, just give me a shout if you want to take the HE-400s for a few days.  I think if you can get them in your environment, and away from the the noise and distractions that you may have faced during the meet on Saturday.
 
Edit: I realize in my post, that cris-crossed with MrMateoHead's post, reflects slightly different frequencies of focus.  I'll be sure to check later to see Jerg's response, as well as hopefully share some of my own experience based on my results.

Thanks for the file.
 
In a slightly older post, I link to an interesting cite where you can check out a human voice "radio style" broadcast that splits up frequencies really well.
 
I find that the 1 khz region is perhaps critical for sibilance, but also where voices actually start to become intelligible. It was definately around 4 khz - 10- kHz on up where the "sizzle" starts to show up - but at that point, you could not know what was being said or sung. Hence, it would seem that, at that point, while their may be some voice wandering into those frequencies,the female's voice is less important than the overlap with whatever instruments. Supposedly, you might boost those higher freqs for the sake of putting some "air" around her voice.
 
Its interesting because the tizz sounds almost like a slight distortion - either in the recording, or in the phones. To my ears, it is somewhat like static. I have played around with severely rolling off freqs from 4-20 kHz and dropping 1 kHz, but it doesn't make much difference other than dulling the listening experience. So I am chalking it up mainly to "revealing" phones and "hot" recording. Not all female vocals create this issue, though now that I am noticing it, I am noticing it everywhere! My HD595s even seem to reveal a similar issue. I guess each new pair of headphones trains my ears a little differently.

I'll bring this up again:
This bullsh*t burn in is:
- ALWAYS POSITIVE
-Adds bass if a headphone is bass light
-Subdues bass if a headphone has too much
-Brings out the midrange, if a headphone has mid recession
-Brings out the treble clarity if a headphone sounds veiled
-Lowers treble sparkle if a headphone is too bright
It adds/takes away where it's needed by the person claiming burn in occurs. I love how beneficial and perfect burn in is every time someone mentions of it happening.
I do believe changes in sound occur randomly. However, I absolutely call BULLSH*T on anyone who claims a certain hour mark, or after a certain period= better performance than earlier hours. For one, no two headphones are exactly the same. Two, even with Tyll's measurements, you can see the subtle changes being sporadic, and nothing 'settled'.
Again, burn in is more people adjusting to the sound of a headphone, as well as believing something would change so much for the better that their brain tricks them into thinking it's true.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/18/12 at 11:15am

I'm assuming that you're responding to my post with the link to the GR-Research site, right?  If that's the case, you have to realize that Danny Richie had nothing to gain in doing the testing and the post that he made.  This issue of burn-in vs. non burn-in has been going on for quite some time, which is why he went ahead, performed the tests, and posted the results.
 
As to burn-in negatively affecting the sound?  Well, I'm a victim of that.  This just happened last week with the AKG K167 Tiesto.  Out of the box, I loved the sound.  People talke about the sound improving over time.  Well, after a sufficient amount of time logged - even keeping the headphones plugged in while I wasn't at home, the sound just plain sucked at the end of the week.  The highs went to the level of becoming more piercing to the point of being unbearable.  The bass was still good on the headphones, but the highs just killed all of the fun.
 
I can understand your post regarding becoming a bit frustrated when people keep asking about burn-in.  Yet, don't take it personally.  We all have the option of ignoring posts.  If it affects you to the point of getting so upset, then consider an anger management class.

No disrespect, but if we were to apply your logic to Shoe break-in, it would read something like this: 
 
"I don't believe in shoe break-in."
"Say what! Why is that?" 
"Because people always report that shoe break-in increases foot comfort. If shoe break-in were real at least some people would report an increase in discomfort." 
 
There is most certainly a non-sequitur afoot here. 
 
Now, I know shoes are not drivers, so please don't read too much into this analogy. It's not meant to be taken too seriously.  
 
Imho, the problem of burn-in should be handled with a little less hostility. Really. We should scrupulously examine all the scientific data before accepting or dismissing headphone burn-in. But here's the rub: there's little to no credible evidence to support driver burn-in, but (and this is a big but) the same can be said for brain burn-in too, which is the only alternative theory. 
 
Also consider this little anecdote: a good friend of mine did not believe in driver burn-in, but a family member talked him into burning-in his new headphones anyway. My good friend listened to his new headphones for five minutes, and with a scowl made a few notes before stowing his cans in his desk to "gratuitously" burn them in for a week. And guess what? At the end of that week, he heard evidence of burn-in! With amazement, he looked at his notes, which read "anemic bass," "screechy treble," and stuff like that, and realized  that now he could not disagree more with his previous assessments.  Since he only tested his headphones for five minutes, and with the purpose of taking a few notes, we can safely eliminate the prospect of "brain burn-in." And since he was downright hostile to the concept of driver burn-in, we can eliminate "expectation bias" too. 
 
This is a true story btw. And my friend, well, I made him up: this was my experience. 
 
Of course, this proves absolutely nothing. We both know that. And you know what? I still do not accept driver burn-in as real, mostly because there's no science behind my own experience. So, I've adopted an agnostic attitude. I'm sure rigorous scientific testing will, in time, reveal the veracity or falsehood of this claim. Until then, I'm happy to say, "Calm down, folks. We just don't know the truth of it yet."

Please don't use analogies if they make little sense. 
 
Burn-in should be treated with hostility at times, because it's tossed around like a plague on head-fi, but so are amps, dacs.. cables *shivers*.... cable burn-in *kill me now*, tube rolling.  It's just one of the hyperboles among many other hyperboles that might make people lose their money.  I know, I fell victim to that.
 
As a side note, I got my schiit stack today.  Those guys only gave me one set of feet though, so I gotta head to home-depot sometime and get some more rubber feet.
I still don't have my objective combo and he-400 with me, so I'm only comparing the schiit stack to the imac's onboard sound using an EQ'd AD700, but it does seem as though the schiit stack has a lower midrange and bass warmth that the imac doesn't have.  I don't remember the objective combo having this.  I'll see soon enough though.

I just got HD650 from Amazon with O2+ODAC used from here.
 
Loving the pair considerably more than HD595 and udac2-hp, hehe.
 
But now I'm reading all this stuff about HE-400. I know it sounds silly for a sound related thread but my concerns with he-400 are:
 
1) is it easy to replace the velour pad? So easy if I return the He-400's it won't be an issue (assuming I order them)
 
2) got a great deal on hd650, if I return them and want them again, I will surely pay more. I guess I could audition he-400 and return the lesser pair
 
3) the look of hd650 is considerably classier and more refined imo. Velour ready to go, nice head band, some clamping but I'd imagine it eases up with time like my hd555 and hd595 I had.
 
4) long term hold up of these? They have 1-year warranty but have they been out for a year? I read some questionable quality on the He-4.
 
5) (a big one) that metal clamp looks terribly uncomfortable. I read OP had issues with comfort level with it resting on his head. Same thing that's scared me away from ever trying Grados, a friends were really bad even for 5 minutes of use.
 
Seems like Hifiman is a great DIY-expansion headphone. But i dunno, at least somewhat curious and tempted.

True, my analogy is rather absurd, but that's the point after all. I think it adequately parodies the non-sequitur i sensed lurking in Envy's post (But nevertheless, it's off the cuff and not well considered and possibly unfair to MadLustEnvy. So my apologies for sallying forth like Don Quixote yet again .)  Addressing your second point: I feel great sympathy for folks who have been duped by the audio voodoo perpetrators out there, but I try to put my personal feelings aside for the sake of ascertaining the veracity of such claims, especially claims as ubiquitous as the driver burn-in claim.  Though, I should stress this fine point once again: I'm at heart very skeptical of driver burn-in, despite my personal experiences. Anyway, I don't want to derail this thread, so henceforth, little Johnny (that's not my name, btw) is zipping his lips whenever this subject re-arises.

I was able to get the Inquz EQ plug in running in my Squeezebox a short bit ago.  I can set it up as anything from a 2-band to a 15-band EQ.  With my first run, I used the 15-band setting due to a few more bands available for a potential more precise level of adjustment on the frequencies.  Needless to say, I have Norah Jones playing at the moment, just as I did when I applied the settings.  New life has been applied to my HE-400s.  With that said, I wonder how many more adjustments would it take to the HE-500 signature?  Not that that is my mission at the moment, because of where I applied the adjustments, it really cleaned things up in an amazing way.
 
As to my "Plan B" I also picked up a 10-Band ADC EQ from the mid-1980s from a guy off of Craigslist.  I paid only $10.00 for that little beast.  Before setting up the software EQ, I did go ahead with the analog one by placing it in my chain between the Squeezebox and my amp.  It, too, did a great job  by essentially tweaking the adjustments on the same frequency bands.
 
Anywho, here is the graphic of where my "sweet spot" is for my HE-400 rig at the moment.

Similar to the other poster, I also:
 
* Did not like a particular pair of headphones
* Did not want them to get "better", I wanted to sell them to buy HiFiMan headphones
* Did want to write a review first
* Did want to let them burn-in for 100 hours, just so that my review "covered all bases by anyone's reckoning"
* Did put them in a closet hooked up to a music player for 100 hours, so it cannot be brain burn-in
* Reluctantly had to admit they sounded better in certain ways after the burn-in
 
So, two independent experiences demonstrating that it cannot be expectation bias or brain burn-in.   Doesn't mean we are correct, but those cannot be the explanations.
 
By the way, one of the two designers of the Schiit Magni amp told me yesterday that they recommend quote "50-100 hours" of burn-in time before evaluating the Magni.

I don't really think they're hollow, especially with vocal trance. If you give me a link to any songs in particular I can check them out and see how they work for it.
 
The recessed area on these headphones is recessed for a good reason - it's a pretty sensitive area to human hearing and noises in that range can sound harsh and piercing. If you listen to a sine sweep it will still sound like the volume is increasing in the recessed region.
 

Just because two independent experiences show that it might not be brain burn-in or expectation bias doesn't mean that it isn't in almost every other case. And I still believe it's more than likely a psychological thing in those two cases. You didn't want to experience it but your brain felt like being a dick and making you experience it anyways. Kinda like when someonte tells you not to think about a pink elephant.

Seriously. The brain is capable of so much. Infinitely more than some perceived notion that some time using an electronic device will automatically improve what you personally think is a deficiency.
You believe something is happening, so much that the brain will alter your perception of reality enough to convince yourself that it's true.
Again, I call bullsh*t on burn in because, well, I believe in the brain and your personal hopes of something being true making it true.
I've owned enough headphones with an unbiased opinion of burn in and noticed no change in sound (I burned in about half the headphones I owned). That is why I then became so anti-burn in. It's a joke that got so out of hand that those easily coerced by what's said on the interent have basically turned into a sort of audio related religious belief. I'm a skeptic and look for proof of everything I'm told, especially when it doesn't make sense. I don't automatically just assume it's true and expect it to be so.
I laugh when I see some people here bought a new headphone here, burn them in for like a day and say the bass got so much tighter and refined, etc. It's like LOLWHUT? I can't believe the nonsense here. AT ALL.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/19/12 at 6:56am

Arrrrrrrrrgh. Little Johnny can't help himself--he must respond. I agree with your every word, MLE. I just want folks to realize that "brain burn-in" is as much a theory as "driver burn-in." And though you have the winds of some sound ideas behind your sails, what sticks in my craw is the way many anti-burn-in folks so brutally assert their own counter-theories as fact. It's no good to pound a true believer's skull into the pavement, over and over again, while asserting your own admittedly more logical position, which, despite its logic, has no scientific backing, at the moment at least.
 
Your a skeptic, right? So am I. I'm with you all the way, buddy, but I'm not a skeptic for the sake of skepticism (I'm sure you're not either). And let's face it:  it's so easy to be skeptical of other peoples ideas (they are so clearly wrong after all), but it's so hard--hard as nails, I say--to turn that skepticism inward, toward your own ideas and beliefs. This is something I try to do: call it a philosophy. I scorch my own ideas regularly. I demand proof, especially of myself, and then after some serious introspection, and only then, will I go after other folks and their hair-brained beliefs. It's just the way I am, I suppose.
 
Again, though I agree with your every word, I have learned to look for evidence to buffer my counter-claims. But the evidence concerning this issue isn't out there at the moment (not that I've seen at least), which means we have no way to genuinely refute or falsify the burn-in claim. All this considered: Is it wrong of me to now ask, "Let's wait for the evidence before committing ourselves to a final verdict?" Apologies for dragging this out further. And nothing I've said here is said out of anger or hostility, but tone is sooo tricky in writing. 
Oh, here's one more crazy claim: The devil made me write this.

I agree with ya Chewy, mostly. The burden indeed belongs to the party making the claims. But when a counter-party makes a counter-claim, then they too should bear the burden of hard proof. As for how to test brain-burn-in: I have a wild idea! A MRI could be instrumental in evaluating brain activity in the auditory cortex, say, when stimulated by a familiar sound-signature and then by a novel or an unfamiliar sound-signature. This could be done several times over the course of many months ( to allow the unfamiliar signature time to become familiar). And if "brain burn-in" happens to be real, we might, just might, discover that in time the two divergent patterns of brain activity normalize or become more similar at least. I'm not sure this test has any chance of working, but, heck, who knows? It's a bold idea at least. Any bored, multi-millionaires out there want to give this a go?  Take one for the team? Put this issue to rest once and for all? Maybe I should contact MythBusters! By Golly, I think I'll do this!

Much more exciting and lively.
 
bass is considerably more.
 
not uncomfortable like i was expecting. actually less clamp than a new pair of 650's.
 
Plus i wanted to try planar, makes sound individual sound/instrument isolation and detail would be there.
 
650's are still excellent, but I think HE-400 are more my cup of tea. Has more of that WOW effect, to be sure. And not as heavy as I was fearing, though definitely heavier than HD650. Build is excellent too.
 
So good for EDM, jazz, even vocals sound pretty good despite me reading on here they can be harsh. Tried male and female.
 
I'm very impressed.
 
HD595 to HE-400 feels a lot more of a substantial leap than to HD650, but HD650 still knocks the socks off HD595.
 
 
And HE-400 looks A LOT better in person than photos, particularly flash blasted stock amazon ones.
 
That was my immediate reaction, a major concern for me. Even though I listen in solitude.
 
I didn't hear any HD650 veiling but when I compared it to HE-400, that was the best way I could describe it. The sound shooting out of the back with the headphones on the table is much richer than hd-650, if it's any indication.

HE-4 vs. HE-400
 
 
I just picked up a pair of the HE-4s from Justin at Headamp.   At the same time I’m borrowing a friends HE400.  They both got here about two days apart.  The 400s came first then the 4s.   So I got a chance to put good time on both.   I have some very interesting results.  The HE-4 is a very surprising headphone.  I really didn’t except this kind of performance.
 
For starters the HE-4 requires juice.   Not as much as the HE-5LE or HE-6 but more that the HE-400 and HE-500s for sure.
 
I used the a-100 speaker amp and the B22 with the HE-4.  I used the B22 with the HE-400s.  I tried both on the M&M stack.  The HE-4 sounded cold thin and shrill.  The HE-400 sounds like a blob of bass.  Both did ok at very low listening levels.  On the M&M stack the HE-400s did better. 
 
The HE-4 is a real airy headphone; some will call it bright when compared to the HE-400s.  I don’t think it’s a bright headphone in general just real airy.  Not thin at all, but not as full as the HE-400s.  Sense it seems like I’m immune to bright headphones I’ll call it bright but with lots of hesitation.  I say this because the treble is right, not etchy or spiky or peaky to my ears. It just fits right in line with the music.  The HE-400s treble can be spiky, etchy and peaky at times, that’s odd coming from a dark type of headphone.   It’s funny because sometimes the HE-400s will feel like a ice pick just went through my ears.  I don’t get that with the HE-4s but it’s still brighter.   OK so lets not call it bright lets call it airy.  Because that’s what it is airy.
 
I asked Jerg if we can get the FR graphs and plots for the HE-4.  It will be very interesting to see.
 
The soundstages on both are not anything to write home about.  We’re not talking about AKG or HD800 soundstage here so – they’re just OK.
 
The mids are not that great on the HE-4s, better on the HE-400s but not like mids on the HE-500 or the HD650. 
 
Where the HE-4s excel at is detail retrieval, speed, accuracy and instrument separation.  In this case it beats the 400s hands down.  To me the tonal balance is better than the 400s.   The HE-4 is not a bass head headphone at all.   It sure does not have HE-400s bass, but the bass is right in line with the tone and the presentation of the music.  If your track calls for bass punch or bass impact or bass attack it will give it to you in spade.  Where if fails to the HE-400s is bass extension and overall bass presence.  The HE-4 won’t extend down as low as the 400s.  However, I think the bass on the HE-4 is right according to the music it just don’t have that bass hump or bass dip whatever you want to call it.  In short, the bass is there.  For those of you who know.  It’s like the bass on the Paradox but more in all areas.   
 
The instrument separation is really good on the HE-4.  It sounds like each instrument has air and space to breathe.  It makes the HE-400 sound on the congested side.  I know the HE-400 is not congested but beside this airy, detailed, fast monster it does.
 
It sounds like the HE-400s are built around bass and the HE-4s are built around highs / treble.   Both excel at each one wonderfully.   Still the HE-500s – yes 500s have smoother highs and lush mids.  I’ll say the HE-400s are dark, the HE-500s are warm, the He-4 is bright airy.  Still the HE-4 wins in detail and clarity. 
 
The HE-400 sound more full and has more emotion. With bass.
 
The HE-4 will give you all the micro detail the HE-400s are missing. Without being clinical or shrill.
 
The HE-500 will give you those lush mids.

In terms of power, I cannot give an accurate value. I'm not even sure it has anything to do with the power output of my amps since there was not much difference between the m-stage (400mW) and the Fostex HP-A3 (100mW) in term of how loud they could drive the 500s and the resulting bass slam / dynamic they produced.
 
The thing is, switching from the HP-A3 to the Metrum Quad + SA-31 combo made a HUGE difference in term of soundstage and slam (+ improvement pretty much on all aspects). It sounds so much bigger and with a greater authority, yet the SA-31 - being a "diamond-difference" design - does not sound "tight" in the strict sense of the word.
 
I had a quick and unfair experience the other day: switch from Cowon S9 + m-stage + HE-400 (dad's setup) to my Quad + SA-31 + HE-500 => "Wow!". Man! When you switch from a lesser setup (which people might say is already (really) good) back to your main setup, the "WoW" factor remains intact! I almost shed tears! :D
 
Note: my dad's setup does not exhibit the mids "flaw" with the HE-400, though still dark, the male voices sound less heavy.

I'm not looking for another Hifiman, TBH. I love their HE-4 and HE-400, but I'm fed up with the design/build already. If I get rid of my HE-400, it's gonna be for the Philips Fidelio X1 (actually will be getting these next month). If they're as good as I think they'll be, and assuming they fit my large noggin, the HE-400s will be going up for sale. Ironically, the X1 seems to be almnost as heavy as the HE400, but the pads are deeper and WAY better FWIR. If the X1 doesn't work, I'm going with the K702/65 which is like almost half the weight of the HE-400. If THAT doesn't work, then it's back to the HD650s.
Something about the Hifiman's fit that is starting to bother me. The HE-4 is an exception. The combo if lightweight+old soft velours, make them amazing for comfort.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/20/12 at 6:01am .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

I'm all for this, assuming one of you gives me a share of the profits. 
But in all honesty, if I sell the HE-400s this time, that means I will also be looking into selling the SA-31 as well. I don't have the funds nor patience to have so much gear, and I wanna get into a minimalistic approach.
If the X1 ends up being a keeper, I won't need the ridiculous power of the SA-31. Well, not like I need it now.
Honestly, I just don't use my music setup much. I use my headphones mostly for gaming, and tv show/movies. The HE-400 isn't the best at neither of these things (more in practicality, not necessarily sound quality). That, and I can't really lay down with them. That's what the Yuin G1A is for.
Hell, I'd sell my Desktop for a 1920x1080 laptop, as well as selling my monitor as well. I really wanna trim down my setup. Would love to have a nice laptop with my Modi/magni stack, and that's all I want on my computer desk. Well, I'd go for a Bifrost/Asgard stack instead, but the Bifrost is $100 too much for me.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/20/12 at 7:00am

That's $200 out of my own money. Wasn't an easy decision. No way I can personally afford the LCD2. The X1 is different. I'll be using the Paypal Bill Me Later stuff ($630 max, $400 currently owed due to the SA-31 and ODAC purchase, which I'll be paying off with my 2 week vacation buy back money hopefully on my next check), which doesn't have a high enough limit to splurge on LCD2s. Also, I want mostly a gaming, TV/movie can. The LCD2 isn't known to be good for that, in terms of soundstage and positioning.
Believe it or not, I only make $9.25 an hour at the moment. Riding on the HE-400 sale to soften the purchase of the X1. Assuming I do sell the HE-400, which may not even happen. I'm still waiting on it to come back to me. Head-Direct is taking their sweet time.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/20/12 at 7:21am

So I walked into this Sony store today... they were selling "Sony X headphones" and since I'm into audio and enjoy trying new things, I decided to go in and see what these are, maybe they aren't that bad?
 
Well the guys selling these things were so arrogant... I went into just to try them out and see how they were (Its a store dedicated to this one headphone) and one of them asked me what I'm wearing, I told him, and they told me it can't possibly sound as good as Sony X. They asked me how much it was, I said $400 and they laughed at me, tried them on and claimed the Sony X are no comparison better.
 
Now in a way I expected it, since I was just with my Sansa Zip and no other gear. And to a certain extend I could see how judging from the 5 seconds they gave em, they could claim it was better in certain areas, but they wouldn't listen to logical at all. They didn't know what an AMP/DAC/Sound Card was and when I tried to explain how heaphones work and some need to be driven, etc they calimed it was false info.  They didn't know any terms (High's/Mid's/Low's) and all they kept repeating was "Your headphones have no Bass, They suck!"
 
*Sigh* I left the store cause I can't argue with those people, but now I NEED to buy a good portable DAC/AMP since I never want a situation like that to happen again ^_^ At home the HE-400's have amazing Bass and the sound quality destroys those Sony X's, now I just need to find something that can try and provide the same on the go.
 
Sooo... Point of this post, what's a good portable AMP/DAC combo for the HE-400's + Sansa Zip?
 
In the $100 range preferably... After I get it I'm going back there ^_^

I bought a brand new, 2012 Lamborgini this year.
 
As is standard practice, however, I paid a man to drive it a minimum of 100,000 miles at varying speeds in order to "burn-in" its sophisticated parts. Admittedly, when I first drove it, I found the ride a bit harsh, sightlines where restricted, and it wasn't really that fast compared to my Ferrari. It also felt like the seats smelled faintly of boot polish, and it seemed to use a lot of gas. I was thinking about trading it in for a used Audi S8 (which has a way smoother ride, superior ambiance, and room for even MORE people!). 
 
Well, now that I got the car back, I can't believe how AWESOME it is! It rides like a limo, seems to merge onto highway traffic effortlessly, and I swear I'm getting about 30 Mpg (though I don't bother to actually check). Best of all, the car has WAY more personality of its own which totally alters the driving experiance. There are knicks, scratches, and chipped paint on the nose that just scream "used" to the world, and I had no idea the base coat was gray. I think the slight fender rust has actually improved aerodynamics, which you will notice cause the car to lift off the ground at 200+ mph. I love the mushy gear engagement (the transmission is less grabby than before), bald tires, and distant belt noise has entered into the exquisite driving "experience". I could go on and on. Just buy it! 
 
(Sorry all I had to give my take on burn-in).  I believe in change/wear, I just don't believe its what you want . . .

A little off topic. We're getting ready to head out for the holiday in a few days. So I'm sitting here thinking about what if any audio gear I'd like to throw in my tote bag. My clip zip is coming as will my trusty earbuds. But what about any full sized hp's? The only one that I like to take with me is the sturdy maddogs, but they are out for recabling. So I resigned myself for the zip plus some earbuds. 
 
Then I see sitting in my daughters room, my old pair of panasonic htf600's. She's had them for better than six months and I had actually completely forgotten about them. So I grabbed them and my zip and popped them in for a quick listen...mostly out of curiosity. I must say that the htf600 is likely the best $30 you can spend in this hobby. They are a touch warm and a touch dark, but just ever so slightly. Man, the bass hits good on those. Not flabby cheap sounding bass either. Definitely layered bass. The mids are a bit weak, but come on...it's $30!! 
 
Now I have a full sized hp that I can toss in my bag and travel with in case I have any head-time over the holiday.  
 
Speaking of...Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone!!

You sound bitter. Do you also realize that modern engines are also banging off their redline before they ever leave the factory? Do you think anyone actually follows the manual-recommended break in procedure? Do you think that modern engineers are incapable of designing autos with modern electronics and materials that won't self-destruct when forced to burn corn-alcohol, low octane gas, water-laced gas, or that get floored when temperatures are -10 F and the engine is cold? Do you think billion dollar auto companies don't design cars as if people will frequently fail to "break them in correctly"? Have you seen the commercial of a Toyota Tundra being misused as a tow truck for a NASA space shuttle? Do you understand the concept of human/manufacturing hypocrisy?
 
I can play this game too.
 
The fact is, I acknowledged wear and tear. My opinion was that it is not "desirable" as slaves to the burn-in concept seem to think. It spells death of a machine, not "machine improvement". Wearing out a speaker diaphragm is just that - wearing it out. It is even more dubious to assume that after hours of electrons flowing through a solid state device, it will be magically transformed into a better performing device.
Also, I was being facetious in that post, so don't take it personally. If you could reed gud, youde have got that. Thx.

If you are being facetious, then you are mocking the idea that burn-in is imaginary ?
 
The point here is that there is an emotional fad lately that says - subconsciously, not consciously:
 

 
It's interesting that this fad coincides with a new generation who have grown up listening to worse and worse sound quality in the form of MP3s on iPods and ear buds, and who have become entirely disconnected from any reference point of sound quality in the form of live acoustic music.   At the same time, media like CNN and the New York Times have strongly encouraged people in general to express opinions on anything and everything, rather than the previous standard of only commenting on something within one's expertise.
 
The result is that threads like these are increasingly cluttered by people expressing opinions on things that they know absolutely nothing about, and doubling down by trying to support opinions when they are wrong.

Thank you.  Such truth you speak.  I grew up initially listening to the King Biscuit Flower Hour during the late-1970s using an AM/FM clock radio in my bedroom.  Fortunately, the concerts were played on the FM section on Sunday evenings.  From there, I progressed to building my own speakers to pair with new (now vintage) receivers from Radio Shack.  This then really ballooned in the mid-1980s, while in the military, I had a sound system in my room that ran about $2,000, with all discounts applied by buying it on a military base.  This then led me into many years of building more speakers, subwoofers, then finally buying great speakers and subs as well as getting into headphones.  Now, I sit at the age of 49 and feel fortunate for the experience I have had.  The education that I have received in audio through my own research has been priceless.  But, I have a real appreciation for a lot of music from various genres.  I can't have music playing on a radio just as background music as that doesn't satisfy me.  I'd rather wait until I can hear my music in a proper manner that will allow me to be more taken into the music and the moment.  I can attributed hundreds of events in my life and the best way I can remember them is by the musical link at the time.  Unfortunately, I have a not so good attribute with one particular musical event, as my own father passed away the day after John Bonham (Led Zeppelin drummer) back in 1980.  However, it all has been a great journey.  Truly, a great one.
 
Though I do joke a bit here and there in the forum here, I do have a serious side towards the music I listen to and how I listen to it. After all of the great concerts I've attended and audio I've listened to, a low bit-rate MP3 is something that I can't warm up to.

What are some of your guys' favorite tracks to play on these?
 
Electronic is blowing my mind so much with instrument isolation and energy. There is a bit of sibilance on poorly recorded female vocals but it's really not that harsh like I was expecting, but if it's recorded well, even the highest vocals SHINE on my set.
 
And most if not all male vocals are greeeat.
 
They are very revealing too! I keep thinking one side is slightly louder than the other, but I flip them and change channels, and I don't hear it. Then I read threads of people thinking the same thing (except not with HE-400s, HD650's ironically enough), and then I thought left side had slight rattle but it's just artifacts in the mastering or recording that I can pick up since they get isolated well too. Confirmed the same distortion with my Sennheiser PX90 and PX100's.
 
And easily driven! My iPhone 5 can play them at ample volume, except detail and clarity kicks back a notch of course relative to O2+ODAC.
 
My OCD needs to end! I've read too much on here about QC issues, and I gotta stop trying to look for issues. Because as far as I can tell, this set is great. It's also either r2 or 3.5 or whatever you want to call it. Not first and not the sandy yellow third :)
 
Just got a refund on my HD650's too from Amazon. Glad they didn't charge restocking (as I expected them to not).
 
I think they are more comfortable as well, despite my initial worries.
 
 
Anything by AIR is awesome, but I like Cherry Blossom Girl. Planar is much quicker than dynamic.
 
I need to keep my eye on the volume knob. 12 oclock is more than loud enough for most things. I've gone to 2-3 oclock, but over time that's just gonna murder my already probably slightly deteriorated hearing from shows when I was younger

update on a previous firstimpression on the he-400.
 
I have these for about 2 weeks now. The burn in is already obvious. The treble is not that fatiguating as before. I have been listening to about 3 hours of songs from "the cramberries" and apart from old memoeries, i "felt" the music. Also i have been using these outdoors for travel, and even if they look like you are an ET and they leak quite a lot, i simply cant go back to my senns HD 380 Pro.
 
Now i only need a shorter cable, but will wait for full burn in before i get it.
 
The weight is still a bit fatiguating, but id say i got used to it.
 
Next step in my opinion is to test them for someone who has not used good headphones before to see if they realize the improvement so dramaticly or if its a matter of "ear" practice.

I have to stop reading this thread and the other HE-400 leisurely.
 
I'm getting SO ocd its almost preventing me from enjoying my purchase.
 
I didn't have this much stress with HD-650 reading on headfi in terms of individual issues, but I felt I was playing it absurdly loud to hear all the details. On HE-400, it's more fun and I can hear it better and its isolated instruments rock.
 
One side being louder than the other, turned out to not necessarily be verifiable in a blind test and switching sides with earphones, haha.
 
Then the crackle thing, of which it's just mastering/recording flaws that HE-400 is very perceptive to, that I confirm in later pairs (but isn't as drawn out, because HE-400 isolates it like its an individual sample or instrument haha).
 
Then maybe one channel will go out? I really hope not, knock on wood. haha. 1-year warranty too since I bought through a local authorized reseller on Hifiman's reseller list.
 
Then the multiple revisions, of which from looking at the ear side, it's clear so either latest or version2 but given that the reseller said he's a new hifiman dealer, I'd assume it's revision 4 (or 3.5, or 2 being brought back out).
 
These cans sound fantastic. They won me over in an a/b for 2 hours between these and the HD-650 I already had and got a great deal on but ended up returning.
 
I need to chill and enjoy these suckers :D
 
Plantar is definitely another animal.
 
Coming from HD595 and UDAC2 to H650 through udac2 til O2+ODAC came to a/bing those with HE-400, getting He-400.
 
And I definitely have velour pads. I am a velour diehard.
 
And whoever recommended listening to The Postal Service album on these, Give Up, kudos!
 
Even with its warm, vinyl-y mastering it sounds sooooo good.
 
 
 
ONE LAST OCD question, and I don't think it's just the left side (though I think I have heard it more) when I was trying to hear if one side was louder than the other, occasionnally between shifting sides (left to right or vice versa) I'd hear like a quick static or distortion sometimes between going back and forth, same thing when I pause music I hear it. But i'm sure I've heard it even with phone in another room, so maybe not.
 
is this inherent to planar/he-400?
 
maybe some weird noise being given off by my o2 amp hooked up directly to the wall? maybe my phone being near my o2? I've definitely heard interference before if my iPhone is too close, like a pop noise that's continuous.
 
I didn't notice this with HD-650, but I wasn't obsessively checking for flaws like I've read about on this thread. Like listening to headphones and if they make any noise immediately after I pause.
 
is this something to be worried about? :( i really really really hope not.

Take it from an expert source then, Merriam and Webster: Facetious: joking or jesting often inappropriately
 
I was expressing an opinion and enjoying myself at the same time, is that OK in a complicated world? Sound and Sound equipment are not = Complex Automobiles. Hence inappropriateness. Yet, it was funny (to me and others I would hope).
 
Those that took offense are entitled to their opinions, facts, and emotions. If anything is clear to me, it is that "pure science" and "pure marketing" (of ideas and of course products), is an increasingly conflated or distorted practice which makes faith, even in fact, extremely difficult. Facts are easy to manipulate at times to serve ideas, and ideas are far more elegant constructions that are also difficult to deconstruct as some facts will support them. There is always the crisis of making a choice. I suspect it has something to do with people resisting the obvious problem that rational thought and facts will only ever get us so far. More importantly, I think that there will always be more problems in observance than there will be facts to describe or to solve them. Given my experience of head-fi, I remain skeptical of the value of burn-in. Moving on . . . ?
 
Your comments RE: people's ability to "avoid" reality and fact by hating on wealthier headfiers or those with listening "skills" is curiously divisive considering that there are many means of measuring performance of equipment as well as ears in an objective way. I noticed your self-professed bias for "live acoustic music" as the "only reference" of value in terms of evaluating the performance of, what . . . headphones? I hope you mean live acoustic music such as a symphony hall, and not a concert that includes mixers, amplifiers, and bright lights. There is no comparison really, and even an honest attempt to "match" the performance will fail, unless the criteria is carefully determined, isolated, and analyzed. The reductionism implicit in this process almost gaurantees that we will all be left impressed, but "wanting" for more - without doing the rational thing, like going to an actual acoustic performance.
 
Suddenly, the value of the crappy iPod is apparent. More music reaching more people, when they want it, how loud they want it, etc. Rather than attempt to coerce preference (by demanding they select only that which sounds closest to "real life"), we attempt to let the individual decide. As you note, perhaps the "real" benchmark should be the millions of cheap Mp3s, iPods, and skull candy buds. If that is what "the people" and by extension "the market" deem to be the reference standard for modern music, well, your preference for concert starts to seem quite particular. Yet you are critical of those people that not only "don't get it", but buy crap off the shelf rather than pouring in their learning and resource. What goes around comes around. I don't come here to debate the "facts" or to get "the facts". Forums are nothing but imperfect mediums for bringing persons with similar interests together. I consider it a social platform first, and a "fact" platform last.
 
But the fact is, I need to get back on a discussion of the HE-400s! I am glad I caught your attention K, but I did not start the "burn-in" digression.

Actually, the bottleneck is the E7, not the E9. The E9 is a great amp. The E7 is pretty bad DAC. Even the Fiio D3 is better. People need to realize this. Also, the E9 wouldn't even affect the HE400 with it's output impedance, as planars are basically immune to that, unlike dynamic headphones.
Your opinion is quite the opposite of what most people here on Head-fi have experienced, including myself. The E9 competed quite well with other SS amps I've used, including my SA-31. The E7...didn't. The E is better than an onboard soundcard, but other than that, it's pretty entry level.
Thought the E9K sounded great with the HE-400 too. Not as refined as the SA-31, but for $109, it sounded VERY damn good. About as good as the Magni does.
Again, I say to switch out the E7 for a better DAC. There is more to squeeze out of the E9.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/25/12 at 6:34am

I'll probably give HiFiMan a call tomorrow. The grills are easy to take off right?
 
As for the sound, still adjusting to the signature after spending a lot of time with the AD700 recently and trying a little of everything from jazz, piano, rock, and pop. Right off the bat I would say they are very pleasant to listen to (and I mean that in the best way possible). I'm also finding them VERY comfortable. My AD700 had gotten very uncomfortable. Itchy, slid around around my head, too much material on my jaw, ears touched the diaphragms, etc. and I almost don't even feel the 400 on my head right now (I stretched out the headband a little). Trying the leather pads now and may switch on the velours tonight.
 
Currently running them out of the old Meier Headfive.

This looks like the right thread to post in!  I would consider myself a beginner audiophile, but I've always had great appreciation of audio-quality and all aspects of music in general.
 
Yesterday night I purchased the HE-400's, and I'm extremely excited!  A little over two years ago I purchased a pair of Audio-Technica M50's for monitoring with my recording setup, and I was very impressed and satisfied with them.  I eventually ended up using them quite frequently as a portable headphone, and as my "stay at home, turn the lights out, and listen to high-quality recordings alone with my eyes closed" headphones.  The M50's were my first "high-quality" headphone, and a couple weeks ago they were stolen. 
 
I was originally looking to only replace the M50's, and while doing research for some of the other competitors, I stumbled upon this website.  All of a sudden I was exposed to the world of hi-fi headphones, and I have honestly done hours upon hours of research each day.  Near the beginning of my research period, after discovering there were many better options than the M50's, I was thinking about purchasing Sennheiser HD-598's.  As my research progressed, I veered away from those, and began looking at the Beyerdynamic DT-770's, 880's, and 990's, respectively.  After even MORE research, I discovered the Hifiman HE-400's.  I was intrigued, but thrown off by the $400 price tag.  If you couldn't guess from my writing so far, I was inclined to research the hell out of them.  I saw nothing but good things... (quality relative to price, etc...)
 
I'm super, super excited for them to come in.  I purchased a portable amp as well, the fiio e17.
 
I have a couple of questions for you all:
 
- How much of an upgrade are these from my previous listening experience with the M50's? (Remember that I have never used an amp before, and I'm going to be using one with the HE-400's)
- Is the fiio e17 a quality amplifier by itself, and when paired with the HE-400?
- Should audio quality and fidelity be great when running [ iPhone (Spotify) > e17 > HE-400 ] or [ Laptop (Spotify) > e17 > HE-400 ] ?
I have some more questions about my setup and Spotify, but I will ask those separately, or in another more appropriate thread.
 
Thanks!  Can't wait!
*You might be confused why I have such simple questions when I wrote I have done such prolific research.  The answer is simple:  I have done research, but it is very comforting to hear answers from previous owners geared specifically towards my potential setup.  A more personal response, if you will.*

Agreed. I love the M50s (still one of my very fave closed cans), but the HE-400 is two leagues above the M50s. You should notice the difference quite clearly. Like the M50s, the HE-400 sounds great off practically anything. Unlike the M50s, the HE-400 does scale up a little with some amping. Everything benefits from a good, clean source. The E17 is a great source, and a good amp. I personally think the HE-400's treble is slighty harsh off the E17, but that's what the E17's treble controls are for. Bass +2 and Treble -4 is what I liked with the HE-400.
In other news, I've had the HE-400 back for a few days after sending it to Head-Direct, but haven't had almost any time testing it, since I've been busy reviewing the SLYR, A40, and A50 headsets, as well as just getting my Yuin G1As (which I've been using pretty much exclusively this whole week).
Decided to give the HE-400 some head time today, and it reminds me why I bought them again in the first place. I just absolutely adore their sound. They really are something special.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/27/12 at 4:51am

For me, I'll live with a slightly smaller sound stage in the HE-400s.  While it might be minimized compared to other cans such as the DT-990s, I still think it is far above what some of the other offerings I've experienced in the past.  I could spend $200+ to opt for another headphone solution to use with the HE-400.  But, to me, my bigger priority at the moment is getting a better head band cushion built for mine.  I do know that members have posted various methods of improvements for theirs with the Sennheiser pads, etc. on the head band.  However, I'm a kind of guy that likes my headphones to look stock, or as the manufacturer would have intended.  So, my work will focus on using the same materials for a better head band.  I have all the supplies and materials, which will allow me to proceed with the task during this upcoming extended weekend.  I'll get some pictures posted of the completed work.

No comfort issues here :) Compared to my Pro 900, the HE-6 comfort is leaps ahead. They dont even feel all that much heavier :) Sure they are heavier but my head seems to handle that without problems. Other than that they may put excessive pressure o your jaw, but it only takes a little adjusting to lessen it. The velour earpads are comfortable enough and certainly not as itchy/uncomfortable as the Ultrasone ones, which are softer but I suspect it has also to do with less breathing room for my ears.
Also, I have relatively big ears and the bigger earcups of the Hifiman  do not cause any contact with my ears, working as two pillows for my ears, compared with the Ultrasone, which is still big but apparently not enough for my ears.
Lastly,the headband padding is fine enough and apparently they fit perfectly on my head and makes proper contact with the whole head :D
 
I guess I am one of the few who finds the stock combo good/comfortable enough :D

Actually, my real complaint isn't a complaint at all.  Nor, is it a comfort issue with the headphone itself.  The problem is that I suffer from an issue due to small brain mass.  This issue has resulted in me having a smaller head.  Due to this issue, when I have the HifiMAN headphones on my head with the sides pushed all the way up, the ear pad still rests on the top of my ear.  I need to add about 1/2" of padding to the band itself, so the ear cup placement will be accurate for my ability to hear and enjoy the headphones properly.
 
While I do suffer from a smaller brain mass, the issue from the HifiMAN headphone fit is one issue.  I also can't walk and chew gum at the same time.  That is another big limitation.  However, each morning, I am very fortunate that I can tie my own shoe laces so I don't trip on them when I walk.

I received my replacement pair of HE-4 this morning (one earcup detached itself from the head-band, 2 months after the end of warranty...).
 
Before any comparison with the HE-400 (and HE-500), I wanted to share a pic of the babies:
 

 
The lighting  does not do them justice but you can notice they are different than what you see on the web (and the HE-4 they replace) for 3 reasons:
- The half-rings are now grey (like the 500s) instead of black (like the 600s)
- The cups are not black (like the 600s, again) but rather dark blue, like no other Hifiman headphones. It is close to black (not on the picture) but one can see a hint of blue. As if they repainted the HE-400 blue cups with black laquer. The result is gorgeous!
- The drivers now have a plastic protection in the inner side. My former HE-4 did not have anything, I could touch the planar driver through the pad's "cloth".
 
On my screen, the cups color look pretty much like the HE-400 but they are much darker in reality (very close to black).
 
Seems like Hifiman made some adjustment to the HE-4 too... Let's hope it sounds good ^^.
 
Bad note however but I anticipated that: they didn't ship it with the pleather I had on my broken 4's (which I really like, confort-wise, and sounded better than the old-styled velours).

I'd opt for the Sennheiser HD-650 if I had to make the choice.  While the Mad Dogs are good, they are a modified Fostex headphone.  Sennheiser, on the other hand, has a long-time standing in the headphone world, and their products do an excellent job of retaining their value.  Today, the variants of the Fostex heapdhones are doing pretty well with regards to maintaining their value.  Tomorrow?  Who knows.  Plus, with the bass on the Fostex variants, the bass is there.  But, the bass isn't as layered and detailed as I would like them to be.  Again, just my person .02 input based upon experience.
 
Also, as a response on the Audio-GD gear, I've noticed that something seemed "odd" with the sound, and I've owned two of their pieces.  Through some digging, I've been able to determine that they tend to roll off their low and high frequencies a bit on their amps and amp/DAC combos.  I've read this from others, too, who have made the same comment.  In fact, they've gone as far to question how Audio-GD does their testing of their gear - which music, etc., because the music that others typically listen to doesn't fare as well with the Audio-GD.  Again, that's just based on my experience, too.  Others might feel different.

Every headphone has an imbalance here or there, usually like 2 at different levels. And no, its not in my head. Sinegen gives you a tone, and you can adjust a slider to lower or raise the frequency. Almost all the headphones I have tested have an imbalance near the upper range of treble, so its not an issue. This HE400 has imbalances starting in the mids and works its way up to different ranges.
If the headphone is fine, the tone is directly in the center. Once you adjust the slider slowly, you can hear the tone hover to the left or the right. In the case of this HE400 it literally moves to the left and right with its imbalances.
Just because you cant hear it, doesn't mean it's not there. I have tested enough headphones to know whether the imbalance is there or not.
I wear the headphone backwards, swap cables, use different amp/dacs, and the imbalances remain on a particular driver. 
  
=============================================
Topic: 8999896 in thread 604583
=============================================


How would you describe the imbalance with your particular pair though? Even with my very (relatively) balanced HE500s, I still find some segments of the FR where the balance shifts to one side or the other. If the imbalance only covers relatively small segments in the Sinegen freq range then it shouldn't matter in any practical sense. It is only when very broad (e.g. 50-200 Hz, or 2kHz - 5kHz) sections of the freq range are affected and always toward the same side that it will become an issue.
 
Edit: also another effect that I recently started noticing is that the hearing sensitivity of our ears are far from balanced. For instance if I detect an obvious imbalance at 5.5kHz on my HE500, and I just turn the headphone over so the L channel is worn on my right ear etc, the imbalance stays at the same side, meaning it's my hearing at that frequency that is imbalanced, not the driver. Kinda weird.

I mean just because HE can't hear my pair with the imbalance, doesn't make it any less true.
This isn't a self diagnosis. Sinegen clearly points out the imbalances. It doesn't take a rocket scientist or someone with golden ears to spot the problematic areas.
I'm sure if the skeptics actually downloaded sinegen, they'd be shocked at how their headphones aren't perfectly matched. Not one single headphone I have tested has NOT had any imbalance somewhere along the frequencies. Some are just bettet than others at making the imbalances less obvious, or have less in quantity.
You're not testing music. You're literally testing a constant tone that changes when you lower/raise the frequencies. Ideally, the tone stays right in the middle of your head. As you very slowly adjust the frequency slider, you will eventually come to a point where the tone will shift to one side of your head. That is an imbalance. Whether its the headphone, your ears, or your equipment is what you have to figure out.
This isnt placebo, or your brain playing tricks. Its a clear and obvious change in where the sound is. Literally like looking at a bar or circle that moves to the right or left.Edited by Mad Lust Envy - 12/28/12 at 11:28pm

I've just recently purchased the HiFiMan HE-400 after much time looking for a suitable headphone, this is my first step into the head-fi arena. Then spent a considerable amount of time getting through 3,849 posts and with so many posts - figured this model must be very popular by the head-fi community. Note to self, when doing research for a product on head-fi, look for a thread that has lots of posts as it indicates some popularity with the community.
 
I've got the HE-400 being driven by an unknown Chinese made DAC/amp called the HA-INFO DA1. Before buying this, I should have looked into the FiiO E17 or JDS Labs O2 amp + Objective DAC. The only consolation is that the HA-INFO DA1 uses the same DAC as the E17, the Wolfson chip does make the music sound more pleasant.
 
There's a lot of useful information in this thread for newbies such as myself. The inexpensive way to improve sound quality seems to be getting the velours and the mod to the standard grill. Will have to try these out after enjoying some listening time with the current set-up.

Yeah I wont even bother testing with that.  If I can't detect imbalance issues during practical usage, then I don't know why I'd even begin to worry myself over such things as that.
 
For what it's worth, I've followed the HE-400 threads closely since they first came out.  Other than the very first rev of the he-400 where one driver would go out or have problems over time, I don't remember anybody else reporting imbalance issues on their pair.
 
I certainly don't want reports such as that to sway anybody against a purchase, because it obviously drove enough of a stir to get even Justin of Headamp to question it a little.
 
All FR measurements of HE-400 I've seen have shown have shown the response of both drivers to be relatively even with each other, I don't see any legitimate cause for concern here like the cases we had with the DT1350, Pro900 etc.

I've finished my head band modification.  In order to keep the stock appearance, I used a soft leather cow hide to make the covering for the new leather head band. It is stuffed with 1/4" cotton batting - 4 layers on the top of the headband, and 5 layers on the head side of the head band.  The objective was to keep the appearance as close to stock as possible.  Also, I didn't want to destroy the original head band, in the event that I had to return to that offering.  The covering that I made can be removed in under two minutes, if needed.  All one needs to do is to take a razor blade and snip through the threads on one side of the band, then it can be removed from the headphones.
 
Sorry about the slight blur / focus issue on the pictures.  I'll see if I can't get some better daylight pictures in an hour or so when the sun fully comes up.

Quoted from way back, I'm clearly too slow to keep up with the thread. I had the DT990 600 Ohm, I'm sure they are not that different. But the biggest factors leading me to sell the HE-400 were the following:
 
I felt the soundstage was slightly larger (something I enjoyed)
I enjoyed the treble more, it was more "forgiving" than the HE-400 that simply made certain electro tracks of mine too bright.
And most importantly, comfort! I could wear the DT990 for hours and forget they were on my head, while the HE-400 was a bit too heavy for me, the velour pads weren't as comfortable as the DT990s and my ears would hit the pads and create some soreness after 15-20 minutes causing me to re-adjust the headphone ever so often.
 
All this may change if I ever get my hands on the DT990 again, I'll quickly realize everything that the HE-400 does better. Only time will tell.

Yes, it really is as soft and comfortable as it looks in the picture.  I've been wanting to do this project for a long time.  Really, a long time, but just had some free time to perform the modification.

 
You already know my address.    Stalker!      Actually, see my response to Darryl below.  

 
This is my hobby.  I don't ever want to make money off of headphones.  If it do, I would be saddened as I'd have a business and not a hobby.    I'm never opposed to doing a few of these jobs for a few of the buds.  The only issue, though, is that the headphones have to be sent to me.  I don't mean that is a selfish way, either.  The project requires the current head-band and the HifiMAN bands from the factory are placed in such a way that the band can't be removed without some harm being done.  Plus, when I install it over the existing band, it is a simple reversible mod, if one doesn't like it.  The only cost is for two shipping trips for the headphones.  I just would not want to over-commit and under=deliver as I could see that happening.  So, if I were to do two pair, I'd make two people happy and I'd be happy for doing it.
 
The original problem that I faced with the factory HifiMAN band, is that the headphones sat too low on my ears.  This meant about a 1/8th to 1/4" air gap at the bottom of the cups.  Adding the padding didn't just make the portion that rests on the head much more comfortable, but it made the pads fit 100% better in my situation.
 
A few more daylight pictures, that have a bit better focus.

I commented on this before. Its funny that other people play around like I do.
 
I do not think this is a "problem", or a clear sign that improvements could be made further.
 
The same phenomenon occurs in Car Audio. Sometimes, the bass sounds a lot better with windows or doors open vs. keeping them closed. Certainly it can improve by dropping the seat backs down. At SPL competitions, I have seen people measure better with the door open vs. closed. I don't really get it. But since sound travels in waves, picture filling your car with water, and then splashing it as hard as you can. The waves flow out, but at some point, bounce off car surfaces and are either absorbed or reflected. I am sure it looks really chaotic. You open the door however, and all the water now has a path to flow out of the car.
 
For the HE-400 I can think of only 2 things. First, someone should sacrifice some pads. Just cut a small chunk of the pad out, and leave the rest on. Deliberately break the "seal" in other words, and see what happens. The second thing is possibly the change introduced by angling the pads more naturally with the curve of your ear. My older Sennhesisers do this, and I assume it is a better way of designing ear phones.

BTW, what's with the uber-high resale prices on the HE-400 in the F/S forum?  I'm posting here, because I don't want to thread crap in a person's thread about their pricing.  However, $375 - $380 for a used pair is really nuts. I do realize shipping is included in those prices, but still ... The warranty doesn't transfer to a 2nd owner, so if the 2nd owner has troubles, then they will be out $75.00 - $85.00 to HifiMAN in order to get the headphones replaced.  I say just spend the $20.00 extra and get a new pair and have the confidence of a warranty behind you for a year.  Or, check out the returned HE-400s from headphone.com where they sell for about $339.00 and you still get the warranty.
 

 
i'm not selling my HE-400s.  Never.  However, if I were to ever sell them, I would say that $350.00 would be a more realistic price, with both types of pads included, as well as shipping costs.
 
OK, that's the last beef I'll have in 2012.  That is, unless something gets under my crawl tomorrow, which is December 31st, 2012.

The M&M, though I don't own the combo, is likely going to sound quite a bit better than your computer. Note, not "night and day" different, but certainly should make a strong impression on you. If your current on-board sound solution is utter crap, than you can expect a big difference. Its just hard to guess if you will like the change or not, since I find a lot of equipment grows on me more than it impresses me on first listen.
 
Having recently abandoned my very-good on board audio for the O2/ODAC stack, I can say that the amplifier was the most important step up for the HE-400s. I just wanted more volume and now I have the power I need. The ODAC was not a very big improvement by comparison, since I felt the on-board had a very nice sound to it and was not rolled off or otherwise "colored" to my ears. But, the combo does give me a totally black noise floor, meaning there is no way I will every hear hiss again (unless it is in the recording). My on board sound was a bit more prone to hiccups / signal interference, depending on what I was doing, and there was definitely noise, though it was inaudible under normal listening conditions.
 
The combo does way less for my older HD 595s, which did not seem much improved by the extra power or resolution! Sooner or later I'll try my old 16 ohm sony IEMs to see if they love the lack of noise or not. In short, I am sure the amp will make a strong impression on you since the HE-400s scaled for me with a better power source. But don't count on a night and day improvement.

Great!  Good to hear.

 
You are correct regarding supply and demand.  However, when there is still a supply of new headphones for $400 and HifiMAN is able to keep up with the demand, then I don't believe that there is a justification for the said prices.  If HifiMAN had paused production, or stopped making the HE-400s, then I could see this happening.  I'd compare that situation to what we're seeing with the Denon "D" series of headphones.  The D2000 was down about $200 during its heyday, but now, they're selling for closer to $300, because Denon has new models out, and the other (and, perceived better) "D" series is still in demand.
 
Edit: What we're also seeing when the headphones are selling for those prices, they are priced at the point where one would have been able to return them within the return window.  Granted, the shipping costs to get them returned would take some funds, too. 
 
Now, this reminds me of the situations that typically come up in February of each year.  The Chinese New Year!  During a number of weeks, production in China shuts down as they celebrate the New Year.  So, items being sold are limited to stock on hand, and when they return to work, it takes a bit of time to ramp up.  The Chinese New Year for 2013 begins on February 10th. So, if anyone is on the fence regarding a HifiMAN purchase, then they should move on it in the next month, or one might face delays in getting their product, unless they locate their headphones from a vendor that has them in stock.
 
enjoy!

My babies sleeping... (400s, 500s, 4s)
 
Had a 3 hours session with the new HE-4 (on the right) on Friday night + a short shoot-out between the 3 during the weekend.
 
So far, with the Metrum Quad and the SA-31, my favourite is... the HE-4! Who would have expected that? Not me!
 
In a technical standpoint, they clearly fall short to the other 2.
- The instrument separation is inferior (they all have the new velours).
- Detail retrieval is hard to tell since the 4s have a treble emphasis (more so than the 400s on this setup) and a much more airy presentation that is hard to compare.
On complex passages, the 4s cannot compete with the 400s and 500s. Yet, they're still very good and much better than any dynamic headphones I owned/heard (which includes the K-701).
 
What I really (I mean REALLY) like about the 4s is their clean presentation and their V-shaped signature (probably more U-shaped) which makes them extremely fun to listen with fast paced music (e.g. Hard rock and Metal).
The bass emphasis starts below 50hz and stops quickly, hence the "U-shaped" response. By comparison, the 400s have a V-shaped response that emphasis the upper bass / lower mids region too.
As a result, the 4s have tighter bass when compared to the 400s, yet not as prominent (which has a good effect on overall clarity). This plus the treble emphasis make them extremely well suited for drums.
 
I never enjoyed AC/DC that much with the HE-500 because the mid emphasis is not suited to this particular music (it exhibits all the recording flaws). The 4s on the other hand, are simply excellent. The 400s are definitely closer to the 500s, being fuller sounding than the 4s.
 
I never expected I would like them more than my favourite of all time (the 500s) but I noticed some strange things that might be a result of my mood of the day or simply my ears not fully opened (I have a cold): the 500s sounded muffled. I always found the treble quantity more than adequate (rather would I say: ideal), on my setup. I don't know if listening to the 4s before the 500s biased my preferences but they clearly lacked treble.
 
I remember when I last tried my old 4s on the very same setup (difference RCA cables but I'm no cable believer...) I didn't quite like their treble quantity anymore... It seems like my ear changed in the meantime (overnight). 
 
Anyway, I'm happy with the 4s and if my cold is responsible for that change in treble perception, then I'm glad I have 2 pairs for the next time I have a cold :p
 
I forgot the bottom line: mix the 4s sound signature with the 400s technicalities and you get the best headphones for Metal / Hard-rock :p (No, I never heard grados, but they never heard orthos, so... :p)

While I agree with most of your impressions and I do understand this is your opinion.  I guess I just have a sort of different one.  So to speak. 
 
 
"In a technical standpoint, they clearly fall short to the other 2."
I would say this is the total opposite.  IMO The 4s are a more technical better headphone then the 400s and (500s ??)
 
Yes the 400s and 50ss are a fuller sounding headphone and yes the 4s has more air.  But the 4's does not not have the treble spikes the 400s has but has more of a treble energy.  Because of the bright airy sound.
 
The 500s don't lack treble.  It's just compared to the 4s as you said they don't have the same treble energy.  This is a result of the 4s being airy and the 500s being on the warm side.  IMO
 
"On complex passages, the 4s cannot compete with the 400s and 500s."
uumm.  I find the 4s one of the fastest headphones out and can keep up with just about any genre.  They just eat complex passages alive.  IMO..

For the "harshness", I didn't write it but also felt the 400s were more prone to it due to their dark signature. I prefere the 4s treble, no doubts.
 
As for technicalities, I stand by my opinion: I did not mean the 4s are slower, they aren't, but when many instruments are involved, it lacks the separation thats make them all distinguishable from each other. The 400s and, even more so, the 500s are more up to this task of delevering detail for every instruments on the scene.
 
There is also a difference in the mids presentation between the x00s and the 4s: I can hear all the reverb, the room's acoustic with the former 2 but not with the 4s. The 4s are less resolving because of this (that's probably because they have thinner mids).
 
As far as sound-stage go, the 4s sounded a bit smaller, maybe (maybe not) but that was not the first thing I noticed so it shouldn't be that different. I, however, noticed the more airy presentation, which is really cool.
 
Again, I don't know if I will still like them that much in the future (when my ears recover, my expectations bias in the x00s dirrection, my mood changes...) but I any cases, if I had to buy a < $500 pair, I would seriously consider these headphones.
They require power, that's for sure and the warm signature of the SA-31 makes for a very good pairing in the $1k range.

Hey guys, I'm new here even though I've been lurking for years. I recently purchased the HE-400's from Justin @ Head-Amp and have now had a few days to get used to them.I absolutely LOVE them. I came from Shure SRH440's, so the step up was pretty drastic. I spent months reading threads here on headphones under $500 and finally settled on the HiFiMan's, and I'm extremely glad I did. My biggest contender was the HD600, which I plan to buy later anyway. 
 
The one thing I noticed right away was that despite what others have said, I don't believe these are an ideal purchase if you don't plan on amplifying them. I first ran mine on my iPod and felt a bit uneasy because it was nothing like I had expected. The volume struggled tremendously, so I plugged up my E11 and experienced a whole different set of headphones. They really started to feel like I had purchased worthy phones. It wasn't until later that night when I randomly decided to plug them in to my Pioneer receiver and turn on Pandora that I experienced what these cans can actually do. They awoke like a sleeping giant. They were no longer docile with my ears and screamed with perfection (to me) no matter how high I cranked them. I think I finally settled on 58-60 on my knob as the ideal listening level, despite them still sounding awesome at 70.
 
So while I'm just a beginner in this very complex world of audio equipment and my judgement should be taken with a grain of salt, I just wanted to clear that up from a beginners viewpoint. These are AWESOME headphones for the price, but you should plan to amplify them!  The upside is that it's apparent that you don't have to spend a thousand dollars on an amp/dac setup to really push these -- which is great.
 
I plan on ordering the Magni/Modi next. After hearing these on my receiver, I can no longer settle with my soundcard + E11 :P
 
PS. For anyone who hasn't ordered yet, Justin @ Head-Amp was awesome to buy from. He shipped my headphones out the same day, and had them at my door 3 days later. His price was great too (free s&h and free velour pads)

thanks a lot for your answers
 
very interesting about he-4
 
after what I heard from orthos there is no way back to dynamic headphones even perfectly driven hd600  (they were my favourite cans especially for texturing, neutrality and harmonics, although they missed impact, weight and soundstage of he5le)
 
there is very nice price in europe for he4 and I have read they have many in common with he5le indeed (single ended version of he5le ?)
 
usually I listen to many genres but what I like the most is piano (impact and harmonics especially with some lower octaves - you know what I mean, http://youtu.be/bsSOL9c8xaE?t=45m24s ), female vocals, small jazz bands, atmosphere, air, "magic in the air" but always with great weight and nice soundstage, width
 
how about he4 playing cellos with much texture / layering and digging enough low freq ? he5le were amazing playing yo yo ma (bach cellos) for instance - like real life experience, so much speed, clarity, weight and texture without a hint of distortion, but when I can buy he4 for 40% of he5le price this is very tempting option
 
how about he4 retermination for 4 pin xlr neutrik on stock cable + audio-gd nfb 10.32 directly to 4 pin xlr (about 10W per channel for 32Ohm and about 6W per channel for 50Ohm, fully balanced dac+amp in one box, wm8741, no capacitors, no feedbacks, all discrete, no opamps, r-core) ? or maybe some cheap speaker amp like nuforce icon amp and my own source ?
 
one more thing - I really like to listen a bit louder than others but this is the moment when orthos come to life and really shine

We understand the portability issues with the HE-400, and I'm fine with it.  If I do take music on the road, it's usually during a somewhat distracting moment, so having the best possible sound at that period of time, isn't the priority.  However, having good sound is.  I think there are many ways to get a "travel rig" built just to have for such events.  The older iPod Classic 5 / Video, which comes in 30GB and 60GB configurations, features the "end of the line" good Wolfson DAC built in and is the last generation before Apple stopped using the Wolfson DAC chips.  The sound of a newer iPod touch can't compare to the "Classic" - but, it has to be the configurations that I've mentioned.  Apple currently makes "Classic" models, but they are not the same as the older, version # 5 varieties.  I'd then use a more portable and suitable pair of headphones - but one which would provide you with the richness of sound that you are used to with the HE-400 at home.  My choice would be the JVC HA-S500, which is imported from Japan and is available on Amazon for $53.00.  The headphone is crazy good for that price.

HI everyone.
 
After a month of using the HE-400 im quite ready to give my final impression on the headphones :D.
 
I have changed my feeling in many songs that i felt too agressive for my ears, to "quality of the recording is too low to listen to this crap".
 
For example, i always loved Linking Park, but many of their songs were too strident for me (hurting my ears). After using the 400s i can enjoy every song from this group.
Now, i use the Fiio E17 and i will most likely be looking for an upgrade, as i would not settle for lower quality at this point.
 
Also, i am eliminating almost every single non FLAC song i got, except a few i have a special sentiment to.
 
On another note, Volume cant be "too loud" for me anymore, but my ears do remind me from time to time that i should not be a dumbass.
 
On the Treble and Bass settings from the E17, i have both at 0 right now, yet i had to use -6 on treble at start, so i belive the burn in helps a bit here. (or my own ears got use to it).
 
Definitly an amazing investment, highly recommended, and remindment to use them for at least a month to really get the hang of them.
 
My next step is probably going to be Hifiman Flagship with best amp out there (when i win the lotery or somethin like that).
 
Time to give my wallet a small rest (still need aftermarket cable and velour pads thou).

Damn, finally decided to go with he400, the newest revision (transparent magnet's supporter - rev 4), I guess I can drive them easily with any decent source and normal amplifier for now
 
I have an occassion to get ef5 pretty cheap too so maybe later I will try this combination
 
I can send it back if I dont like it so there is no risk (and then I will buy he4 +lyr or ef5), some of you guys said they do piano amazing, especially impact and reverbation so it might be really what I am looking for (a bit more bass might be helpful here when hitting lower octaves) and sound great with ortho signature from anything even portable devices
 
I was even thinking about getting back to my previous, pretty nice icon hdp as a combo for them but I have no idea about the synergy
 
Maybe I will order velour pads to have some alternative in case there is too much bass or too recessed mids (for piano)

Just adding a bit to this - I think many people have way too high expectations on how much amplifiers (and DAC's) improve sound. I've personally tried computer on-board sound, some cheap computer sound cards, a couple of semi-cheap DAC's and headphone amp combos, up to stuff like the Dacmagic Plus I'm using myslef right now. Do I hear differences between the gear? Yes I do, but really, even when comparing computer on-board sound to the DM Plus where there's basically a 600$ difference I'd be hard pressed to say that the increase in sound quality is over two times (if you really have to get a number). This might be a touchy subject but I think many times people exaggerate the improvement to justify the money spent 
 
This obviously depends on how hard to drive the headphones are etc, but in general - people should worry more about the headphones and less about the source, especially with not so picky headphones like the HE-400. While I haven't tried the M&M stack I'd be suprised if they didn't provide you with about 95% of the sound these headphones have to offer.

For those interested in what I feel of the K702 Annies (first impressions)
Just got the K702 Anniversary.Holy balls.
These are gorgeous. Prior to these, I owned the white K701 and white Q701, The finish on those was almost like a toilet white. Porcelain. The Annies though? The finish is matte, and looks AMAZING. I mean, I thought I was used to how the K/Q's looked, then I saw these... I'm blown away just looking at them.
Then I put them on my head, no sound... just... OMFG. I always raved about the Steelseries Siberia and their self adjustment. Those were nearly perfect. I wish the cups were bigger on those (they were small and not deep.)
The K701 and Q701 had similar self adjustment, but for whatever reason, they were always fully extended and hella tight on my head. Then there was the bumps on the headband that were torturous. Pure torture until you wore them long enough to not mind them, but they never truly disappear.
Here comes the K702 Annies. Not only did they do away with the bumps, but the headband no longer pulls down on my head. I wonder if it's because the bumps are gone, leaving more space for just enough extension to not make them so tight. The cups clamp so lightly, I almost thought these were Audio-Technicas for a moment. They clamp just tight enough to feel secure, but it's light.
Speaking of light I mean, these babies are LIGHT. I mean, wearing the HE400 next to them is...well, they surely feel like bricks on the head next to the Annies.
HOLY COW. These ARE the most comfortable full-sized headphones I have owned, bar none. It is indeed perfection.
Comfort...10/10
These are IT.
On to the most important part...sound.
Before I start, let me state that I do NOT suffer from new toy syndrome. If I'm not impressed, I will be the first to say it. I will be quick to mention the pros and cons in a headphone's sound.
So what did I hear when I first turned on the music?
Warmth. Clarity. Openness. Refinement.
This is surely a refined Q701. Not only does it sound fuller than I remember of the Q701, but the bass. Dear god... the bass. What. The. CRAP? These have FANTASTIC bass. I will tell you right now, this is the most balanced headphone I have heard that ALSO has a satisfying amount of bass. The DT880 is also incredibly balanced with bass, but they have that treble peak. These DO NOT.
I am absolutely MINDBLOWN by the Annies. I paid $429 for these... and I will tell you all right now, that yes, it's worth it over the Q701, and I would seriously choose these over the HE-400 if I could only own one. The HE-400 is amazing, simply amazing, but the K702 Annies has this balance between fun and straight business without any glaring faults that make them so damn enticing.
This is one of those times that I can't find anything bad to say about the sound.
They really DO sound like a mix between the Q701 and HD650. It is a perfect blend. Just.... lovely.
Stay tuned.
My faves have changed...in order.

Hey there, another happy HE-400 owner, just got them today.
 
Out of the box, I was disappointed.  I was like wut, where's the hype.  Why does everything sound so MUDDY?  
Then I realized I was listening to indie rock with the Fiio E17's bass boost turned up 6 steps.  Whoops.
(Question to those using the HE-400/Fiio E17, what gain setting are you using?)
 
Turned off the bass boost, restarted the song.  Things are sounding pretty good.  In fact, with Grizzly Bear - Two Weeks (my go-to first listen for any new headphone) I definitely was hearing astonishing clarity in Ed Droste's voice like I never heard before.
 
I tried the velours.  Didn't like them comfort wise, and didn't hear a difference in the sound.  Oh well, with less than an hour on them I didn't think I would be able to anyway.  Put the comfies back on and I'm chillin.
 
Two hours later, I'm starting to get acclimated to these.  Jigsaws are falling into place, to use a Radiohead reference.  In fact, I put on "Paranoid Android" and I was pleased with how smooth the sound was.  Loving the midrange that virtually everyone has raved about.  
 
Dream Theater - Stream of Consciousness floored me.  (that is a spotify link)   I'm not much of a metal fan or a Dream Theater fan, but that song and the HE-400's got along so nicely, that after 11 minutes went by, it felt closer to 4 or 5 minutes instead.
  
Definitely satisfied with the $400 I paid for these.  And I'm sure they will open up even more the more I listen to them.

Haven't posted anything since I first got the HE-400 weeks ago, but that was because I haven't been listening much (well, and was out of town for a while too).
 
Lately I've been listening a lot to both the Fostex TH900 and Stax OII MKI which are obviously a lot more expensive than the HE-400. But that gave me incentive to listen to it, to find out how it stacked up against some seriously expensive headphones, and I have to say, the HE-400 is pretty awesome relative to the TH900 and OII! I'll get around to a mini-review of it eventually to give it its due praise (and nitpicks of course), but for now I'll just say that it's really good, and it's extremely likely that it's going to end up in my "above average" ranking of headphones which is probably the highest compliment that I can give it.
 
I haven't tested it on my Schiit Magni yet, which I also need to spend more listening time on. Have only tried it out of the Burson Soloist so far, which seems like a solid amp, but I'll know more once I directly compare it to the Magni.

I have just received my new he-400 :D
 
out of the sony d-25 (multibit pcm66 dac inside, remember the time when I was in possession of latest ES sony sacd source xa5400es - couldn't tell the difference between them, shocked how good it is) vintage pcdp with extremely nice headphone amplifier is pretty good - amazing delicacy, nice balanced sound with proper impact, d-25 is very neutral, fast and has great resolution and imaging - real copy of xa5400es (they do everything as well as hd600 or better, so I can easily let them go, actually I find he400 much more comfortable despite the weight  - there is almost no clamping force which is great)
 
however so far it's far from what I heard listening to he5le + ef5 + sacd xa5400es
 
need to try it from sony d-50 mkII (more powerful headphone amp, symetric power supply, and multibit dac pcm55 - very, very nice sounding player, thick sound with great bass and dynamics)
 
next to go will be my galaxy s3 with wolfson just to please my curiosity
 
and in the end I will try to pump some real power using my vintage receiver + some nice source and many different CDs, genres ...

comparing to perfectly driven hd600 (driven by wa6 sophia+pdps+6fd7 / zana deux / rudistor rpx-33 ev-08, sources: arcam alpha 9 dcs ring dac / electrocompaniet ecd-1 / sony sacd xa5400es / icon hdp dac which are best combinations I have heard with hd600 regarding the price IMO) he400 on neutral and fast sony d-25 there is outstanding clarity, vocals are extremely smooth although slightly laid back IMO, no even small hint of sibilance which is really appreciated)
 
from what I recall comparing to he5le I find he400 too polite and smooth :) he5le was a raw power, brutality and neutrality, faster with more precision but there is definately great fun to listen to he400, need more time to listen to, these are first 2 hours and first 2 CDs
 
I guess neutral, fast, high resolution source is best match for he400
 
I am really starting to like these headphones, especially with warm sounding jazz recordings like pat metheny & anna maria jopek album - simply amazing, he400 just got the proper temperature because right out of the box they were pretty cold :D there is -2 C today in Poland, maybe it's my brain burn-in or temperature change shifted tonal balance a bit in a great direction

Damn, they are good with jazz and female vocals, with genres like atb (trilogy album) soundstage layering ability is quite similar to nicely driven hd650 (actually they are first headphones which came to my mind that sound very close to them but with better bass control and resolution, piano sounds darker exactly like on hd650 thus better impact for lower octaves but there are lost higher harmonics which are perfectly heard on hd600 and that was the thing I could not live with hd650), great plans separation and imaging but now I am starting to realize what is missed comparing to he5le ...
 
It's a bit too early but I think transients, texturing  and details of he5le are something what gives that unbelievable sense of realism and put them in completely different league (although sometimes a bit treble for my liking, but much more information in this area too) when we talk about headphones but of course it's just my own, subjective, personal opinion
 
edit: for sure he400 are killers for rnb, rap, drum n bass, hip-hop
 
for instance on something like erykah badu - baduism they simply wipe the floor with hd600/650 and I guess with many other headphones

Received my pair yesterday, first thing I did was put the velours on.  I also noticed I have the transparent color (rev. 4 aka 2 I guess)  Listened to the HE-400 for 11 hours yesterday straight through except for an hour dinner break.  These things are much more comfortable compared to the Audeze, I only wish the earcups could be a little bigger.
 
Here are some thoughts from the first day of owning them:  I don't feel I'm missing anything in the bass, if anything it feels a little faster and tighter than the Audeze to me.  The mids on the Audeze are the best I've ever heard, however the HE-400 is no slouch here.  I listen to mostly female vocals and they sound really good.  I'm enjoying the HE-400 treble much more than the LCD-2's, I'm picking up sounds I've never heard before on any headphone I've owned... nice!  Soundstage is also great on the HE-400, it's much more open sounding than the LCD-2 more like the HD650 in this regard.  The Audeze sounds like I'm listening in a narrow hallway while the HE-400 sounds like i'm in a open room.
 
Really enjoying these much more than I thought I would.  For the price the HE-400 are an absolute steal.
