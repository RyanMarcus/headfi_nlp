Rank your headphones. Please rank your headphones that you own and use regularly. Please don’t list or rank headphones that you use to own or that you have tried. My goal here is to have a positive outlook ranking, not a product bashing list. I figure that if you own and use them, you must like them. Right?
My list.

Well truthfully I only use the top 2 regularly (sometimes #3 too) for critical listening, but I've put a lot of time on most of these cans at some point.Edit: Broke the tie in the top 2 slots. Upon further listening with my new Meridian G08, the 650 + Zu is sounding like the better all-around can.

Greetings from Hannover!

I'm just starting out, but fairly happy with #1 & #2, (though I do need a new closed can in the near future to replace #3). Here is my ranking of current phones:
1) HD595
2) MD33
3) Senn EH2200 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My Cans:1. Sennheiser HD 650/Zu-XLR: warm, inviting sound that always works for me; I never tire of its presentation and character - the HD580/600/650 has been my sound for over 2 1/2 years now
2. AKG K 1000: more resolving than the HD650/Zu-XLR but doesn't sound as cohesive and isn't as universally enjoyable as the HD650 to me; the presentation the K1000 achieves is certainly unique, however
3. Beyerdynamic DT770-80: these really are much better than their 250ohm brethren, and they are now my third favorite sealed headphones (right behind the K271 and DT250-250); the fact that they are the most comfortable sealed cans of all IMO (the silver velour is still unmatched and the headband is perfect once Kramer’s mod is performed) is why they're sitting atop my head as a type this at work
4. Alessandro MS1: a tad bright and tonally lightweight, but it's the best semi-portable open 'phone I've encountered and it lends nearly all genres a fun spin
5. Sennheiser HD25-1: the most portable full-sized headphone; this 'phone is warm and fun with great impact and clarity (especially when the stock steel cable is upgraded to OFC copper); they're not the most neutral or detailed sealed cans, and the clamping can grow wearisome (even with the velour pads and ample break-in/stretching), but for portable usage I have not found a more appropriate solution
6. Koss KSC-75: colored, a tad bloated and oh-so-fun! These classic cans started life as the KSC35 and PortaPro and the same basic design is still a winner - the resolution is startling for their price, and they fit snugly inside a beanie
7. Sennheiser MX 400-RC: these earbuds were included with my iRiver and while they cannot compare with the aforementioned cans above, they do hold their own and are some of the best 'buds around; the fact that they're ~ $10 only sweetens the package (I still listen to 'em every once in a while to remind myself of the average listening experience and I still have a blast with them on - it's the music, stupid!)
EDIT: Actually I think I prefer the DT770-80 to the MS1... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

#1: Audio technica a500 <- good soundstage and detail. great for all around use (gaming/all sorts of genres)
#2: Alessandro MS-1 <- wicked rock headphones, but not as good as the a500s when it comes to a mixed playlist and for gaming.
#3: Sharp MD33 <- good for portable use. Weaker bass, little bit tinny sounding and some nasty microphonics when I'm moving about. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

This list is comprised of all headphones I own (or at least I've located in the house).
Technically, #1 and #2 are tied, for each has a solely different purpose, and I love them both.
1) Audio Technica ATH-A900
1) Future Sonics EM3
3) Nakamichi SP-7
4) Bang & Olufsen A8
5) Sony MDR-G74SL
6) Sony MDR-W20G
7) every other crappy bud that came with various players over the years that are now collecting dust 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) Stax SR Lambda Pro Classic
2.) Stax SR-5 Gold
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro
4.) AKG K-501
5.) AKG K-14 P
The Lambda is the clear winner. Best frequency range and the quickest can I have, also a great soundstage and very comfortable. The SR-5 gains place 2 because it has the best soundstage and a very nice warm sound.
The decision between place 3 & 4 is hard: The Beyer has a great soundstage, a great frequency range but is a bit too bright, boomy & slow for my taste. The K-501 has definitely the nicest and warmest sound, is the most comfortable one, is very quick but misses a bit at the upper and lower end of the frequency spectrum. I think I grab the Beyer a bit more often.
The K-14P isn't bad, it shares some of the good points of it's big brother, but as an earbud it's too far behind. But it plays in a different league than my noisey Knopex IRHP-200 IR Headphone and the cheap earbuds (philips, sangean, noname china) that I have. The original iPod earbud is still in it's sealed package, as I know it's probably too bad for me. I can't rate these budget phones as I don't listen with them anymore.

Don't laugh at the KSC-35 being above the DT770. The DT770 is a necessity when I can't use the SR200 (late at nite, etc) So otherwise I'd be using the SR200. The KSC-35 just does portable cans right, period. I'd put the ATH-CM3 as 4) but they are my wife's.

Interesting trend there, eh? The 590's are computer headphones and hence see the most use. The ER-4P never leaves my pocket, and is therefore second. The 404 and 001 are reserved for serious listening, and unfortunately, I only have so much time for that

Alessandro MS-2: fairly clear, energetic sounding but laid back at the same time, tight bass but not very prominent on my setup, dry and bright mids (IMO), not overly forgiving and dry highs with fairly good extention with bowls.Koss KSC-35: slightly bloated bass, dark mids, rolled off highs - BUT HELLA FUN!! I find these more enjoyable with Rock music than on the MS-2, but they dont do other types of music as good.Audio Technica ATH-EM7 bass is only "there" when pressed against ears or when wearing a beanie, veiled vocals, prominent upper mids, distorted sounding, extremely rolled off highs. Selling ASAP.

I have not made up my mind yet which I like better...I will say this, the 2 are VERY different. I have had the AKGs since 1986, and have had the Grado SR60 for less than a year...Also I use them in 2 different environments, the AKGs in a powerful Class A Amp, (which is hooked up to a pair of nice JBL 4411 Control Monitors when not using headphones) and the Grados in a unamped iPod. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

Taking both my wife's and my own cans:
9.5/10. Sony MDR SA5000: unbeatable for classical, jazz, vocals, guitar. Upper treble very "alive" (unbeatable?) and detail that to me surpasses even my etys. Bass goes very low. Superb stereo separation and not bad soundstage. Comfort is excellant with no need to seek a break yet. I only gave these babies a 9.5 score because there must be something better out there that I have not heard.
9.2/10. MS-pros: unbeatable for heavy rock. Bass slam that can be so good it hurts! Great detail. Sound signature that seems to add bass because of that mid bass hump. What's soundstage? Comfort is better than the MS-2 because of a better headband and lighter weight. Three hours is common without problem for me.
9/10 MS-2. Hard to fault with rock. Very fast and almost indistinguishable from MS-pros in terms of dynamics and sound. Slightly clearer in classical to my ears but maybe very slightly less character in hard rock (ms-pros have wood after all). Three hours max in the comfort meter stakes because my wife won't let me bend the headband.
8.5/10. Etymotic 4P/4S. To me there is not a big deal about the P/S difference. In general I prefer the 4P configeration. Great detail. Bass that is good and well defined but not overpowering (some call this recessed). No bass in noisy environments though (ambient bass can overpower the etys). Upper treble is good but cannot compare to the Sony SA5000 by any measure. Foamies give great comfort for me, six hours no problem. When listening in a very quite room these are truely great cans.
6.6/10. Sony MDR888 earbuds. Fantastic musicality and for earbuds they are my favourites. Good treble and bass for earbuds. Positioning is tricky and they move when you do... falling out sometimes...
5.5/10. Sharp MD33 canalphones. Good sound. Great comfort. My favourite cycling cans. Acceptable detail and musicality.
5/10. Portapros. Not really balanced frequency response. But comfortable and capable of powerful bass. A bit wearing after a while because of the bass. No real wow factor once you get over the bass thing.
4/10. Sony EX71. Good for comfort. Great single note bass. No upper treble I can find. Adequate at best.

To me, this is like ranking apples and tomatoes and bananas. I love banana bread. I don't want an apple on my steak and cheese sub, and I don't want a tomato pie. But I love them all.
For moving around:
1. Shure E3 w/ triple flange
For sitting still in a noisy environment:
1. Ety ER4 w/ triple flange
For sitting still in a quiet environment:
1. Grado SR 225

point made 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Sennheiser HD650 (w/Zu and Headphile XLR) - For as long as I've been in this hobby, I've been a Senn guy. The sound is just so warm, full and smooth to me.2) Sony MDR-SA5000 - Wow, the clarity of the sound is quite eye opening. The highest compliment? Made me rethink whether I was indeed a Senn guy.3) Grado SR325i - There are some music and some amps that I just don't like with this, but otherwise it's an incredibly fun, forward headphone. The sound is bright and punchy without being sibilant.4) Sony MDR-CD3000 - I don't listen to this nearly enough and I suspect that if I did, it might creep up to #3. Haven't place my finger on how to describe the sound. Everyone says they're bright and I agree, but they also have a liquidity to the sound.5) Beyerdynamic DT531 - The "groovalizers" is an appropriate name. Very smooth, warm sound with good bass. Not quite as detailed as the cans above.6-tie) Beyerdynamic DT250-250 - Currently my closed cans of choice. The sound is dark and easy to listen to.6-tie) Audio Technica ATH-A900 - Formerly my closed cans of choice. They sound a little honky in comparison to the CD3k and DT250 but they're solid all-around performers and are easy to drive.8) Sennheiser HD25-1 - Very light which makes them ideal for portable use. I haven't tried the cable upgrade yet but I plan to. The sound is punchy and crisp.9) KSC-35 - While they may be #9 on my list, I strongly believe they represent the best value on this list. I'm continually amazed by the sound out of these cheap cans. Some say the bass is sloppy but I think it's perfect.10) Sony MDR-V6 - One of my first high quality headphones. They are a little bright and sibilant for extended use but they do have a wow factor for those new to the hobby11) Shure e3c - When I upgraded from the e2c, it was like a veil was lifted over the sound. You do lose some bass, but it's actually not bad at all with an amp.12) Sennheiser MX400 - Ridiculously good sound for $15. Nuff said. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Ety ER-4P - My favorites for sound quality. I use these mostly as my portables.
Grado SR125 - I listen with these at hoome when using my computer as source.
Sony MDR-F1 - I like these while watching DVDs, especially on the treadmill.

4. Senn MX500 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. HD580 (Oehlbach) - in terms of sonic quality, the clear winner of my cans. Bests the 595 with a velvet-smooth midbass through midrange to lower treble (without grain), extended highs, better detail, bass impact, and a more refined presentation. (From my description it does seem like a big difference compared to the 595, but realistically, the 595 is nearly as good). When using the stock cable however, the 580 is not as good as the 595.
2. HD595 - in terms of enjoyment, this would be #1. It has a certain quality to it that makes music more fun to listen to. It is very involving (envelops you in sound), comfortable, and something that can be listened to for hours without fatigue. My only (extremely minor) complaints include a little grain in the mids and lower treble and despite the fact that there's plenty of bass and it extends nicely, there isn't enough bass impact - for instance a bass drum sounds too "polite."
3. HD25-1 (Stock HD580 Cable) - when isolation is important
4. KSC-75 - I don't miss my Grado's thanks to these (ok... they're no Grado headphone but they come reasonably close and are just as fun and I can't help but smile when I think about what I paid for them)
5. PX200 - I'm one of the lucky ones who can get a great seal - LOADS of bass. Mids are honky and the highs roll off pretty dramatically, but for really portable closed phones that offer some minor isolation, I can accept the shortcomings. The honkiness and the highs can be fixed with EQ. I smile too when I remember that I only paid $29 for them.
6. MX400 - Just a great ultra-portable solution. They sound pretty good flat, but a little EQ can add some nice bass presence and make them sound like full-sized cans. I don't need to say anything about the price  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Sennheiser HD-580 - I got these after the ATH-A900's, they sound a whole lot better. If I could completely silenced my computer and my roommates i'd enjoy them a ton more.
2. Audio-Technica ATH-A900 - the isolation is a plus up at college.
3. Audio-Technica ATH-FC7 - they sound alright, but are very uncomfortable to me after long periods of time. I don't listen to these at all unless I go on vacation.

They made this headphone as a "special edition" around 1985 at the jubilee of 25 years SR-1 (The first electrostatic headphone of the world). It's basically the 1975 design SR-5 with a refined diaphragm (2 Micrometer instead of 5 Micrometer) and all metal parts are gold covered. The white plastic parts have been replaced with black plastic parts. It has been produced until the end of the old Stax and was the ultimate choice for an audiophile until the Orpheus showed up (around 1991 ?). Nowadays you can find them very often on german eBay for not much money.
This is a normal SR-5: SR-5

Here's my current ranking based on overall enjoyment, not technical accuracy.
1. Grado PS-1/bowls
2. Grado RS-1/flats
3. Senn HD-650/Zu
4. Grado HP-1/flats
They're all really good, and on any given day the order can be completely different. The RS-1 gets the most use because my iRiver can drive it directly - very handy at work.
Too new to rank, but very nice so far: Beyer DT-880.

It's not that it would take too long (I'm retired.....I got plenty of time), it's the fact that I actually enjoy all of them. For example, today I listened to the Sharp D33 (comfy), the Sony D66 Eggos (balanced), and the ATH EW9 (detailed). Each one did something better than the other.........tough to rank. Same goes for my full-sized cans. I really do enjoy each of them for what they do. None of them are perfect.

I am not a Senn guy every now and then... Plus, I simply enjoyed the D66 when it goes with an umamped rig. HD-600 just can't do that kind of stunt.

Headphones I've owned long enough to compare here. The first four reviews in the list were all based on listening via my Pimeta w/OPA637's. Pictures of most of my audio setup are here.
There is no real clear winner here at this point because they each have their own strengths and weaknesses as well as I haven't had enough listening time on the first two in the list. Headphones #5 - 7 were just thrown in because I've owned them.
1. Philips HP1000 w/cable mod by PinkFloyd (easily the best $75 I've ever spent on a headphone). I just received these 'phones brand new and they are still burning in. So far they do everything better than my HP890's (look at that review below) except that the bass does not extend quite as low, it is tighter overall however so the HP1000 wins out. The soundstage on these is simply wonderful, it is huge with so much seperation, detail and dynamics. They beat the HD600 in the soundstage department IMHO. The vocals and highs are quite a bit improved over the HP890's. The vocals on the HP890's often had the tendency to sound somewhat recessed which I can say without a doubt that the HP1000's have fixed!! These are crisper and somewhat brighter than the HD600's. The HP1000's are as comfortable as the HP890's and they contain a higher build quality. The ear pieces (which are a tad smaller in thickness and width compared to the HP890's) on these should not ever sag on your ears which was a complaint by a minor amount of people about the HP890's. The build quality is high, a little higher than the HP890's but I haven't owned them long enough to know for sure. I would rate them as equal to HD600's for comfort while laying down in bed. The HD600's are smaller in overal size by a fair amount but they get a little hotter around my ears because of their cloth material and can tend to give a irritating feeling vs the HP1000's softer velvet material that doesn't irritate, but the HP1000's are larger on your head, the HD600 uses a two-sided cable and the HP1000 uses a one-sided cable, so there are going to be tradeoffs on the two. It would come down to personal preference on that issue. The HP1000's look almost as silly on your head as the HP890's, the difference is these look a lot more futuristic! They do have a classy look while wearing them like the HD600's but while the HD600's have a classy understated look while being worn, these tend to make you look like a futuristic space cadet. These use the same great silky no snag material headphone cable as the HP890's did as stock. A replacement cable can be had for both of the Philips since the Sennheiser HD590 cable is fully compatible with them. I would never want to switch cables because I love the feel of the stock one. Come with a pretty awesome full size velvet storage case. A headphone amp is required on these. High sound leakage from the drivers.
2. Sennheiser HD600 w/HD650 cable. Just to note, I've only owned these a week before my Philips HP1000's arrived so I'm still getting used to the sound on them. They do most everything right, the midrange is the best part, it's quite rich and detailed. They are laid back however compared to the HP1000's. They contain a SMOOTH open sound, allows you to hear all of the little nuances of the original recording. These have a sweet rich buttery midrange detail, more so than any other headphone I own. The HD600's have a more relaxing sound to them compared to the Philips, they would be easier to fall asleep to - that isn't a bad thing. Bass freaks will shy away from these, it just does not extend deep enough for the bass-heads but what it has is good. Sometimes I feel that the treble could be improved somehow but I couldn't put my finger on it exactly. The HD600's are comfortable headphones but they are smaller and tend to have more clamping force compared to both of the Philips. Also I find that the cloth material on the ear pieces gets hotter than the velvet material of the HP890/1000's. The carbon fiber headband looks really cool! A headphone amp is absolutely required for these, more so than any other headphone I own. The HD600's are the best looking phone while being worn compared to all of the others here, they contain an understated classy look and the carbon fiber really adds to that while barely any plastic is seen at all. The HD600's are tied with the HP1000 for comfort while laying down in bed, there are tradeoffs on both but I'd still say they tie. The stock cable has to go though, at the very least replace it with a HD650 stock cable for both the much thicker cable (more than twice as thick) and better looking and thicker earpiece connectors! High sound leakage from the drivers.
3. Philips HP890 w/cable mod by PinkFloyd. I've owned and put listening time on these headphones for two years longer than the two 'phones above. Quite easily the BEST sub $65 I could have ever spent on a headphone. Discovered them on Head-Fi, they were not available for sale in US. This is the most comfortable headphone I think I've used for extended wear, although the HD600 is not far behind it. The huge velvet ear pillows are a big part of the comfort factor. They have the best stock cable I've ever had, the covering on it is silky smooth and lightweight yet durable. My cable was modded to terminate in a 1/4" connector instead of 1/8". It is a joy to use and is a one sided type of headphone cable. The sound signature is quite a bit different than the headphone above, even though they get compared to each other, one thing that the HP890's certainly have is a high fun factor. The bass goes deep but can sound wooly. They contain a nice open sound with high seperation. The treble is the main thing that lets it down, it can be too bright and sometimes gets a bit shrill. Vocals have the tendency to get recessed which is something that the HP1000's definately fix! One of the least fatiguing sounding phones I've listened to. It is behind the HP1000 and HD600's for comfort while laying down in bed because of its larger/thicker earcups and the alien looking double band at the top of the headphone extends far above your head (sticks out). These guys sound a LOT better on a good headphone amp, I would not bother with them without one. Some have suffered from cracking around the drivers but mine have been just fine after two owners. Come with a nice full size upright headphone stand to store them on. High sound leakage from the drivers.
4. Sennheiser HD535 w/HD650 cable. I bought these new at Good Guys way back in 1998 for around $200. I have had to replace an entire driver on them because I tried to fix a loose cable connection problem and ended up ruining an entire driver (very delicate to work on). Contains the classic Sennheiser sound signature but it is not as mature as the HD600's sound. Very comfortable to wear but they give off somewhat of a flimsy plastic feel because of the headband and area surrounding the drivers. The bass is different I think it can go deeper but it is not as controlled, midrange and detail is not as good as the HD600.
5. Sony MDR-CD780. Something about the treble on them annoyed me, it got fatiguing. The stock cable that came with these was very stiff and course which I just could not get used to at all (I hear there were two types of cables made for the CD780's, one smooth and one course). The worst thing about the cable that these came with was that whenever the cable moved on your body it was very audible through the headphones! The cloth earpads got quite warm after only 30 minutes of use. I only kept these for a few days, the comfort was not there.
6. Sony MDR-7506 (same as Sony MDR-V6). The treble was far too fatiguing, didn't do much well unless you count bass. They may have some deep bass but I don't think it was tight & controlled bass. Somewhat muddy midrange and poor treble, lack of detail. These could make a fairly good portable phone. Has a well put together feel and might look better on your head than a lot of portable phones. They got too hot for me on the ears indoors.
7. Sony MDR-V600. These did not do anything right as far as I can remember.

-hp2-HD650 + Ohelback cable
( turning on XLR someday )
the most cohesive and nice sound across a lot of genres , the better right tone across many instruments / voices , but somewhat tiring on the long listentings because of their bulkiness and weight , and a unfortunately touch too warm . 380$
-modded Akg k501
(mods = tapes , angled drivers , smashed pads )
A good alternative to HD650 when i don't want any weight on the head, very smooth and involving sound. 150$-Panasonic RP-F400
( you have to try them , i don't know why no one ever noticed them here )
My first pair of serious? headphones; they rock between the grados and the akg k501, when drived from ppa their performance are so good you can't stand their low price, and they weight less then k501. Great on portables too.
Don't get the F500 or the F800 as they are not any better . 50$-Westone UM2
( the right performers on portable )
If you can spend a bit of money on canalphones , these are a no brainer. 300$.
-Ksc35 / Sportapro
headphones that started my portable head-fi journey , which i still use and like. 30$

I have a couple more than this but I will only list the ones I currently use on a regular basis.
1. HD-650 w/ Zu Mobius
2. UE-10 pro
3. ER4-P/S
4. PX-100 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Ranked in the order i listen to the most
1) hd580 with hd650 cable and hd600 grills (very natural and balanced sound)
I probably put around 5 hours a day on these. I love them to death.
2) mx400 (great for portable use). This hardly gets any use as i dont listen portably as much anymore.
3) Everything else i sold including hd212pro, k401, a500
4) hd457 (first headphone). I still have this and only keeping it for sentimental reasons.

This sounds fine!
But I value the all-round thing over all, so -- how do the bass (depth) and the treble (presence, extension, detail) compare with the 595 ?
And what about the sense of richness of timbre on strings, wind instruments etc. ?

3) Grado HP-2

The rest are the same as before. I just got the K1000, so I need to live with it a while longer, though I'm sure it will at least end up in the top 2 along with the K340. I've been on a real AKG kick lately, it seems. Is team AKG in my near future? I'm not sure they'd want me...

Wow, I've heard the V600 before and I can say that the Sony SA5000 has to be awfully bad to deserve such a rating.
...unless you really think the V600 are that good .
I don't know, giving the V600 an eight on a scale of 1 - 10 (with RS1 placed at a nine) sounds like crazy talk to me.

Yes, such a rating is insane, not just unreasonable. I have heard the V600 on numerous occasions. That 'phone just didn't come anywhere close to making my top 20 list, in my judgment. If I still had that 'phone, I would rate it only a three on a scale of 1-10: I've heard worse headphones, but not at a price point that's anywhere near as high as what the V600 sold for. (By comparison, every single headphone on my top 20 list would score at least a six on that same 1-10 scale.)
On the other hand, I have never heard any of the MDR-SA#### series. Thus, I cannot rank the MDR-SA5000 at all yet. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

From all that I have left:
1. Ety ER-4S
2. Grado SR60
3. Sennheiser HD 497
There's definitely something missing with the ety's, but nevertheless they have the most detailed treble I've ever heard in my life. I think they are way too analytical for my taste though, especially paired with my gilmore. Perhaps a warmer source will bring out the best in them.
I'll consider where the HD600's shall fall once I get them

Ya know, I started out with that V600 headphone on the bottom of my list; but, honestly, it would have been a snobbery evaluation. Having spent the better part of $2000 in the last month or so on upper end cans, how could a $100 headphone compete? But, I said to myself, in all fairness, you ought to give it another critical listen before assigning it a rank order based solely on perception of price/value.
So, I pulled out both my HD650 and V600 and proceeded to perform A/B switching on the same music passages over and over and over. I have to report that I was astounded at how good they sounded right next to the Senn's. The bass was deep/full/rich, nicely detailed, crisp/clean trebles, and excellent soundstage. After an hour or so of searching for weaknesses and qualities to knock it down, I ended up raising the score to where it actually fit with my testing. I don't appreciate the coiled cable and the headphones were designed for people with bigger noggins than I have; but, sonically, I was and remain impressed. I'm cascading them to my daughter for her IPOD (low impedance is a huge plus!). No way am I getting rid of them although that was the original plan.
So, for the thinner wallets among us, the Sony V600's offer a pretty respectable musical experience. IMO.
Now, I recognize perfectly well that I should be trashing a headphone that costs $100 (soaking wet) compared to these other heavweights, but I'd rather be honest and report what I experienced. Perhaps that does qualify me as insane; but, I'm not being unreasonable. I am completely amenable to being judged incorrect, as well as insane, but PLEASE do an A/B test with your favorite cans before casting that first stone. Don't rely on faded memory. That's what I did, at first, but it would have been unjustified. IMHO.

Actually, I listened to it very recently. It does not change my judgment of that 'phone. It still sounds as bad as I remember it sounding. The lower midrange is severely overboosted on that 'phone - and the rest of the sound, apart from the peaky, colored mid-treble, is buried in mud.

Sounds like crazy talk, perhaps, but it just might be attributable to its relative price/value in relation to headphones, reputed to be the best, that cost anywhere from 3-10 times more. I had to give them another close listen and, even at the risk of being castigated to the Insane Team (would I be its first and only member?), I had to call it like I heard it.

I actually did that same test over the weekend with V600 vs. Senn 595 with iPod->TAH serving as the source/amp. For me the V600 didn't fair nearly as well. Frankly the $35 Sony wraparounds my wife has sounded as good as the V600. Granted I'm not using a great amp/source but they weren't anywhere near the Senns.
That being said, they weren't horrible to listen to. They were the first cans that cost me more than about $40 so I have a fondness for them but I'll likely never listen to them again unless I am desperate .....

The biggest thing that struck me about the V600s was the lack of clarity and detail compared to the Senns pretty much across the board. The bass was stronger in the V600s but there wasn't much definition to it and the high's seemed pretty coarse. I saw the most glaring differences in two songs.
1) Diana Krall/Live in Paris/Just The Way You Are - This song sounds amazing on the Senns and probably plays to some of it's strengths which may make for a biased comparison. The V600s did a reasonable job on the song but there was a lot less detail and it didn't have the same emotion to me. I'd imagine it is something to do with the upper midrange though I'd have to listen again to say why.
2) Metallica/Garage Inc./Whisky In The Jar - This song sounds really muddy on the V600s in the low ranges. To my ears it had the effect of bass just kind of droning on without any real separation between the notes. While hard rock/metal is probably not the 595s biggest strength this song really rocks with them and there is a lot more texture to the song than the V600s let on.
(Sorry for the brief threadjack.....)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
FWIW my current ratings of phones I own all with iPod(lossless)/cardas mini-mini/TAH just to keep it even:
1) Senn 595 = 7.5 - (gotta leave room for improvement, it's still got the stock cable)
2) V600 = 4 - (I see glimmers of potential in a sea of confusion for these cans)
3) iPod buds = 1 - (wow, almost better to just forgo them entirely)
Woody 225s should be here tomorrow. We'll see how the list changes.

2) SR80 - great for portable use when the lack of isolation is not a problem
3) HD25-1 - when I need good isolation 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) AKG K501 - detailed - great for classical
2) Sennheiser HD580 - smoother - better bass - general purpose
3) Beyerdynamic DT990 - very heavy bass - 70s stuff specialists
4=) Sennheiser PX100 - travel and office
4=) Koss Portapros 2
Gone
====
Sennheiser HD535 - most comfy headphones ever

It's not that a $100 headphone can compete with a $450 headphone; it's that I've actually listened to much cheaper headphones (both open and closed) that sound way better than the V600. And I have fairly extensive experience with headphones priced under $150. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I listen primarily to classical and some jazz.
1- Beyerdynamic DT880
2- AKG 501 - needs an amp
3- Sennheiser HD590 with equinox
4- AKG 271 with Zu Mobius
5- Koss K75
6- Sony EX81
7- Sennheiser MX400

I think Eagle_Driver and I have similar tastes in cans.
Here's my list of headphones I have owned, in order of preference
Presently in my possession:
#1- K240S (Great bass presence and extension, liquid-smooth midrange, excellent for rock and any beat-driven music, warms up and fills in thin rock recordings, groovy as hell, and very comfortable)
#2- HD555 (great general use budget cans with a nice flat response)
#3- KSC-75 (king of budget portable phones)
No longer in my possession:
#4- HD580 (returned)
#5- SR125 (recently sold)
#6- DT250-250 (sold) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My choices:
1:UM2
2:HD580
3:K271s/Zu
4:E2C
5:KSC50

3) Sennheiser HD600 (Good soundstage, very detailed, but uninvolving with some music)
4) Ultrasone HFI-650 (Excellent isolation, fun sound, easy to drive)
5) Sharp MS-33 (Excellent isolation, fun sound, easy to drive, slightly "metallic" sounding)
6) Sony Streetstyles (crap)
7) Dell DJ stock earbuds (crappier than crap)
Cans I've owned in the past 3 months:
1) Grado RS-2 (My favorite Grado can, but the highs aggrivate my tennitus(sp?) )
2) Sennheiser HD650 (Good detail, bass seems a bit bloated, more dark sounding than the HD600. Requires a bright/"fun" system to not sound boring.)

I use different headphones with different stuff so I'll rate based on frequency of usage
1. HD 650
2. SR-60 (soon to be replace by a better Grado)
3. HD 595 (A must for DVD!!!)

5. Edifier 800 (my only closed headphone if I ever need one)
6. Senn MX 450 (below average sounding ear bud)
I don't dislike any of my gear except for the last one. All of the above are with stock cables. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. MDR-E888LP
2. MDR-ED268LP
Yeah, I know, neither is "audiophile" grade. But, man, do the E888 sound fantastic on my MP3 player (Nextway NMP-612TD/512). Really nice for Jazz and Classical on it.
I'm considering getting a pair of SA5000s.

I picked up the Koss Plugs as a stopgap measure after I tired of the Sony's well-documented shortcomings and while I was waiting for the E3cs. Even modded, I hated The Plug.
Anyway, it was somewhere around the time that I was waiting for my E3cs to arrive that I discovered Head-Fi. Sorry about my wallet.

2. Beyerdynamic DT770 "Darth Beyers" - flawed but fun.

2. Shure E4 (Got these a month or two ago - still in the ohmygodaretheyawesome-phase  but they're nowhere near the HP-2)
3. Beyerdynamic DT531 (Comfortable, good sound for every imaginable music, not fatiguing at all but still punchy)
4. Koss KSC-35 (Nice sound with no particular flaws, especially for the price, but they hurt my ears after a few hours..  )
5. Sennheiser PX200 (Really bad instrument seperation, good fit, a little isolation, very good portability. Due to the sound, I replaced them with the E4.)
6. Sony CD780 (My first headphones - detailed but they lacked bass quantity and quality, and the midrange seemed sucked out)
7. Beyerdynamic DTX700 (Got these cause I needed cheap headphones with a long cord - they're pretty slow, have a weird accentuation in the lower treble. Nothing to brag about, but an ok value. Using them on my laptop when I can't use my KSC-35 when they start to hurt x_X)

It's been at least three new woodies since my last post, so I reckon it's time for another update. Oooohhh, this may be difficult. Lots of ties, but this time I broke it into categories (sort of).Overall resolution/extension:
1 L3000
2 W2002**
3 HP2*
3 K1000*
3 HD650
6 K340
6 HF1
6 RS2*
9 HD600
10 SR225Tonality/signature/presentation/dynamics (in accordance with my preferences):

4 HP2*
4 HF1
6 W10VTG
7 HD650
8 K1000*
9 SR225
10 HD600How likely I am to pick it up for a listen:
See Tonality rankings above 
-> All grado rankings are with flat or vwap pads
-> K340 is stock
-> W10VTG are still very new so I'm not too sure on the rankings, but I do like them!
-> There are too damn many $$$ headphones that I really like
* -> Been sold
** -> Paired with the HA2002

1) Sennheiser HD650. Just slightly more balanced than the RS-1. There are things that the RS-1 does better, which I'll note below, but overall, if I was only able to keep one of my non-portable headphones, this would be it. Very delicate, acoustic or piano music is magical through these. Smooth and refined.
2) Grado RS-1. The HD650 can't touch it when it comes to blues or jazz. Hard rock/metal are the RS-1's domain as well. The RS-1 does something magical to tubey guitars, especially paired with a good tube amplifier, and it has an impact the HD650 cannot match for harder music. They are extremely brutal on poorly-recorded music or poor-quality digital rips. Painfully so. I was worried about comfort after hearing all the complainers, but when the headband is bent properly, they don't even feel like they're on.
3) Shure E4c. If I could keep only one headphone, this would be it. Incredible treble detail and a good midrange. The bass is very high-quality, though not so high in impact, but that is really OK with me in a canalphone, IEMs with hard-hitting bass are very fatiguing to listen to for me. With an amplifier, they increase in quality even more.
4) Etymotic ER-6. They're very good for the price, extremely accurate and detailed treble and lacks in the bass, though what bass is there is quite accurate as well.
5) Koss KSC-75. I hate to list this at the bottom here but that's where they land. For the price, they sound great! Colored, sure, but very enjoyable sound. They become bass MONSTERS when amped!  .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Sennheiser HD 600 - just about the most perfect thing I have heard
2. Koss KSC-75 - surprisingly great sound out of a small, portable, lightweight package.
3. Sennheiser HD 497 - great, balanced, energetic. Slightly muddy low end. Has a special place in my heart as it was the start of my head-fi journey.
4. Etymotic er-6i - brilliant detail, wonderful isolation. Rather uncomfortable for extended listening. Probably a little too much isolation to be practical in most scenarios where I need little IEMs. Usually use the KSC-75 instead when I need to be portable but don't want to be run over by a car.
5. Sennheiser HD 201 - meh. Rolled-off treble, kind of dark and distant sounding. Comfortable. My headphones of choice for work, where it doesn't leak any sound, and has enough isolation to block out ambient computer noise ,but allows me to hear my coworkers if they speak to me. I can wear these for hours at a time without the discomfort of the more isolating Etymotics. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In one word or less:
1 · Shure E4C - Delicious!
2 · Etymotic Research ER6i - Isolation.
3 · Sony MDR-EX71SL/WK - Decent.
4 · Bose Triports - ;d

Cans @ CasaBildo1. Sennheiser HD-650
Not sure I agree that it's the worlds best, but damn good. Smooth liquid treble, maybe just a little bulbus in the mid-upper bass, a bit rolled off in the deep bass.
2. Beyer DT-880
Maybe a tiny bit brighter than I like anymore, but a smooth and pretty good deep bass.
3. Sennheiser HD-424 (bought new in 1979)
I've always found these a little thin and bright, but very clear and so very comfortable.
4. Rat Shack (Koss) Pro-35
Nice deep bass, a bit grainy in the top, good cheap cans.
5. Sennheiser HD-280
Best deep bass of any can, weak midbass and grainy treble, not as comfortable as the others, but good isolation.
6. Sony MDR-V505 (bought new in 1993)
Very nicely made, folds up, heavy cord. Only problem is that they sound like crap. Thin, not much bass and harsh mids and trebles. Kids have taken these over for games, etc.

Doesn't really like the AKG house sound but isolation and comfort is great (and I got them sooo cheap...)

I feel like a ********* for doing this, but:
1.) HD-650
SR-325i (flats)
2.) Grado SR-80, because they're broken
They're so different, and both so amazing. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

home:
1) HD650:
nothting obviously wrong, smooth, pretty easy on most recorded music. I change to my other headphones when the recording is too thick/blurry too begin with.
2) K501/HF1/MS1:
use them regularly when i want some sparkling highs.
3) K240M/K340:
I use K340 when the recording contains mostly string instruments. other than that, it sounds too honky. Orchestral stings don't suffer much from the honkiness but gain some warm milk coloration which i like.
K240M is a beautiful sounding headphone. It gets limited use due to limited extensions in the high and lows. I really like the midrange of K240M.
portable:
1) KSC35: 10x cheaper than HD650 with 10% reduction in sound quality : ) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Alessandro Music Series One - in touching range of the stratosphere; an amazing value and great synergy with my amp
Sennheiser HD 320 - my old reference cans... recessed midrange, slightly blurry bass and treble-shy, but generally neutral
Koss Sportapro - hide bad recordings well and bury their mistakes, lacking overall detail and refinement - my beater cans

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have enjoyed reading these lists...
Out of my CURRENT headphones.
1. Sony SA5000 - Electronic is my favorite music and the SA5K is easily the best I have heard for that stuff.
2. Sony CD3000 - Rock and Jazz get the older Sony. It is warmer and handles tone better for those genres.
3. Sony XD400 - This is my kick around can; used for movies, games, and as a last resort bad recording headphone.
4. Akg 26P - Portable and my most used headphone. I love it!
5. Sony EX81 - Don't like this one at all! I would sell it but wouldn't wish it on anyone. Run away from this overpriced crap!
Can you tell that maybe I like the Sony sound?

Utterly shocked at this list. It seems very strange that you would list the HP-1 2nd after the 650/zu. Either you like the Grado sound and the HP-1 make you orgasm every time you put them on and you find them clearly superior to the 650, or you dont and theyre way down on your list. I don't know many people who love the Senns AND the Grados, they have a very different sound. Oh well, you learn something new every day I guess.

4. Sony EX71 (destroyed
5. Stock Cowon buds. (destroyed)

7. Cheap Koss clip ons (not the KSC 35/75, destroyed)
8. Two 3rd grade classes playing the recorder on each side of my head (ugh!, remembering old school concerts)
9. Sony V150s ( destroyed intentionally, the...worst...headphones...ever..)
-- edit --
My personal V150 story.
Normally I do tons of research before buying anything that has to do with audio. However, desperate times call for desperate measures. I was on a weekend "visit the family in Vermont" trip, and had no headphones for I left my EX71s and H320 at home. My father had his Ipod mini with him and we share a similar taste in music (he had the iBuds that I knew I didn't like). I figured I would go down to the Wal Mart and pick up some headphones. Looked around, and the V150s caught my eye. Looked at the box, had a low impedence and a wide frequency range, and I figured it would be decent out of an iPod. I was wrong! They sounded terrible ! Really muddy and awful. The best part is I hit financial trouble and my EX71 cable tore to shreds after purchasing them and had to deal with them for 4 months untill I got my A700s. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The ones that have survived:
1.) UE super.fi 5 pro - I am dissapointed that many people dismiss this company, mostly because of their name. Everybody needs to give this company a chance, because they arguably have the best customer support (these days it's Shure vs. UE), and they offer darn good sound at a lower price than pretty much other company can't (Bose is the other way around  ).
2-3.) Sony Fontopia 71 and 81: I first bought these at Circuit City over a course of 2-3 years because I thought: heck, they're expensive and look nice, why not get them? Gah...71's shorted out on me, and the 81's cord split wide open. Disgusting make, and by now I learned that Sony is a very bad company in terms of quality and originality.
4.) Apple iBuds - Oh please, you all know why these are last

Time for an update. I can't believe how far I've come in terms of the headphones I own since I originally made the above post eleven months ago.
1. ATH-W5000 - I actually don't expect to have these on hand until Tuesday, but I'm hoping this is the rank they will achieve in my stable of cans.
2. ATH-AD2000 - I was a Sennheiser guy for about a year until I got these and the ATH-W1000.
3. HD650, HD600, K701, HF-1, ATH-W1000 - Major log jam at this rank. I like 'em all and they all sound different. Of the bunch, HF-1 and ATH-W1000 are receiving the most ear time at the moment. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1 Stax 404
2 Ety ER4S
3 Alessandro MS-1 (when they arrive)
4 Shure E5C 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

fairly simple for me...
1. ATH-A900LTD - Brilliant set of cans, one of the best cans ive ever heard
2. mdr-e888lp - great sounding portable earbuds
3. mdr-g57 (everything is muddy and recessed and they start hurting around your ears if worn for over 10 minutes)
4. stock apple buds - thin and tinny

Based on music enjoyment:

5 and below: Radio Shack and Koss phones
Note my bias for that Japaneese sound...some have said that this is somewhere between a laid back Senn and the forward Grado house sound. I am not sure of that prespective but I like the balance of the Audio-Technica sound.

4) Grado SR 60 (gets my heart pumping while exercising)
5) Sennheiser HD 580 (just pulled these out of the closet a few weeks ago and I'm amazed at how close they are to the 600 series -- a great bargain!)

4) KSC35 -> By far the best bang for the buck
5) KSC75 -> Backup for the KSC35's

1b. Grado HF-1 
-great for a quick pick-me-up, smoother than my old SR-60s, classic rock, alternative, alt country sound good
2. SuperFi 5 Pro
-only used as portables, SQ close to the Senns but mids aren't as good, bass helps with the ambient metro noise the passive noice cancellation does not take care of
3. KSC-35
-super for around the house doing chores, good for excercising or just walking around the block

Here's my entry:

Don't laugh at the KSC-35 being above the DT770. The DT770 is a necessity when I can't use the SR200 (late at nite, etc) So otherwise I'd be using the SR200. The KSC-35 just does portable cans right, period. I'd put the ATH-CM3 as 4) but they are my wife's.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In order of preference, based on sound alone, driven by M3
HD650 (slightly too little treble, a little too much bass, sluggish sounding)
K501 (less bass than i like... but sufficient in many cases, slightly rough treble/thin sounding, seems to distort at high volume)
MS1 (a tad bright, slightly too little bass, slightly uneven mids)
HF1 (strong single note bass, mid slightly scooped out)
K240M (limited frequency extension) = ksc35 (limited frequency extension, little too bassy)
K340 (funny upper midrange/treble, often intolerable)
K240 sextett (extremely limited frequency extension).
Edited: Now that i'm listening to some sacd.... K340 is right up there with HD650. LOL. .. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My list is as follows:
Super.fi 5 Pro - who knew such great sound could come from such a small product!?
Sony MDR7506 - the old standard. durable, fun.
Koss Porta Pro - unbeatable sound at this pricepoint!!
Grado SR60 - not bad for the $, gets uncomfortable after a while though
Shure E4C - good build quality, but shrill sound and analytical 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) AKG K1000 (by far...)
2) very old dt880 (i have no idea if it has anything in common with the newer ones, it s not bad though)
3) Tie between superfi5 pro and pxc250
4)my old sony buds? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

ATH-1000 (bought them today but already by far the best)
Shure E3C (2 years old bought mostly nighttime use and are too loud at lowest ipod volume setting but sound great otherwise/no outside noise)
HD-590 (Used to be my home music/gaming without annoying the wife phones)
Sony EX71 (first upgrade from ipod phones)
KSC35 (great sound 5 years ago with my minidisc player)
HD500 (sounds like music from under a pillow but not bad for gaming I guess)
Ipod Buds (long gone)

What mods, if any, do you hve done to your K340? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

So what headphones are the best after all this?
I can reliably say that I have yet to hear Sennheisers that sound as good (to me) as my new Audio Technica ATH-1000s. The only other phones that I am interested in hearing right now are the AKG 701s or the Beyerdynamic DT 880s. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

A score from 1-10
AKG K240S, modded - 8
Good sound but lower-region bass could be stronger and midbass region lower. Treble and mids after modding are really good. I use it to listen music and computer playing.
Philips SBC-HP840 - 7
Great bass impact and it goes low. Excellent for its price. No real badsides, but doesnt shine anywhere either: Annoying middle-roader.
Cheap and good.
Using it when playing console games and watching movies.
Sennheiser PX100 - 8
Excellent portable headphone. I use them all the time with my portable.
AKG K26P - 5
Dont like this headphone a one bit. Uncomfortable, (hurts my scalp after using it an hour or two) bad sound... Incredible bass impact though, but middlebass drowns everything.
Koss Sporta Pro - 7½
Broken now. Good headphones overall.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Everything IMO!HD-650 + Zu Mobius- Does most everything right. Only lacks the attack & PRAT of the RS-1RS-1- Ultimate headphone when I'm in the mood for it. Does justice to most genres, including most classical.RS-2- Very good sound, and the darkest non-Alessandro Grado. Good bass, and more accurate note decay than the RS-1.SR-325i- Rock only can IMO. Far to bright for most classical & some jazz. Does sound most excellent with older rock recordings, really brings out the detail! Heavy.Etymotic ER-4P- Most neutral "headphone" ever (I have yet to hear a HP series Grado or any electrostats). Sounds very flat and detailed.HD-600/580- Great for the price, but are both lacking something that the HD-650 has. I'll call it mojo Alessandro MS-2- Amazing sound, but not enough bass presence.Modded DT-770- Extremely thumping loud bass, but the sucked out mids ruined it for me.Alessandro MS-1- Always my favorite pick in the <$100 bracket. Very fun sound, never fatiguing.Ultrasone HFI-650- Great sound, bad build quality. Creaky & uncomfortable. "S-Logic" soundstage enhancer must not have been working right, soundstage/positioning less than others in the pricerange.Grado SR-80- Bright, yet fun as heck to listen to. Gets fatiguing quickly.Sennheiser HD-570- My first "high end" headphone. Sounded ok, but extremely hard to drive. Very comfortable & great with games!Bose Triport- Gets bashed way too much around here. Sure, the build quality is lacking & they are overpriced, but they do not sound offensive at all. It's actually my favorite semi-closed can for around ~$100 (Ebay price )Audio Technica A-500- Didn't do it for me. Good soundstage, but not enough detail and the bass seemed weird. I didn't keep them long enough for a better impression..Sharp MD-33- My favorite cheap isolating earbud. Sounds good, yet metallic & has an extremely annoying cable.Sennheiser PX-100- Good comfortable portable can, but a tad too bassy & too expensive considering the amazing Koss KSC series.Koss KSC-75- Great sound for the price! Better than the 35, and sounds even better amped.Koss KSC-35- Like the 75, but with more bass & a tad less detail.Sony Streetstyle- Crap, but they are what I listened to for maaany years.Zalman 5.1 "Surround sound"- Sound absolutely horrible (no bass!!!), and do not offer better soundstage than say, a A-500 or HD-570. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

‘Phones at My Disposal1. K 701 - not as technically competent as the K 1000 and of course not as open; it does achieve a more tolerable sound than the K 1000 with poor records and is always as groovy as the HD 650, but more resolving and more immersive
1. K 1000 - a special headphone with a unique perspective that no other matches (not the R10 nor the HE 90) – also the most resolving of the bunch
2. K 601 - an excellent 'phone but lacks the refinement and "3d textures" of the K 701 (it’s a subtle difference but becomes more apparent with time)
3. HD 650 - very smooth & groovy, but even with the Mobius it cannot top the immersion and conveyance of reality the K 701 achieves (and I’m a long-time HD 650 fan)
4. DT 880 - technically better than the HD 650 in some facets (detail, bass texture) but not as groovy and highlighted flaws rather than exposed detail (opposed to K 701 where the same flaws were heard yet in a more musical fashion and never distracting)
5. HD 600 - slightly more open and sparkly than the HD 650 but not as fun and slightly less resolving; the bass still lacks the detail and texture of the K 701

Neil Pert,
You wrote the following of the MS1:
"Alessandro MS1: a tad bright and tonally lightweight, but it's the best semi-portable open 'phone I've encountered and it lends nearly all genres a fun spin."
What do you mean by "tonally lightweight"?
Thank you.
P.S. I think your drumming is a bit busy.

Since my main listening is Rock music, the Grados always stand out ahead of the rest!  My other cans are used for diferent genres of music, and are all close to one another in time used!

With my current cans the listing would go like this:
1) SA5000
2) HD650 + G52
3) RS-2
----
4) PX100
I listen to a lot of rock music also so SA5000 is naturally in first position. HD650 + G52 goes well with almost every other genre (SA5000 does also) and RS-2 is nice to have for some rock tracks and for its fun factor. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In techicality, I still own these heaphones. However, some are not in operating order....
1. Grado SR40 /w MDR v300 pads
- I got these for quite a steal at $40 canadian, considering how much Grados retail up here. The pads on it where yellow at some point at time but turned a dingey brown. I replaced them with v300 pads which sounded considerably better in terms of clarity, bass and overall comfort. Unfortunately I killed them in an ill-fated driver transplant.
2. Sennheiser HD437 /w XD200 pads
- I bought these and where immediately disgusted at how uncomfortable they where. So I took the pads off my previous pair of headphones, a set of MDR-XD200's, added some padding around the circumfurence of the HD's cups and crammed them on. They now feel 100x better and have a better soundstage without any sacrifice in SQ. I'm still using them. On a side note, the pads vibrate like crazy when the volume is set high and there is heavy bass.
3. JVC HA-V560
- They sounded really good and I still remember them as being one hell of a set of headphones. Neutral, comfortable, fantastic! That was until one of the drivers stopped working due to a faulty volume control knob which I promptly "fixed". Eventually a hinge broke and I had to use epoxy to fix that. Then it disappeared into my sister's bedroom where they subsequently lost their cups. These things really where sensitve to my computer's poor sound card at the time and tended to be somewhat staticky. Still, good headphones.
4. Sony MDR-XD200
-Bought after I got it's younger brother the XD100, which was the only headphone I ever returned. It required massive amounts of eq'ing to sound right. It's currently being used for spare parts.
5. Sony MDR-V300 /w JVC heaband
-Bright, bright, bright and given to me for free. Originally, they where only the drivers and their enclosures, but I used a headbad from my JVCs, along with massive amounts of duct tape, to get it to fit right. They felt like medieval torture devices. Currently, the cable is being used as a spare part. Drivers are still OK.
The rest aren't even worth mentioning.

1. Philips HP890 - A great allrounder and non-fatiguing, can wear for hours on end.
2. Shure E2C - Good isolation, only had these a few weeks but they're getting better every time I listen to them.
3. Koss KSC50 - Although ranked behind the other two I love their sound, in comparision they make the E2C sound a little lifeless.
4. Koss The Plug - Beh, even though the E2Cs cost 3x as much it's worth every penny. Rubbish except for the bass. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Group I - the perfect headphone
- none -
Group II - Really nice cans, even if they require some EQ here and there
HD590
HD540 (not necessarily worse in all aspects - e.g. soundstage depth - , but more practical)
Group III - Technically not as competent by far, but fun to listen to
HD420 SL
Group IV - Basically competent cans with somewhat strange sonic signatures and some mod requirements here and there
SHP805 (quite usable after EQ/mod)
HD535 (have yet to try the last EQ, but those have always managed to disappoint me fairly quickly)
Group V - OK, but not exceptional
HD424 (a tad bright sounding with yet less bass than the '420SL, but quite listenable overall; still above earbud level, but the oldschool microphonic steel cable is annoying)
DT231 (where's my upper midrange, and can I have these in less bright and more efficient?)
K26P (actually sounds pretty good on a noisy bus, but don't try these @home!)
HD497 (one of the most "closed" sounds I've heard from an open headphone, and with a sucked-out upper midrange and sibilance peak and not so great highs at that)
Group VI - Yikes
HD430 (can you say "BRIGHT"? - a pity, 'cos they look good, are decently comfy and technically quite competent)
MDR-101 (cheap piece o' crap)

Well, if we're talking just about where I would rank them in terms of MY listening preference only (not whether I think they are more or less accurate, neutral, etc.), then the ranking wouldn't change, even without the Headphile mods. For me personally, the Sennheisers, good as they are, just do not have enough bass. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yes, with respect to your listening preference, where would unmodded versions of the cans fit in your ranking list? For example, would you rank the unmodded HF-1 below the Headphile HD650? Your list currently holds 12 headphones. I'd like to see it expanded to 16 by including the unmodded versions.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

New listThis is ferraro, back from a self-imposed ban. Doubt any of you remember me (but I hope some do, as pathetic as I am, heh), but I left because I wrote some stupid crap that I felt was embarassing. Since then, the "need" to post at this forum has become too strong, so I signed up again. I have gotten permission from a mod to use this new account.
Anyway, my list of favorite headphones has changed since I last posted in this thread. [All of this is just my opinion]
The KSC-35s are now my favorites ahead of either the HD-595s or the SR225s. This is regardless of price. Why? Well, because the HD-595s and SR225s both have severely flawed sonic balances. The HD-595s are muffled beyond what is acceptable (however, if I move the headphones out and away from my head a bit, the veil disappears - it is as if the HD-595s are closed cans), the SR225s lack any kind of bass presence on most tracks (there is no lower-end body to the sound, basically... it feels detached from the ground, wayyy too light), and neither have very good soundstages (why the HD-595s are recommended for gaming is beyond me - my KSC-35s are at least as good for gaming, soundstage and all). The only problems the KSC-35s have are slightly boomy bass and somewhat harsh highs.
Now, I can fix the problems of either of my more expensive cans with eq'ing, but should I have to do that with cans that are supposedly solid performers at the ~$180 level? No - more should be expected out of them. The much less expensive KSC-35s need no eq'ing, and thus are the better cans, regardless of price.
1. Koss KSC-35 (overall rating: 6.2/10)
2. Grado SR225 (overall rating: 4.3/10)
3. Sennheiser HD-595 (overall rating: 3.7/10)
4. Sennheiser MX-400 (overall rating: 3/10)
Now, I know that a good amp (I currently have a Xenos 0HA-R, little portable amp) would improve my more expensive cans a bit, but I don't feel like spending more money on what I consider to be flawed cans. However, I might get some flat pads for the SR225s, though I think the pads are overpriced.
I am not trying to be "cool" by liking cheap headphones - after all these hundreds of hours of listening to all of my headphones, I have come to dislike the unbalanced sound signatures of both the HD-595s and the SR225s, while finding no glaring faults with the KSC-35s.
Update: Hah, "this is ferraro," like I have some kind of reputation here. Anyway... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I never got around to doing this ..Spacing represents distance on the scale.
1) Ultrasone HFI-650
2) Grado HF-1
[AKG k271S would go here, very close behind the HF-1, if I still owned it]
3) Koss KSC-75
[HD-555 would go here]
4) AKG k26P and Koss the Plug
The HF-1's sound is superior to the HFI-650, but that infamously peaky upper range fatigues me very quickly. Plus, the HFI-650's are sealed, which is very useful in my home. The KSC-75's sound very similar to a pair of Grado's. I'd wager that they'd give an SR-60 or even an -80 or -125 a run for its money. The k26P (which just arrived today, and I'm unsure as to where they are in the burn-in process) is extremely bass-heavy and the highs are almost nonexistent, but they're very comfortable and offer excellent isolation for such a small headphone. The Plugs have a more balanced yet papery sound, but don't isolate, and isolation is important to me.
Will be edited when we see where the k501 stacks up in a week or so ..

Resurrecting this thread (that I think should be stickied).
Re-ranking my headphones now that I have another addition. This time, I felt like ranking my headphones in various categories.TREBLE

2. Sennheiser HD-595

The HD-595s have a somewhat muffled, and just plain odd, sound signature. I don't have enough knowledge/experience/of an ability to explain in what ways their sound signature is odd.
The K 81 DJs have the most natural and balanced sound signature to me. They are my favorite cans despite their narrow, flat soundstage, their inability to separate instruments in busy passages (but they are not that much worse than the top 2 in that category), and their somewhat unrefined bass.

Nope......It's too hot to wear them in public. And too big. 
Ikrit42 comfortable question? 
At first they feel like new Senns.....lots of pressure on the temple and ear area.
But they are way more comfortable than my Grado's.

For me, they are super-comfortable, and sometimes I find myself half-asleep with them on

I know it doesnt touch the temples....It just feels like its putting lots of pressure around that area.  Am a little picky and its hard for me to get used to new things.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My list:1) Audiotechnica A900: I have these modded with blu-tac and removed the DADS system. With all that, they have no real sound weaknesses to speak of. Great soundstage and rich sound, with a nice bass and fantastic isolation. Their only major flaws are that they're big and so require a bit of a commitment to wear (not very casual) and can get pretty hot around the ears, so I sometimes prefer using other headphones during the summertime. These are great for when I need isolation (like when traveling) and have a one-of-a-kind soundstage compared to my other headphones. They're like a perfect mix between smooth and bright and have quite the extended bass so I hear a lot of bass guitar that I don't hear at all with other headphones. And of course, the sound quality is what my other headphones wish they had. If only they could be used portably. . .
2) Sennheiser MX400: I really like these things. The thing I was looking for most was a pair of portable (read: PORTABLE) headphones that I wouldn't feel I was missing anything listening to (for example, I'd be okay having these as my only headphones during a trip.) These do just that. They remind me a lot of the PX100 though with a lot less bass (this is fixable - see below) and a slightly less refined sound. However, they're very fun to listen to and render all of my music, regardless of genre, respectfully. The bass, while not great as with most earbuds, is kind of punchy and tight, and the sound is very smooth and pleasantly coloured. The iPod's bass boost makes these better IMO (one of the only headphones for which it does that), so that's the setting I listen to these with. Anyway, these are absolutely perfect for portable use since they're more than decent enough, and I can have them on me at all times, all without leaking excess noise. I used to have the Apple earbuds in place of these, but these beat them out by a longshot (as do the MX300), not necessarily for detail (though I think the mx400 do) but for enjoyable listening. The Apple ones render the music in a dull and flat sort of way.
3) Sennheiser PX100: Very laid back and pleasantly coloured, with a fun thumping bass. They're pretty portable too and probably the most comfortable of all my headphones, with a very airy and non-fatiguing sound that's good to just relax with. I use them all the time for games/movie watching for their comfort and huge bass. They sound veiled compared to my higher quality phones, but this works out great for night time listening and certain other things (I don't know why, but I love listening to Boards of Canada with these more than any others I own.) This was my first love in the realm of higher quality headphones and I still use it quite a bit.
4) Grado SR60: So involving and fun to listen to. Rock never sounded better than with these. Their major flaw for me though is that they can be fatiguing, especially at louder volumes which, IMO, are necessary to bring out the fun sound I love about them. So it's kind of like a catch 22. Their comfort is okay since I bent the headband. Sometimes, when I feel like really rocking out, that's when I use these. I have them fitted with reversed 414 pads, where the hole exposes the entire driver. While the sound was less bright with the stock comfies, the difference in sound quality between them was too big to keep using them.
5) Apple 71s: That is, apple in-ears with Sony EX71 tips. They sound fairly good (miles better than the EX71) and are ultra portable in addition to isolating a bit. The sound signature is pretty similar to the Apple buds, but improve on them. The microphonics are a drag for walking though, especially when it's windy outside, and they sound very closed, which isn't really a flaw considering I think most IEMs / half IEMs sound like that, but I just like an open sound better. Their strengths are their clarity and punchy bass. When I need isolation on the go, these come into play.
6) Sony D66 "Eggos": Their sound quality is pretty good, I'd say better than the PX100. The bass is okay since I put a small hole in the plastic membrane to increase it (see the BowerR64 mod.) With that, the overall sound is actually quite similar to the SR60s, but with a little less and worse sounding bass. They have a glaring flaw though, and that's their portability, or lack thereof. They're too big to put in your pocket, you can't put them around your neck, and they're not good enough for home use (beaten out by the SR60 for rocking and A900 for quality / smoothness) so they're in sixth. I sometimes use them for walks though, especially when it's cold. For all intents and purposes though, they're my brother's headphones now.
7) Sennheiser MX300: These came with my Rio Karma. Slightly less detailed than the Apple earbuds and their 400 cousins, they nonetheless are more fun and smooth to listen to than the Apples.
8) Apple Earbuds: With the MX400 replacing these, they're useless. However, overall they're all THAT bad and I can see why so many people keep using these, even taking the fashion factor out.
9) Sony EX71: Well, there's a lot of bass, which can make some music fun to listen to. Overall though, the sound is somewhat muddy and - I don't know how else to put this - doesn't sound natural. The build quality is horrendous (the rubber cord is about as durable as bubble gum.) I don't use these at all anymore as the Apple 71s have taken their place. The cord did have the advantage of minimizing microphonics, but it wasn't worth it.
In terms of sound quality alone, I'd rank them (not including EX71, since I don't like their sound period):
A900----SR60-Eggos--PX100--Apple 71s--MX400--MX300=Apple Buds
[edit] I've edited this post a hundred times now, but I think I've finally gotten my preferences down.  So unless a very nice sounding, comfortable, non-sound leaking, PORTABLE headphone comes around sometime, I doubt I'll be buying any more of this stuff, unless to replace them. Thanks for the help Head-Fi!

Moved up the SR225s to tie with the K 81 DJs.
After listening to them again for a while, I have rediscovered that the SR225s are great cans, with a fun, dynamic, and clear sound signature. They are obviously way ahead of the K 81 DJs in terms of detail, speed, soundstage (mostly because the K 81 DJs soundstage is just about the worst I have ever heard, TBH - but I like the SR225s "no-nonsense" soundstage), airiness, instrument separation, and bass quality. Unlike the K 81 DJs (and every other set of cans I own), they seem to never sound muddy, no matter how much is going on, and even when instrument separation starts to get lost a bit. I bet the SR225s will be alone at the top of my ranking soon enough.

Oh, to be clear, my rankings are in tiers. Within tiers, the order is kind of random. Though a lot of the time (e.g., 010 being at the top, K 1000 being at the top of its tier, E4c beating E5c) it's not entirely random. But I'd put SR-X over HP1000 if I took the time to decide rankings in tiers.
So yeah, I do prefer the E4c over the E5c though. There are more than a few of us here. But that's more a sonic preference, both are good in many ways, both are flawed in many ways.
Heh, I just beat Julius mode, and have started on Hard on Castlevania DS. Great game. Sounds awesome with the KSC-35.

Have some fun with Boss Rush, it can get a bit crazy at times 
Been through Normal 5 times, Hard mode 3 times, both Julius mode characters and Soma up to Lv99, and an awful lot of time spent in-game *is hooked*
I like the sound of the game on my re-cabled SportaPros tho, the bass does quite a bit with the RPG blast  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Right now I rank the Senn HD600s as my favorite, The Etymotics get the most use though, follwed by the AKG K701s, then the Grado SR-225s.

Sennheiser HD-650
Sony MDR SA-5000
Westone UM2

Time for another update:
1) AKG K501
2) Audio-Technica W5000
3) Stax SR-X Mk3
4) AKG K701 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I've been trying to decide between HD650, SA5000, and K701.  I made a spreadsheet in which I kept track of the preferences among these three, so every time somebody in this thread said that they prefer the 650 over the 701, for instance, I put down a 1 and every time somebody said that they prefer the 701 over the 650 I put down a -1. I also did this to compare SA5000 with K701 and HD650 with SA5000. I found that about 65% of 17 people prefer HD650 over SA5000, about 63% of 8 people prefer K701 over HD 650, and 80% of five people prefer K701 over SA5000.
Based on this, it seems that people here that have more than one of these phones will typically find K701 to be their favorite of the three. My upgrade-itis just got worse! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

From what I heard and agree with (being that I have the K701) is that the K701 is like an Ety, but w/ headphone qualities, such as wide (WIDE!) soundstage, better extension up and down, etc.

The 595s are preferred over the Grados on a rare track or two and in one surprising place. When I play my electric guitar and use headphones in the amp I prefer the Senns. I way prefer the Grados for rock music but the senns sound better out of my amp when I play guitar (even with heavy distortion). Go figure.

1)Etymotic ER-4p: just right, I made an adapter to convert them to ER-4s, but I don't use it with my portable players.
2)Sony MDR-7509: A little bass-heavy, but they do seem to reproduce very low frequencies and aren't too attenuated in the high frequencies
3)Sony MDR CD-750: Not in the same class as the two above. Decent though.

3) DT531

5) E5
6) KSC75 (soon to be recabled and have 75-ohm series resistors added)
7) HD201 (though amazing sound, considering it's a closed headphone for less than $20 which I will actually listen to voluntarily  And it really doesn't sound that much worse than the KSC75)

I also own KSC75's that I prefer between the DT770's and SR225's but maybe I'm just blinded by the amazing performance/price ratio :P
Have some UM2's on the way to throw into the mix.

I don't know where to place the UM2's as they are a whole different animal and not really able to compare to the rest. I didn't have an amp for my first K701's but have since aquired a GL/DPS so I have another pair on the way to try out 
Loving my RS-1's though

Very muddy, poor detail in mids and highs. Definately the winner in the category 'worst value for price'. Build quality was terrific though, but looks don't do the trick in the end. If it would sell for $100 at most, I'd see it as a great IEM, otherwise no. IEM are in the end very overpriced imo, compared to the performance done by full sized phones.

I use the KSC-75's the most as portable phones. At home the Beyers are usually my first choice, but some days I just need the Grado sound. the Ety's are used most when traveling, or when isolation is needed. Some nights I just crave the detail of the Ety's. All have their place and are great phones.

It's been awhile since I tried this. These represent my listening preferences, based on headphones I currently own. If I don't mention one that I own, it's pretty far down on my listening list. Tier 1 is what I feel to be the best of the best. Tier 2 are reference quality headphones, but IMO don't reach the level of performance of Tier 1 to my ears. Tier 3 can be reference quality in many systems, but again IMO is not capable of the overall performance of Tier 1, and may have some sonic characteristics that affect my evaluation, but still may rank among my favorite headphones.

My listOkay, I think I'll just clean this up a bit since I don't really see myself coming back to this forum again (that's right, I'm completely and utterly satisfied with my equipment for the first time ever!) So here's my list:1) V-Moda Vibes: Great sound, nice bass without overpowering everything else, some isolation. My portable headphone of choice, and thus the one I use most often. This is the first really portable headphone I've had that I'm really satisfied with, sound-wise. I use these with my iPod shuffle (2nd gen), which is the perfect combination since it allows me to have my music with me at all times without even feeling like I'm wearing any gear at all.2) Audio-Technica A900s: Excellent sound, huge bass, huge sound-stage. The best headphone I own, sound-wise. I have these modded with blu-tac, so any complaints you hear about these regarding recessed mids are taken care of, and I took out the DADS system, which resulted in a bit less bass (not missed since theres still a huge amount), but a much better sounding bass. I still love these things. Their only fault is just how huge they are.3) Sennheiser PX100: Old faithful, these were my first good quality headphones. I have the old version, and use these for things like watching movies, playing games, etc. So comfy and they have good bass. It's also distinctive bass - it sounds seperate from everything else, which is unusual, but great. A bit too veiled for my taste when it comes to listening to music, but it's very dark, smooth, and mellow, perfect for listening before going to sleep.4) Sennheiser MX400: They're not top of the line in sound, but these are so consistent. They have a perfect sound signature and sound good with all music, and for cheap earbuds, they beat out most in bass. Comfy as well.5) Sony D66 "Eggos": Basically, they're like the SR60 but with less bass, and some passive isolation. The Bower64 "hole in the membrane" mod is in place here, which raised the bass level beyond it's very minimalistic beginning. There is a catch 22 though - they're designed for portable use, but asides from when you're wearing them, they're too clunky and huge to carry around with you, and choke you if you try wearing them around your neck. Still, I have good memories with these (my second phones after PX100) and they're comfortable and have a really neat design. They are good for wearing outside during the winter! These are on basically permanent loan to my brother, who loves them.6) Grado SR60: These are very exciting headphones, great for rock music - I mean, they are beyond comparison in that genre. Just very fun to listen to. But they're also bright - oh so bright. Part of the reason (well, a huge part) is that I have these modded with reversed 414 pads with a hole in them (the classic SR60 mod.) Not very comfortable either. Overall, exciting, fun, but not for long periods of listening.7) Sony EX71: These are silver modded to begin with, which has drastically changed their sound for the better. I thought I didn't like them, but I kind of do now. They have a large amount of bass, and are a bit fuzzy / not quite up their in audio fidelity, but they're fun to listen to. I use these for when I need some extra isolation. The bad news: the cable is utter crap, and falls apart. I have a large portion of it covered in electrical tape now.
I don't currently use or plan on using any of the headphones from this point on.8) Bose Triport IEs: Ughh, I wish I didn't buy these now. It's not that they're bad - they sound very good (second only to the Vibes - which actually beat them without much trouble - in terms of earbuds that I've tried) and are very comfortable. However, the highs are lacking; the buds are too mellow, in other words. Not great for rock or for getting you excited / tapping your toes, etc. Also not good for portable use since the tips fall off very very easily (I keep my phones under my top layer of clothing, so the friction does that to them.) In other words, not too bad, but I have no reason to use them anymore.9) Sony EX90: They're decent, have some punchy bass, slightly isolating (about on level with the Vibes, and definitely less than the EX71s.) However, their sound is on the thin side. I don't like that. These can lay claim, at least, to being the most firmly stuck in your ears of all my headphones. They won't fall out once you put them in, that's for sure. I can mod these with seran wrap (it takes lots of effort to do it the perfect way though) so that the sound becomes rich and full, and the bass starts thumping. However, this both looks bad, feels not all that comfortable, and most importantly, slips out of my ears and loses the seal if I even move my jaw to smile.10) "Apple 71s": Apple In-Ears with EX71 tips (the supplied Apple tips are worthless, and I'm not even exagerrating.) These sound pretty good, punchy bass, clearer sound than the EX71s. However, they too much of an "in your head" sound (probably because they weren't designed to be inserted deep into your ears) and huge microphonics. Still, it was a nice discovery. I have better phones to use now though, so these are stowed away doing nothing.11) New Apple buds: These are the redesigned Apple iPod buds. They are very comparable to the MX400, only a bit worse, particularly in bass. That's it. I am pretty impressed by Apple though. I wouldn't deride anybody wearing these things instead of upgrading for the pack-ins - these aren't bad.12) Sennheiser MX300: Worse than the 400, basically. Much less bass and a less refined sound. Somewhat comparable to the old Apple buds, though I think these are still a bit better, and more importantly, they have that Sennheiser smoothness to them.13) Old Apple buds: Here they are, the old iPod pack-ins. I mean, they're not horrible - they beat out many headphones that will actually cost you money, don't have any hissing in and of themselves, you can still enjoy your music quite easily with these, etc. However, they do nothing to really impress. You can listen to these, but you'd be missing out.
Yup, that's all. Thanks for all the recommendations and advice through my stay here, since I think, after spending way more money than I should have, I have what I want. Goodbye!OLD OPINIONS - I don't have the heart to delete all this info. Some of it may still be of use, afterall.EDIT: Blarghh, ignore all this. I think I have a habit of deciding how much I like a headphone too soon. As of this moment, my portable headphone of choice is my Senn MX400 because they're the only portable phones I have that are perfectly balanced and don't have any noticeable faults.
Hmmm, if people are posting updates, I might as well post this:
1) Bose Triport IEs: My favourite portable, and thus most used, headphone. See my review.
[edit] Not my favourite any more. So, so good is so many categories, but the highs are recessed, making it too mellow for rock music, and the tips keep falling off when I wear them and getting lost.
2) Audiotechnica A900: I have these modded with blu-tac and removed the DADS system. With all that, they have no real sound weaknesses to speak of. Great soundstage and rich sound, with a nice bass and fantastic isolation. Their only major flaws are that they're big and so require a bit of a commitment to wear (not very casual) and can get pretty hot around the ears, so I sometimes prefer using other headphones during the summertime. These are great for when I need isolation (like when traveling) and have a one-of-a-kind soundstage compared to my other headphones. They're like a perfect mix between smooth and bright and have quite the extended bass so I hear a lot of bass guitar that I don't hear at all with other headphones. And of course, the sound quality is what my other headphones wish they had. If only they could be used portably. . .
3) Sony EX90: My portable headphones when I need isolation. With the cling-wrap mod, the sound quality is quite nice and well balanced. The bass in particular is excellent with the mod, and the overall sound is very dark, just how I like it. It gives some nice isolation (enough for day-to-day stuff, like walking around outside) and, NO MICROPHONICS! The comfort is what you'd expect of the EX line (I use the small tips myself) and they look great (well, not with the mod - it looks exactly like what you'd imagine it would.) The build quality is a good step up from the EX71 as well (thicker cord that feels less rubbery, similar to a stock iPod phone, but less rigid.) They don't leak enough sound to be a bother to anyone, not anymore than a regular earbud anyway. So in other words, it provides good sound, some isolation with no microphonics, and comfort. My only problem is that the seal can come out kind of easily, even just by smiling! By the way, without the cling wrap mod, the sound is a little thin, as is the bass, and is not all that well balanced.
4) Sennheiser PX100: Very laid back and pleasantly coloured, with a fun thumping bass. They're pretty portable too and probably the most comfortable of all my headphones, with a very airy and non-fatiguing sound that's good to just relax with. I use them all the time for games/movie watching for their comfort and huge bass. They sound veiled compared to my higher quality phones, but this works out great for night time listening and certain other things (I don't know why, but I love listening to Boards of Canada with these more than any others I own.) This was my first love in the realm of higher quality headphones and I still use it quite a bit, mostly for TV/gaming.
5) Sennheiser MX400: I really like these things. They remind me a lot of the PX100 though with a lot less bass (this is fixable - see below) and a slightly less refined sound. However, they're very fun to listen to and render all of my music, regardless of genre, respectfully. The bass, while not great as with most earbuds, is kind of punchy and tight, and the sound is very smooth and pleasantly coloured. The iPod's bass boost makes these better IMO (one of the only headphones for which it does that), so that's the setting I listen to these with. Anyway, these are absolutely perfect for portable use since they're more than decent enough, and I can have them on me at all times, all without leaking excess noise. I used to have the (old) Apple earbuds in place of these, but these beat them out by a longshot (as do the MX300), not necessarily for detail (though I think the mx400 do) but for enjoyable listening. The Apple ones render the music in a dull and flat sort of way. The EX90 has replaced these as my portable headphone of choice, but I still have fond memories of these.
6) Grado SR60: So involving and fun to listen to. Rock never sounded better than with these. Their major flaw for me though is that they can be fatiguing, especially at louder volumes which, IMO, are necessary to bring out the fun sound I love about them. So it's kind of like a catch 22. Their comfort is okay since I bent the headband. Sometimes, when I feel like really rocking out, that's when I use these. I have them fitted with reversed 414 pads, where the hole exposes the entire driver. While the sound was less bright with the stock comfies, the difference in sound quality between them was too big to keep using them.
7) Apple 71s: That is, apple in-ears with Sony EX71 tips. They sound fairly good (miles better than the EX71) and are ultra portable in addition to isolating a bit. The sound signature is pretty similar to the Apple buds, but improve on them. The microphonics are a drag for walking though, especially when it's windy outside, and they sound very closed, which isn't really a flaw considering I think most IEMs / half IEMs sound like that, but I just like an open sound better. Their strengths are their clarity and punchy bass. When I need isolation on the go, these come into play.
8) Sony D66 "Eggos": Their sound quality is pretty good, I'd say better than the PX100. The bass is okay since I put a small hole in the plastic membrane to increase it (see the BowerR64 mod.) With that, the overall sound is actually quite similar to the SR60s, but with a little less and worse sounding bass. They have a glaring flaw though, and that's their portability, or lack thereof. They're too big to put in your pocket, you can't put them around your neck, and they're not good enough for home use (beaten out by the SR60 for rocking and A900 for quality / smoothness) so they're in sixth. I sometimes use them for walks though, especially when it's cold. For all intents and purposes though, they're my brother's headphones now.
9) NEW Apple Earbuds: Yes, there is a difference. The sound very similar to the Sennheiser MX400 in terms of quality, but they differ in the amount of bass (where it is handily beaten), and it offers a brighter, clearer sound to MX400's smoother sound (which quality you prefer is entirely up to you.) A good step up from the old stock iPod buds, I'm glad that more people, who would just keep using the stock ones, have a good pair to start off with now.
10) Sennheiser MX300: These came with my Rio Karma. Slightly less detailed than the Apple earbuds and their 400 cousins, they nonetheless are more fun and smooth to listen to than the Apples.
11) Apple Earbuds: With the MX400 replacing these, they're useless. However, overall they're all THAT bad and I can see why so many people keep using these, even taking the fashion factor out.
12) Sony EX71: Well, there's a lot of bass, which can make some music fun to listen to. Overall though, the sound is somewhat muddy and - I don't know how else to put this - doesn't sound natural. The build quality is horrendous (the rubber cord is about as durable as bubble gum.) I don't use these at all anymore as the Apple 71s have taken their place. The cord did have the advantage of minimizing microphonics, but it wasn't worth it.
In terms of sound quality alone, I'd rank them (not including EX71, since I don't like their sound period):
A900----Triport IE-SR60-Eggos--PX100-EX90--Apple 71s--MX400--MX300=Apple Buds
PX100 is kind of odd in this case, since although the quality is excellent, I'm not a big fan of it's huge veil for regular music listening, so consider that.
-----------------------------
After all this time, I think I've finally gotten my preferences down.  I've got myself the perfect portable (Triport IE and EX90) and home (A900) headphones now, with some other ones to fill minor roles, both for convenience (PX100 with games / TV) and variety (SR60, if I'm so inclined.) Thanks for all the help Head-Fi!

Nice to see there is someone else out there liking their HP-DX1000....
How are they compared to the L3000?
1) JVC HP-DX1000 (extremely good in ambiance, detail and bass)
2) Sennheiser HD650 (balanced: finally alive)
3) Grado SR325i (with mods: Liberators with extra damping material & rubber damping ring: way past RS1, getting amazingly close to PS1...)
4) Beyer DT880 (2003: still some of the best phone around)

HD600. I've heard and owned others but this is the only one I can live with. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The top three from what I own now:
1) Grado RS-1. Still the king 
2) Ultrasone PROline 750. Takes a while to get into, but completely disappears and just lets the music flow after 10 or so minutes. Great bass, very detailed, yet never shrill highs. The mids are decent, but seem to lack a tiny bit of realism. Amazing soundstage with certain recordings. A great headphone for the money.
3) beyerdynamic DT-880 (new version). Good for acoustical music, but that's about it IMO. Highs seem to be a bit bright with poorly recorded material, bass is still a bit lacking (considering it was bumped up from the previous version according to Headroom). Mids are sterile. Still, a fairly balanced headphone, and it's very comfy.

In order preference:
1: Grado SR 325i. Great cans for (IMO) every type of music, classical included
2: Grado SR 80. Fun cans, a little too bright, though.
3: Sony MDR 81EXL. Nice In Ear Phones, lacks soundstage and highs.
4: Grado SR 40. Don't listen to these much, since I prefer the 325i.
5. AKG 240-DF. Now these were my very first HiFi cans, bought in 1988 I think and I was thrilled then. Today compared to the Grados they sound very dull and extremely flat.

OK, now I think I have enough info to break the ties:
1) Audio-Technica L3000
2) Sony Qualia 010 w/ Black Dragon OR Wyvern Audio cable

4) Grado HP2 w/ JGUWBRC

If I were to acquire an R10 (meaning: sayonara, #4-#8 ), then it would be in a tie with the L3000 for top spot - BUT I'd clearly prefer each of these 2 headphones for very different genres. The L3000 is king for rock, and that would win me over if I had to choose between the two.

Some of these aren't getting any time at all right now. My SR-40 has a broken wire and needs repair. I made a long term trade of my EW9 for the ES7, so I haven't heard that headphone in a while. I'm getting a pair of Proline 750s shortly and am curious to see how they rank.

Behold, my collection of redundant portables!
From crap to greatness:
7.)Creative HQ-1300
Just, ew. Stay away. Horrible.
6.)Pioneer SE-450
Clamp tighter than K81DJs, distort like mad and screech out painful highs. I paid three bucks though, so yeah.
5.)Koss: the Plug
My first canalphones. It was a real novelty having bass in an earplug. Alright value at ten bucks.
4.)Koss UR-40
Sort of okay sound but muffled and lacking in detail. You'll miss half the music but the parts you do catch sound alright. Comfy too.
3.)Senny CX300
Accurate, not too pricy. just a nice set of canalphones to have with you on the go. Look downright classy.
2.)Senny PMX100
These would be great if I didn't live in the noisiest appartment in town. The added 'M' in 'PMX' means they're streetstyle, which in turn means they're wildly uncomfortable.
1.)AKG K81DJ
See the official 1400-post thread. They live up to the hype.

I prefer the iM716 for a number of reasons, mainly for the isolation and portability with little compromise on sound. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

for 99 here we go..1. DT880 Headphiled with BlackGold - soundstage and tight bass makes me come back every time
2. HD600 stock - love depth to the bass, heard with a diff aftermarket cable at TO meet, but cannot say that I was that impressed to buy one. Soundstage cannot touch my Beyers, nor is there that interminably fun top end... but I likes them, I really likes them.
3. UM2, great bus drivers, underground and walking. The cable is hardly microphonic, great bass, but hiss like the devil. In fact my M-Audio has audible noise with these things! Great overall if not for the hiss.
4. Koss pro4aa - I feel like quite a collector with these on, or even just in the house, for nostalgia yes, not for fun, since it is much like a brick on the head.
5. Koss PortaPro - The bass kick is unrivaled anywhere I have heard. Fun fun fun.
6. Koss KSC 75 - Much the same without the hair-pulling band, but not as boomy; good love.
7. Senn CX300 (S) - Very fun, but don't get the feeling like I am really getting what I payed for them. Nice extension down and up though for the cheapness of the look.
8. EP630 - Look rubbish and for that reason, fall below the Senns. Cannot hear difference, but the straight cord is not my favourite as well... just ugly little triangle on the side.
9. iBud - quite surprisingly for an included bud, my favourite yet and that included my Sharp AUVI DR7, DS8, DS77 etc...
10. Senn mx400 - I head exactly the same as the ibud, but at least it is black and the fit is not as painful.
11. Senn mx500 and 550 - Waste of money, cost 39$ here in Canada. Waste of money

Bold are the one's that I still have:Grado RS-1 -- So much detail, enthusiasm, and smoothness in a single headphone that this is just the best I've heard so far.
AKG K-340 -- Beautiful midrange, great defined bass, lovely non-fatuiging highs. Stupidly sold. 
Grado SR-325i -- It's a Grado, can't go wrong there. Bit skewed towards treble but still a highly entertaining and enjoyable headphone. Sold in favor of the RS-1.Beyer Dynamic DT770/600 -- The bass! Great soundstage and enormous sound, a fat, sloppy, heavy sound that's great with electronica.
Shure E4c -- Very nice sounding IEM! I wouldn't have sold it if I hadn't stopped using public transport.
Audio Technica ATH-A700 -- Good headphone but the DT770 did everything this one did better, for my uses (electronica) anyways.
Sennheiser HD-595 -- My first headphone. Good, but not my thing. Too held back for my tastes.
Sennheiser HD-580 -- Same as the HD-595, too held back. Great with classical music though!
Now what I'm really interested in is where the K-1000 will end up in that list. I don't expect it to be better than the RS-1 but I've been wrong before.

The HF1 is clearly the Anakin of all the woodie Grados. Warmer and more sloppy, less detail resolving than either of its Reference Series - masters. In fact... the Grado Council does not grant the HF1 the rank of "Reference Series"... its too warm and too seductively enjoyable... "Path to the dark side that is...".

Guess it's time for an update since I've acquired a few more pairs. Ranked in order of my personal preference (my ranking of them technically would change it up a bit):
1) Headphile Grado SR225 w Zeta Flat Port C-Pads
*Honorable mention to HD595 which would have tied @ #1 if I still had them.
2) AKG K271S w Headphile cable
3) Senn HD 600
4) Westone UM1 - soon to be replaced by Grado SR60 which will take over this spot.
5) AKG K26P

The HD595 can sound a little sterile at times. It also gets congested in certain passages of music. The HD595 is easily the better headphone in all respects, but the HD485 is just more fun to listen to. I ranked it higher on my personal scale because I enjoy them more. While they work with many types of music reasonably well, they wouldn't be my first choice for anything. So that's why they've fallen out of use and out of favor with me.

1b. DIY Headphones (sounds great but uncomfortable)
2. AKG K701 (stock)
3. Senn HD650 (veiled because some frequencies have been "deleted" by Senn)
4. Shure E4c (lacks sub-bass)
5. Koss UR40

5. Bunch of generic Philips, Sony, Koss and buds.
I have the DT880/-03 coming, and I believe it will match my warm SOHA pretty well, thus, will become my no1...

Ranking based on amping them with RSA "M" Hornet:
1 - Sennheiser HD650 (stock cable)
2 - Sennheiser HD595
3 - Grado SR-60 (modded with metal grills and no dots)
4 - Sennheiser HD485
5 - Sennheiser PX-100
6 - AKG K81DJ (defoamed and blu-tack modded but still too much lowbass, not for me)
7 - Ibuds 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Well, I'll rank these based on what get's listened to most:
1. Stax Sigma non-pro
2. Stax Lambda Professional
Okay, so I'm new to this hobby! Both are listened to via a Stax SRM1 MKII 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.0 / AKG K701 ~stock cable
1.1 / Senn HD650 ~Moon Audio Silver Dragon
1.2 / Senn HD650 ~Cardas
1.3 / beyerdynamic DT880 ~stock
5.0 / Senn 595 ~stock / gaming cans
6.0 / Senn HD540 Ovation II ~Cardas
Among the first four there is no clear winner imo, just depends on the source recording and my mood at the time.
The 595s coupled with the DeskTop amp and a coax feed make the XBox 360 console gaming experience very realistic to my ears.
The 540s are old but very comfortable and non-fatiguing with any 2ch or multichannel source. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Got a new toy, and took a little time to re-evaluate my phones with somewhat surprising results:
1) DT931 (Stock w/ added impedance)
2) F5005EB (Modded W5000, extra bass variant)
3) DT931 (Stock)
4) DT801 (Modded)
5) F5005 (Modded W5000)
6) F5000 (Modded W5000)
7) DT801 (Stock)
8) W5000 (Stock) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

DT931's eh? I figure they've got to be pretty good, considering how good the 831's sound. Are you using the standard 120ohms added impedance, or even more? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I used some 100 ohm resistors I had in my parts bin, connected to the jack and plug with alligator clips. 
I took measurements on both, and the stock DT931 has a ruler flat frequency response from around 40Hz (below is rolled off a bit) up until about 4KHz, when it gets a little rough but not much. With the added impedance, it gives about a 3-4dB boost on the bass, and 1.5-3dB boost on the midrange, with it decreasing as the frequency goes up.
These things sound absolutely phenominal, it's brighter than my normal preference, but somehow it doesn't bother me in the least. Probably because the treble response is so even. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

This is how I rank them. I go back and forth between Ety and the HD580's for first place.

Neither price nor comfort are factored in these rankings; just sound.1. AKG K701: does most everything close to "right" for me; a little bit bright without being harsh or overly colored, nice head-stage, good detail, great instrument separation, decent overall tonal accuracy (apparently; I wouldn't know due to a lack of much real-life music experience), a balanced amount of bass, and finally, a sense of "realness" to the sound that is difficult for me to explain.2. Etymotic ER-4P: insanely detailed, it gives everything on a recording, it is just about perfectly balanced, and being isolated from the outside world allows for a great experience, but the ER-4P has a distinct "this is just a recording" sound - I just about never feel like I'm listening to something real - that is possibly due to its unique decay.3. AKG K501: nicely balanced, but a bit redundant given that I have the K701, and the head stage is more distant-sounding than it should be for a lot of recordings.4. Koss KSC-35: the only places I feel it really fails are in bass quantity (too much) and quality (too undifferentiated and bloated).5. Grado SR-225: too bright, but very good at drum sets.6. Sennheiser HD-595: a potentially amazing headphone utterly ruined by a muffled sound (to my ears, of course).7. AKG K81DJ: decent isolation, but nothing about the sound is anything special and it has too much bass.8. Sennheiser MX-400: it sounds horrible like most (all?) ear-buds.
Sometime this year I will have a better DAC (probably a Zhaolu D2.5), sound card (an X-Fi, which can output without re-sampling, unlike the Audigy 2), and amp (Heed CanAmp), which could switch around some of these rankings. I'm curious to see if the HD-595 will "clear up" with a stronger amp, for instance.

I don't have the K-1000 anymore despite the fact that it is still my favorite headphone to date. I just don't have the budget to properly source and drive it, and I sold it because of money issues, so I am using the SA-5000, which I like quite a lot as well. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

The ER-4P has officially moved to way down to 5th place, just ahead of the HD-595. I cannot stand the lack of sense of "realness" to this IEM. A recording is always a recording. I am not going to be using the ER-4P much from now on. Ahead of the HD-595 because of the ER-4P's high detail.

I don't believe in headphone driver burn-in beyond about an hour. I am a big believer in earpad wear-in though, and the DT931s I have are extremely soft and well worn-in on the pads.

So Ultrasones come defective out of the box? Thanks for the heads-up, I hadn't really known much about them but I guess I don't need to check them out in the future.

I can't rank them. I like and listen to them all for different reasons, moods, music. Are my K1000s better than my HD580s? Yes, but I don't much care when I'm enjoying myself. 
So, in order of purchase, last to first:
MS1
K1000
Darth Beyers
HD650
Headphile K340
ER4P
SR60 (boss made me sell them to him)
HD580 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I am still convinced that my Ultimate Ears Ue-10 PRO are the best headphones I have heard. The Sennheiser HD 650 is great with my RSA Emmeline HR-2, but the AKG K 701 is turning out to be superior indeed. The HD 650 are dark, warm, and bass heavy while the K 701 are light, airy, and balanced.

Not much love for Ety's I see. Not sure how someone can prefer the MX400 or the KSC 75 to the ER-4P/S. I've heard those and they don't come anywhere near. My guess is they are just too analytical for some?
For me:
HD600 - Still the most listenable for me.
Ety ER4P - Better detail than HD600. Great presentation but no air to speak of. Get's better with every listen
------
MS1 - Still great phone, very enjoyable. Not much use anymore though
KSC 75 - Excellent for the money
MD33 - Pretty muddy but very fun to listen to on the go
JVC Marshmallows - Didn't get much use yet. They are acceptable at best from what I've heard thus far though
MX500 - Ok for certain situations. Horrible for trains

Don't get me wrong, I love the Ety more than the Koss and MS1 but cannot wear them for long as my ear canals are too easily irritated by true IEMs. If I had custon molds it'd be a different line-up. I have ranked them on what I enjoy and can actually use. One day my Etys will have custom molds and I can get back to using them.

2) DT 770 PRO 250 ohm

I have three phones and each is decidely different from the others. I switch a great deal depending on the source material and the amp being used. So in a manner of speaking, all three are favs. All listening is done at home, no portability issues to be considered.
In no particular order, although the AKGs(most recent purchase of the three) are getting more and more use as time goes by. Love their crisp detail, not to mention versatility and comfort. They are often trumpeted as best suited for classical and jazz, but I love them with everything.

List would differ I had a more conventional taste, DT880 would be #1 then. But the DT880's clinical Triphop & Ambient performance leads to devaluation.

My ears are easily irritated as well and for me, custom molds are by far WORSE (or at least the molds on my UE10's are which have been redone twice).

2.Audio-Technica A700

These are rankings of how often I use them, not how good I think they are. I use the MS1s most because I love rock, and after getting used to the MS1s, the midrange just seems too recessed with the 700s. The 700s are great for gaming, jazz, classical, and well just about anything that has a lot of dynamic range and requires a nice quiet background 
The HJE50s were/are more well received than the MDR-EX51s, but I prefer the 51s. The HJE50s are too harsh and muddy too me. The 51s sounded a lot more smooth when I had them.. but then again it was my first ever IEMs so part of it may be attributed to the 'wow' factor.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My mind has changed again. Another list.
1. AKG K701 - a severely flawed headphone (thin, un-musical, utterly un-dynamic), but I still like it the most out of my collection
2. Sennheiser HD-595 - definitely still find the sound "muffled," but the headphone is more dynamic, less thin, and more musical than the K701... a good alternative for when I get sick of the K701
3. Grado SR225 - too colored
4. AKG K501 - the utter lack of involvement hurts this headphone the most - however, it is as good with jazz as everyone says
5. Koss KSC-35 - un-refined with too much bass of low quality
6. Etymotic ER-4P - just about never sounds "real" to me
7. AKG K81DJ - wholly unremarkable headphone with too much bass of the "closed-headphone" variety
8. Sennheiser MX-400 - total crap, like all earbuds 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Okay, I think I'll just clean this up a bit since I don't really see myself coming back to this forum again (that's right, I'm completely and utterly satisfied with my equipment for the first time ever! I've said it before, but this time I mean it!) So here's my list, without too much detail:1) V-Moda Vibes: Great sound, nice bass without overpowering everything else, some isolation. My portable headphone of choice, and thus the one I use most often. This is the first really portable headphone I've had that I'm really satisfied with, sound-wise. I use these with my iPod shuffle (2nd gen), which is the perfect combination since it allows me to have my music with me at all times without even feeling like I'm wearing any gear at all.2) Audio-Technica A900s: Excellent sound, huge bass, huge sound-stage. The best headphone I own, sound-wise. I have these modded with blu-tac, so any complaints you hear about these regarding recessed mids are taken care of, and I took out the DADS system, which resulted in a bit less bass (not missed since theres still a huge amount), but a much better sounding bass. I still love these things. Their only fault is just how huge they are.3) Sennheiser PX100: Old faithful, these were my first good quality headphones. I have the old version, and use these for things like watching movies, playing games, etc. So comfy and they have good bass. It's also distinctive bass - it sounds seperate from everything else, which is unusual, but great. A bit too veiled for my taste when it comes to listening to music, but it's very dark, smooth, and mellow, perfect for listening before going to sleep.4) Sennheiser MX400: They're not top of the line in sound, but these are so consistent. They have a perfect sound signature and sound good with all music, and for cheap earbuds, they beat out most in bass. Comfy as well.5) Sony D66 "Eggos": Basically, they're like the SR60 but with less bass, and some passive isolation. The Bower64 "hole in the membrane" mod is in place here, which raised the bass level beyond it's very minimalistic beginning. There is a catch 22 though - they're designed for portable use, but asides from when you're wearing them, they're too clunky and huge to carry around with you, and choke you if you try wearing them around your neck. Still, I have good memories with these (my second phones after PX100) and they're comfortable and have a really neat design. They are good for wearing outside during the winter! These are on basically permanent loan to my brother, who loves them.6) Grado SR60: These are very exciting headphones, great for rock music - I mean, they are beyond comparison in that genre. Just very fun to listen to. But they're also bright - oh so bright. Part of the reason (well, a huge part) is that I have these modded with reversed 414 pads with a hole in them (the classic SR60 mod.) Not very comfortable either. Overall, exciting, fun, but not for long periods of listening.7) Sony EX71: These are silver modded to begin with, which has drastically changed their sound for the better. I thought I didn't like them, but I kind of do now. They have a large amount of bass, and are a bit fuzzy / not quite up their in audio fidelity, but they're fun to listen to. I use these for when I need some extra isolation. The bad news: the cable is utter crap, and falls apart. I have a large portion of it covered in electrical tape now.
I don't currently use or plan on using any of the headphones from this point on.8) Bose Triport IEs: Ughh, I wish I didn't buy these now. It's not that they're bad - they sound very good (second only to the Vibes - which actually beat them without much trouble - in terms of earbuds that I've tried) and are very comfortable. However, the highs are lacking; the buds are too mellow, in other words. Not great for rock or for getting you excited / tapping your toes, etc. Also not good for portable use since the tips fall off very very easily (I keep my phones under my top layer of clothing, so the friction does that to them.) In other words, not too bad, but I have no reason to use them anymore.9) Sony EX90: They're decent, have some punchy bass, slightly isolating (about on level with the Vibes, and definitely less than the EX71s.) However, their sound is on the thin side. I don't like that. These can lay claim, at least, to being the most firmly stuck in your ears of all my headphones. They won't fall out once you put them in, that's for sure. I can mod these with seran wrap (it takes lots of effort to do it the perfect way though) so that the sound becomes rich and full, and the bass starts thumping. However, this both looks bad, feels not all that comfortable, and most importantly, slips out of my ears and loses the seal if I even move my jaw to smile.10) "Apple 71s": Apple In-Ears with EX71 tips (the supplied Apple tips are worthless, and I'm not even exagerrating.) These sound pretty good, punchy bass, clearer sound than the EX71s. However, they too much of an "in your head" sound (probably because they weren't designed to be inserted deep into your ears) and huge microphonics. Still, it was a nice discovery. I have better phones to use now though, so these are stowed away doing nothing.11) New Apple buds: These are the redesigned Apple iPod buds. They are very comparable to the MX400, only a bit worse, particularly in bass. That's it. I am pretty impressed by Apple though. I wouldn't deride anybody wearing these things instead of upgrading for the pack-ins - these aren't bad.12) Sennheiser MX300: Worse than the 400, basically. Much less bass and a less refined sound. Somewhat comparable to the old Apple buds, though I think these are still a bit better, and more importantly, they have that Sennheiser smoothness to them.13) Old Apple buds: Here they are, the old iPod pack-ins. I mean, they're not horrible - they beat out many headphones that will actually cost you money, don't have any hissing in and of themselves, you can still enjoy your music quite easily with these, etc. However, they do nothing to really impress. You can listen to these, but you'd be missing out.
Yup, that's all. Thanks for all the recommendations and advice through my stay here, since I think, after spending way more money than I should have, I have what I want. Goodbye!

At the moment -
Sennheiser HD555s - my first good headphones, and I love them to death. I doubt I'll part with them for a long time, even if I do end up upgrading.
Icemat Siberia headset - Sounded okay, but built like crap and basically fell apart. They where decent, but not worth the $60 I paid for them.
Koss Plugs - My current portable 'phones. Not horrible, but nothing special either. Shoulda gotten marshmallows instead, but I knew very little at the time.
Apple iBuds (old) - I hate them with a passion. They need to die.
Soon (Like, tuesday):

V-Moda Vibes (probably ahead of Siberias, but I haven't heard them yet, so I dunno)

5. Koss KSC-35 - un-refined with too much bass of low quality
6. Etymotic ER-4P - just about never sounds "real" to me
7. AKG K81DJ - wholly unremarkable headphone with too much bass of the "closed-headphone" variety
8. Sennheiser MX-400 - total crap, like all earbuds

This is a hard question since I like both of my headphones, but:
1. Sennheiser HD580/Cardas
2. Sennheiser HD595/Stock
While I love my HD595 headphones for their neutrality and amazing sense of depth, the HD580's are more fun to listen to because they offer more airy presence and they have fuller bass than the HD595's. But the order would be reversed if my 580's had the stock cable on them, since the 580's are inferior headphones IMHO to the 595's with the stock cable.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Since my opinion changes a lot on some of the headphones I own, I can no longer keep using the pure ranking system without it being inaccurate soon after I post it. Thus, I have categorized my headphones in another way.
Headphones which I just about never hate, even though they have tons of flaws:AKG K701 (thin, sibilant, un-euphonic, with horrible reproduction of cymbals and the like, but it is still my favorite)
Headphones about which I have a generally positive opinion, but do not think of as "the best I have:"Grado SR-225 (too bright)AKG K501 (too distant for many recordings)
Headphones with flaws that frequently tend to get in the way of my enjoyment of them:Sennheiser HD-595 (muffled sound)Etymotic ER-4P (most recordings sound too much like recordings)
Headphones that are just "decent:"Koss KSC-35 (un-refined, too much boomy bass)AKG K81DJ (wholly unremarkable, too much bass)
Headphones that are not good enough for me to listen to:Sennheiser MX 400 (ear-buds are crap)

1. ATH-W5000 - I actually don't expect to have these on hand until Tuesday, but I'm hoping this is the rank they will achieve in my stable of cans.
2. ATH-AD2000 - I was a Sennheiser guy for about a year until I got these and the ATH-W1000.
3. HD650, HD600, K701, HF-1, ATH-W1000 - Major log jam at this rank. I like 'em all and they all sound different. Of the bunch, HF-1 and ATH-W1000 are receiving the most ear time at the moment.


Another update (a year after posting v2 above):
1. RS-1 - I've basically come a full circle, it seems, as I started the audiophile path with the SR60 a few years ago. The sound is very engaging, fun, smooth mids, incredible bass impact with awesome details (drums sound so real) and excellent treble details. I just got 'em last week so maybe it's the new toy factor. In any case, the RS-1 is the king right now.
2a. ATH-W5000, ATH-AD2000 - I tried rotating the pads but I just can't get the fit I want with the W5000. I like the way the W1000 fits my head. I'll fiddle some more.
2b. HD600, HF-1, DT990, ATH-W1000 - HF-1 didn't sound very good with my home setup, so I brought it back to the office. However, with the RS-1 in town, the HF-1 isn't getting much ear time.
I seem to like 'em all, so it's really difficult to rank these.

Wow.... you put your IEM ER-4P in front of your Open HD580s? I have the Shure E4c, which I have heard is similar in SQ to the ER-4P, and they are no where near my 580s. Are my Shures defective or what???
How does everyone else stack their IEMs vs. Full-Size phones?

I'm thinking about getting the Beyer DT770 or the Senn 25 soon b/c my Shure's are so disappointing compared to my 580s. I don't think you can compare Full-Size to IEMs.... can you??? Please correct me if im wrong!!! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I dont think he was ranking them based on SQ. Unelss of course he just prefers the sound of the IEMs over the 580s. The er4s dont have as much bass and he might like that. The lack of isolation is also kinda annoying ive found. Right now im sitting burning up in my room with the window closed so I dont hear the street noise with my 580s. If i were wearing IEMs i would hear just silence.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Rankings with best and worst attributes of each headphone.
1. AKG K701. Best: somehow "real" sound, despite flaws. Worst: obviously inaccurate representation of sibilance and poor SQ in that general frequency range.AKG K501. Best: nicely balanced sound. Worst: low-quality bass.Etymotic ER-4P. Best: an insane amount of detail. Worst: sounds very fake above a low listening volume.
4. Grado SR-225. Best: dynamic sound; great at drums. Worst: too colored, too bright.
5.Sennheiser HD-595. Best: an involving, musical listen. Worst: too muffled.Koss KSC-35. Best: almost as good as any of my higher-ranked headphones at a much lower price. Worst: bloated bass.
7. AKG K81DJ. Best: it blocks some outside noise, at least. Worst: nothing above average about this headphone; horribly exaggerated, bloated, crappy bass.
8. Sennheiser MX-400. Best: nothing. Worst: everything.

The ties at 3 and 6 are irresoluble because in both cases it's apples and oranges, i.e. headphones that excel at very different things. I've also got some AKG K240 Sextett and Realistic Pro 30 orthos on the way, but I expect I'll just give them to friends or sell them. I'm thinking of narrowing to five and one better in-ear, though I may also make one more move up the electrostat foodchain.

Well, I put them tied at no. 5, and oddly enough I actually thought of you as I did that. Remember I'm using an almost stock K340 (well, I was, my new one has some tweaks) and yes, I do underamp them about half the time, namely when they're at the office and not at home. But truth be told, maybe I bumped up the MB out of sympathy for floats in general. As I think about it now, maybe I'll go back and edit that to be a little more honest. It's not like the K340 really trails the A250 when it comes right down to it.
A tip to people with old electrets like the K340: I sold my last pair of K340 a while ago and just grabbed a new one today. I nearly spat out my coffee when I plugged them in because they sounded so awful; dark and muddy. Then I remembered the guy said he hadn't used them in years and I decided to let them run in a bit before making any decisions. Sure enough, after I set them aside for an hour at high volume, they sounded fine.

hehe, no need to change your ranking on acount of me. I can understand the float sympathy though. They are few and far between on here.

Hi Thermionic! And welcome to Head-Fi! With a name like that, you MUST be a tube guy! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hi F107plus5, thanks for the welcome and it's nice to be here!
Actually, I first need to say a big thank you to everyone here for such an interesting and informative site. Expensive though, as I have been spending money ever since I found the site again a couple of weeks ago!
Yes with my name I am indeed tube inclined, though my tubes are mostly fairly old and historic (if you have a long memory; Quad 11, Leak Stereo 20 etc) though the Stax SRM is perhaps ‘only’ 10 years old…

No; I'm afraid not a very long memory. I don't remember much about tubes before about 1947 while staring at those beautiful creatures in my Dads Hallicrafters rig! The memory must have been in the winter because I remember how warm the receiver was and how comfortable it felt. In the 50s I used to help keep our stuff running by having my Mom run me to the drugstore with a bag full of tubes so I could use the tube checker. Then in the 60s in the Navy I worked on tons of tube stuff, and then more stuff into the early 70s. After that? Nothing! Nothing at all!
But I've got to rectify that(Flemming valve? No pun intended!)by getting at least one tube amp for my cans! I have been without tubes for entirely too long! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Ah I see that your memory is indeed long, it’s just that my oldest bottles are from the 1960’s.
Yes I do like tubes, they seem to have interesting qualities and also I suppose that in my formative years they were to be found in the best audio equipment. And when I had saved a few pennies I bought a used QUAD amp. That was in 1967, and I still use the power amps to this day (with most of the original tubes). Naturally over the years I tried and used a few SS amps, but when ever I dug the old QUAD out to see if it still worked I ended up putting it right back into the system. You see it simply just sounds ’real’ and like you are sitting in front of real musicians (yes I do go to concerts). The small Leak gives a similar effect though to a lesser extent, and both amps are of course re-built with new components and a few minor tweaks as required. The Stax/SRM combination is also (to my ageing ears) rather good, and I bought that after I discovered the Orpheus system at a Hi-Fi show…
Now that I am avidly working my way through this fascinating site; that new portable Millett hybrid looks very interesting, it might be just the thing for my Grado 125s. Trouble is that I have just bought a MiniBox E, so I think I will wait until the Mk 2 version comes along perhaps.
Sorry if I have strayed off topic a bit.

I would not have ranked 2-4 in this order a month ago, but having done some critical listening with my new Corda Move amp, I surprisingly find I like the KSC75 better than the CX300 and PX100. CX300 is really a different animal that should be compared (and ranked below in sound) the ER4P, but the CX300 and KSC75 is a real head to head battle. The KSC75 wins on sound and comfort, though I know some folks don't like the clip ons.
HD580 on the way, so it will be interesting to see how it plays against the Etys.

This is only the ones I still have - in order of sound only.
I can't live without the first 2, but wouldn't want to part with any in the top 9-10.
1) Shure E500PTH (SE530) - probably a tie with HD600, one has to be number 2 though 
2) Sennheiser HD600 w/650 cable - tied with E500PTH for enjoyment, but better soundstage, leaks too much sound when I want to blast!
3) Ultrasone HFI700 DVD - good imaging with movies and live music
4) Denon AH-C700 - very close to the Ultrasone but without the soundstage
5) Beyerdynamic DT231 - they seem to be the best under $100 phones
6) iGrado - tied with PX100, faster bass, brighter highs but harsh at times.
7) Sennheiser PX100 (PMX100) - highs not as good as the DT231, but bass is, highs not harsh
8) Etymotic ER6i - good detail, needs bass and the right amp fixes that, small enough to sleep in comfortably.
9) Bose Quiet Comfort QC2 - sometimes we need quiet without in the ear phones, more detail than triport OE.
10) Bose triport OE - a little bass heavy, smooth sound, lacks detail but fun/okay for non-critical listening.
11) Sennheiser CX300 - nice highs and lows but poor detail - too cheap to sell (not worth the time)
12) Ultrasone iCans - will be for sale now
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SE310 and E4c and Super.fi 5 pro that I've sold would rank right after
#5 and better than #7 - somewhere between the two. The Bose IE would
be better than #12, the E2c would be better than #11

So you think the Livewires are better than your 750's SQ wise or are they just more convienient?
I was planning on buying a used pair of DT880's and I wasn't sure if the Livewires bested full-size phones which could influence me to buy them in the future (In addition to the 880's).
Anyway:

3) UE Super.fi 3 Studio and Senn MX75 Sport Earbud (Super.fi 3 - fuller, smoother, and more natural sounding bass and midrange, isolation; Senn MX 75 - better dynamics, more air, more detail, and better highs)

IDK. The HD201's didnt sound very good at first but after I recabled them they were a completely different set of cans. The A130 for some reason I find way to bright and harsh. Its excellent for details and definitely the best movie phone out of all the ones I have but I can't stand to listen music for more than 2hrs straight with them.

Everything below 5 is out the door if I ever get around to it, to make room for a few options missing at the top. If I still had a K340 or a PMB100, it would be in that gap between 3 and 4. A QP85 would be tied for 5th. If I still had a DT990, it would be in the gap between 5 and 6. If I still had a K400 or DT531, it would be in the gap between 7 and 8. And to be fair I haven't actually had a chance to test the YH-100 up against the Stax since my latest tweaks/improvements.

It isn't the music-- the YH-100, once properly damped, can handle anything with aplomb except maybe for bad recordings. It loves the kind of cuts that other headphones can't do right. I'd be satisfied with it if I could only have one headphone, as I would with any of my top three. I've never heard a conventional dynamic headphone that can match it.

Grado sells a good number of cans for $200 and under (if you haggle, you can get the SR-225 for under two bills. The SR-125 is only $150 and the SR-60 and SR-80 are both $100 and below.
Also, I just bought a pair of Beyerdynamics DT-770 Pro for $185 after tax at Guitar Center. (Last pair they had in the store!) I think these cans are great value for the money, although unlike the Grados, the DT-770 Pro needs an amp. It sounds "okay" coming from an iPod, but through Yamaha RXV850 they sound like proper rock.

Ok, after listening to my A130's for the past month since my HD201's have been out of commission I noticed how much better they are. I also recabled my HD201 just for fun and it changed the sound and now its more detailed and bright. I definitely don't like them now compared to how they were before, IDK what I changed to change the sound that much. So for now I have to revise my list. A130's still havent been recabled or blue-tak'ed so they still sound a bit harsh imo.

the k530 is just an updated K301, a pretty poor headphone in relation to the 401 or 501, no comparison really. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Well, I didn’t listen to the 401 or 501, but the 530 was not that bad in my opinion. Solid, but not good. I decided to spend more money to buy the HD-650 at the end of this year. They only get good reviews and I think I’ll like them. Might need a better amp next year though.

Oh, yes, I think you've got them at the right point in the rankings. I also think it's safe to say the HD-650 will be taking your top spot in the new year. You're right, though: now you're on the slippery slope, and the amp upgrade comes next.

Having just collected some of headphones from various boxes I shipped back to myself from Germany a few months ago, time for a new ranking of what I've got on hand. My amp and source have improved since my last post.
1. Stax SR-X III
2. Yamaha YH-100 (modded)
3. Koss A250
4. Realistic Pro 30 (modded)
5. Altec im716
6. JBL Reference 220
I've had or have dozens of others, including such popular and cult favorites as the K340 (3 times!), DT990 (old version), QP95, QP85, PMB100, K240 Sextett, K400, and DT531, and not one of these would rank above 3rd on this list. My old SR-5 would probably tie for 2nd. Now, direct your eyes up a few posts to krmathis' listing. My number one is his number six and last. And I don't think he's wrong about it. There's still room to move up. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

2. Sony MDR-V500DJ (My first Headphone, not so bad)

4. Prodipe Pro 550 (is it an headphone? really?)

I really wouldn't have guessed at this a few weeks ago, but here's my updated rating.
1) Sennheiser HD650 push-pull out of the Dared monoblocks.
*BIG GAP*
2) Sennheiser HD600 push-pull out of the selfsame monoblocks.
*BIG GAP*
3) My old stock bass-light K340 out of MG Head.
(SR-404 would go here but it's sold)
4) Westone ES2.
5) Single-ended HD600.
*pretty big gap*
6) Stax SR-003 out of SRM-313.
7) A900. Lowest on the list of my good headphones but it's still fun to listen to.
The UM2, E500, single-ended HD650, A250, and DT770 I don't care to rank. They all suck.
I don't have an amp that can drive the K1k to its potential now, so I'm leaving that off my list. I would guess that it would go in the #3 spot just ahead of the K340.
I can't really rate the H2. It is amazing at some things but completely fails at other things. I really can't place it properly, since I am either not driving it properly, or it still needs more tweaking and isn't ready to be rated just yet.

Hah, yeah. The SR-001 is a wonderful-sounding little thing, isn't it? How do you wear it? I found that wearing it off the headband just shoving the earpieces into the ears hurts like hell after a while, and wearing it on the headband hurts a bit less. But, by bending out the headband to reduce the pressure, and then just letting the earpieces rest on the ears but not inserting them deep into the ear canals makes them much more wearable. I used the larger sized tips when doing that. Bass suffered a bit but on the whole it still sounded very good.
Now, to get that sound in a bigger package, you'll have to go straight to the O2, or balanced HD650. The Lambda line sounds completely different and won't really cut it (though it's pretty good in its own right).

Yeah... they're great. I wear them with the headband because otherwise they feel like they'll fall out. The only part that actually causes pain is the housing. it pushes on the edge around the "bowl" part of my ear. I think I'm screwed.

I had this problem as well. Try to move them around and make sure you inserted them into the headband housing correctly. With some fiddling I was able to find a great way to position these HPs and can use them for 2 hours straight with almost no discomfort.

Not much  Mini^3 and the built-in amp on my DAC. Either way, I doubt there is a chance of the treble going coming around to wear I want it. It's way too recessed for my tastes. They're great for games/movies though. I'm keeping them until I get a nicer amp (couple weeks hopefully) and if I still don't like them, they're gone.

I've tried so many things  It's just the circular housing is larger than the little cavity place of my ear and it rests on the outside edge on the lobe and hurts like HELL! I've had a lot of advice concerning different tips but it's not the tips or ear canal that hurts.. just the lobe where the driver sits  I'm selling and saving up for a full size Stax system so this hurts me in two ways

Bose Triport 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I usually don't spend over $100 on a pair of headphones. Ranked in order of sound quality and price.
1. Bose TriPort In-Ear "rev. 2" ( Bose headphones - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia )
Very good bass, might be lagging in the high's but some tuning on the sony nwz-s615F does the trick. Best comfort I've ever felt, could listen for hours and my ears won't hurt. Not to mention customer support is excellent also.
2. Sony MDR-EX71
First pair of headphones I got for over $30, relatively expensive according to me at that time. Fairly good comfort for canal's, great bass (requires some tuning) but later something got screwed up in left side of earpiece so it's basically broken.
3. Sony MDR-Q22 & 23
I just needed some headphones that didn't hurt my ears so bad compared to the stock earbuds that came with DAP's and CD players. Bought these back a long time ago when I wasn't so crazy about clear and good sounding bass.
I'm not quite an audiophile yet, but i'm getting there though . 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Bose IE's (v1)

i'll note that the margin is slim and I would say they are ~ equal if you use the bose tips. I use ep630 tips with the bose and they deliver the bass better.

The AKG wins out on account of its more natural, faster and transparent sound. The HD 650 by comparison is bass heavy and darkish in coloration.

have already done own or owned. will now include listened to a fair amount, by tier in no order.Tier 1
- HE90 (the best ever?)
- R10 (huge sound stage, great detail, perfect for classical)
- O2 (the 650s of stats - slightly dark in tone and laid back, but very engaging)
- 1.2B (a bit forward but great definition and bass)
- L3000 (smooth sound, great tone, nice controlled bass)
- HP1000 (cleanest sound you will hear from a dynamic, speaker like L/R presentation)
- HD650 (balanced and with the right amp, these are just about as good as it gets)Tier 2
- HE60 (a fun headphone, just not in the same league as its big brother)
- K701 (large sound stage and good sonics from top to bottom)
- RS1 (warm, intimate, full bodied - perfect for jazz)
- HD600 (a clear somewhat forward sound)
- DX1000 (smooth and fluid sound, large sound stage - bit colored in the mids)
- K340 (very clean sound w/ good body - needs the right amp since hard to drive)Tier 3
- K1000 (2 small speakers attached to the side of your head - but i prefer HP)
- HD580 (a slight step down from the 600)
- RS2 (similar to RS1 but i'll take the larger wooden enclosures/greater resonance)
- SR325 (woodied, sounds very close to the RS1/2 but not as refined)
- HF1 (has the standard upfront, punchy grado sound)
- DT880 '03 (great highs and good speed, but too bright at times)
- DT880 '05 (same as above except better bass on this model)
- K501 (has a nice airy quality, but is also thin and bass shy)
- W100 (a nice warm sound, but colored like most of ATH headphones)
- W5000 (very good detail, decent sound stage, but bass is light and has a treble spike)
- GS1000 (spacious, yet bass is too prevalent and mids too recessed)
- Lower End Stax (slightly thin and unmusical)
- HD595 (good for ipods not an audiophile headphone)Other
- PS1 (have not heard)
- 010 (have not heard)
- 4070 (have not heard)
- AD2000 (heard only briefly - just recall liking my RS1s more)
- D5000 (initial impressions were not good)
- Ed.9 (seemed too isolating and too bass heavy)

Well, it's not an objective rating. YH-1 has a lot of shortcomings, but there is something about the midrange that just makes it sooooo smooth and involving for me. It's very flat, accurate and at the same time punchy and is great for rock. All in all it's a great companion to my Lambdas. That's why it's in that top spot in such esteemed company.

Time for an update. Just the ones I have here now (i.e., not my Sextett or HOK80-2, which are in storage in Berlin).

5. Realistic Pro30 (modded)
6. Altec im716 (depodded)
7. AKG K240M
Of the other headphones I've had, none would rise as high as 3. The SR-5, K340, A250, QP85, QP95, DT990 and possibly Sextett would fit between 3 and 5. K400, DT531, HOK80-2, A130, and ESP6 would fit between 5 and 6. At around 7 I'd put the K260, HD560II, HD540, QP55x, SR-60, and maybe a couple of others I'm forgetting. Finally, the KSC-75, Ref 220, OVC T25, HD201, and a few others would fit in at the end, all good in their way, but as you can imagine not worth keeping around with the other gear I have and have had.
edit: the more I listen, the more I have to put the PMB500 at the same rung as the SR-Lambda. It's actually better than the Lambda for much of my music.

From best to poorest :

2) AKG K240S
3) Sennheiser HD600
4) Sony MDR-7509 (sold some time ago)
5) Sennheiser HD270
6) Sony MDR-7506
I'll maybe buy myself some DT990-2005 or DT880 next. Beyer Dynamics seems to make the best headphones IMHO. Maybe some DT250 too, if the imbalance problem is fixed at the company.

After longer listening I have moved the Stax up a notch or two. This makes me more interested in later Stax headphones, interesting. This Stax still lacks a bit of bass impact but EQ can take a little of this sting away.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Well, the O2 has arrived. So, that changes things somewhat.
New ranking:
1) SR-007 MkII
2) HD650 balanced
3) HD600 balanced
4) K340
5) ES2
6) HD600 SE
7) HD650 SE
No ranking for the H2 or K1000 yet, I still can't drive them right. I think the K1k will rank in at #3 (i.e. between HD650 and HD600 balanced), while the H2 could potentially be #1 if its problems were sorted out. But it's not that great as it stands. The SR-001 has been busted for a while so I can't rank it based on memory.
Don't care to rate all of my other gear - UM2, E500, A250, DT770, etc. It all sucks in one way or another.
The O2 is so good that I really don't care to hold on to my other gear. So, I'm debating whether the pack rat instinct should be overcome. Don't PM me with offers though since I haven't yet made up my mind. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

(1) AKG K340,
(2) AKG K501,
(3) AKG K701.
The jury's still out as-to whether the K501 are number 1 or (a very, very close) number 2. : )

I'm surprised you rank the QP85 and YH-1 over the SR-Gamma. My Gamma is not a true Gamma. It's a franken phone built by Sptizer with an Alpha Pro headband and cups, SR-X drivers, and Lambda cord.
I'm also surprised you put the SR-X below the ATH-A900, although I've heard neither.

I have a Audio Technica AT-706 electret that I need to listen to more. I assume it would go somewhere on that list. I probably should sell some of my other headphones that I don't listen to at all.
Edit: I decided to give the AT-706 a listen out of the headphone jack of my NAD amp. I had to turn it up so loud the SR-Gammas became speakers. Quickly turned off my SRD-7. I'm like the sound of the AT-706.

I like my Gamma just fine, it's just that my other stats do everything that it does a bit better, on the other hand it does not have what QP85 and YH-1 can give me. It's all based on personal preference so YMMV  SR-X I simply don't like, I find it irritating.

The adapter for the 706 is at work, but it's terminated with a TRS plug so I've been listening out of my NAD's headphone jack. It requires the volume knob at 2 o'clock. The loudest I can play any other headphone is 8 o'clock. Gives me some idea about how hard the K340 is to drive. I'll have to bring home the adapter box to hear if sounds better run off of the speaker outs.

Since I just got DT880 (06?) I am surprised you ranked them so low  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) HD600 (for classical music and jazz), and AKG240 sextett (for rock and metal)
2) HD515 and AKG240 studio (for listening to older records where the above are to revealing).
That bieng said 'best' is quite impractical when it comes to headphones as few would find one headphone that is perfect for every style of music they like. Also synergy between components plays a big part in what one will prefer. That bieng said, I would take my HD600 and sextett, over m 240 studio's and HD515's any day.)

Everything below the QP85 is so close, they should a probably be rated the same. Which I listen to depends on what I'm listening to, what mood I'm in, and how much comfort I need.
I wouldn't want to get rid of anything on this list. And these are the headphones I listen to on a regular basis, not counting commuting. My UM1s don't belong on this list at all unless I rate how they sound on the subway, in which case all of these would rate 0. The Magnavox is not the best headphone, but I like having an inexpensive stat set up at work.
I need to buckle down and sell some of my other headphones, like my Sextetts. I never listen to them anymore.

Yet another update. Headphones in category (1) are just awesome. Category (2) is for great phones that are almost as good as the top phones only I like them just a tiny bit less. Category (3) is for very good HPs that do something exceptionally well, but have a flaw. Category (4) is for headphones that are very good for a specific use or type of music but can't compete with top phones for overall sound quality. Headphones in category (5) have a something that bugs me, but are still good headphones and are enjoyable with a lot of different music. Category (6) is for headphones that disappointed me greatly and annoyed me with something although were not bad if you look at it objectively. Order inside categories really does not matter.

1a. Sennheiser HD580
2. Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80ohm
2b. Etymotic ER-4P
3. Sennheiser HD25 Concorde Edition
4. Sennheiser HD25-1 II
5. Sennheiser HD525
6 AKG K301 (old red one)
7. AKG K240DF
8. Sennheiser HD490 "Classic"
9. Grado SR-125
10. Old AKG K141 (Silver, strange ribbed cord, but solid headband)
11. Sennheiser HD440 II
12. Realistic Nova 30 Pro
...
7000. Half dozen or so crappy pairs of earbuds. Several crappy Coby headsets that I bought solely for the foam pads.
I realize things like the K240DF and the SR125 are great headphones, but they just aren't that enjoyable to me. Especially the grados -- just too piercing even with EQ, plus the thick cord is unwieldy. The K240DFs are nice, but I have too many pairs that are just more fun to listen to.
I'd say everything past #3 are going away real (ebay most likely) soon. I may keep the 490s for work headphones, though, since they're light, open enough to hear the phone/other people, and cheap enough to leave on my desk.
Once my replacement 580 headband comes in, I'll be able to really test the HD580s against the K701, and the lose there might just get sold. I got such a great deal on both pairs that it will be hard to part with one, though.
And I haven't really used my etys much in several months, so I may ditch them as well, unless I find the HD25s have too little isolation for MAX. Speaking of the HD25s, I only list the Concorde edition ahead because of the convenience factor - they fit me just fine, and I don't have to fiddle with the 2 adjustable headbands, and adjustable left earcup. The one drawback is the EXTREMELY microphonic cable -- I think it may have hardened for some reason.

Is the Realistic Nova 30 Pro the ortho? Here's a pic from the ortho thread 
If they are, with some simple reversible mods, you can move them up the list. Probably not up to 3 up up quite a bit.

Another update. Headphones in category (1) are just awesome. Category (2) is for great phones that are almost as good as the top phones only I like them just a tiny bit less. Category (3) is for very good HPs that do something exceptionally well, but have a flaw. Category (4) is for headphones that are very good for a specific use or type of music but can't compete with top phones for overall sound quality. Headphones in category (5) have a something that bugs me, but are still good headphones and are enjoyable with a lot of different music. Category (6) is for headphones that disappointed me greatly and annoyed me with something although were not bad if you look at it objectively. Order inside categories really does not matter.

I do not, but it's very nice and I like it a lot. I also don't prefer SR-404 to SR-303 or SR-303 to SR-Lambda. I think that original normal bias Lambda is one of the best. But I am strange, I like Lambda Pro and Lambda Signature less than LNS and Lambda. If I had to rank all stats I heard this would be the ranking:Stax SR-Sigma

You like DT880, HD600 and AH-D5000 more than ESP950. Well this just once and for all shows me that people look for completely different things in sound.

My collection actually grew some more rather than shrink. I'm still going to downsize someday!
Top five would be:
AKG K701
Sennheiser HD-580
Audio Technica ATH-AD700 --> can't believe how comfortable these are!
AKG K240 Sextett --> I have no idea what year they were made, but they are in great condition. I thought I was just bidding on plain k240s actually. They sound nothing, NOTHING like the k240DFs, which is a very good thing.

1. STAX 2050
2. STAX SR-001

5. HD251-II
I know technically the HD25s should belong right below the SR-001 but I can't get over the lack of transparency and grainy mids on them (this is with the OFC cable too). In reality I would probably have a tie between the Atrios and HD25s.
With that said I still can't bring myself to sell them because they can be so useful in terms of blocking ambient noise and not having to rely on IEMs.

The Koss esp 950 is a great cans, I like it a lot with singers like Sara K or Patricia Barber.But 90% of my cd collection are Rock cds, so I like cans with more bass and dynamics then 950, this is the only reason the Koss is not at the top of my list.

Grado rules and then AKG and then Sennheiser and so onOpen headphones
1 Grado SR-325i (I like the immediacy and hyper detail)
2 AKG 701 (so far so good, still breaking in)
3 Yuin PK1 (Incrediable ear buds with lots of bass, but need to be amped)
4 Sennheiser HD-595 (good for all music cans)
5 Grado SR-60 (the best bargain in headphones--simply amazing performance).
Closed headphones
1 AKG 271S (excellent mids, lean bass, good highs, great detail, reminds me of good quality studio monitors but slighly warmer sounding).
Overall ranking (both types)
1 Grado SR-325i
2. AKG 701
3. AKG 271S
4. Yuin PK1
5. Sennheiser HD-595
6. Grado SR-60
Overall, my favourite cans are the Grado SR-325i. Recently, I acquired a pair of AKG 701's. These show great promise. The Yuin PK1's are excelent. I am very fond of my AKG 271s. Still, the best can for the buck is the Grado SR-60 and I really enjoy them and use them for portable applications (along with the Yuin Pk1's). .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Disclaimer: This list is purely based on preference and doesn't necessarily reflect the technical abilities of the phones mentioned.
1. SR-007 (current favorite and I hope to improve on them with a better amp)
2. K701 stock (spacious but unspectacular sound. I can listen to anything with these, but nothing will sound exceptionally good)
3. K701 RAL-recabled (technically these might be a bit better, but I prefer the relaxed sound of my stock pair)
4. K1000 (my main beef with these is their brightness, can't say they lack an unduly amount of bass though)
5. ATH-AD2000 (can sound hollow sometimes and makes me feel deaf after a while due to some peak in the higher midrange)
6. SR-X MKIII (love the midrange, lacks bass)
7. ATH-CK7 (energetic sound, slightly on the bright side but with good punch)
8. Sony MDR-E575 (old earbuds with interesting soundstaging abilities, non-fatiguing highs and bloated bass)
9. Philips SBC HP460 (one of the few cheap portables with tight bass, but is slightly hollow sounding)
10. Sony MDR-E888 (new earbuds without bass or soundstage)

Those on the same line are sorta an apple and oranges type thing, but I put them in the same ballpark in sq with their respective rigs and intended purpose. These are from my current line-up:
Tier One: Sony MDR-R10, Stax 007 MK1, UE11 (all wonderful, just different)
Tier Two: HD600 > HF1 > ESW9, PK1
Tier Three: PK100 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Tier 1: HD650 > HD600 > GS1000
Tier 2: K501 = MS2i > K701
Tier 3: SR125 = MS1 > SR80 > ER6 > Proline 750
Tier 4: HD201 > EP630 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1st: K701
2nd: SR225, Atrio M8
4th: B&O A8
Sadly, or thankfully, the K701 might be the end of the line for me. I had a few ideas for future upgrades and so far all of them have disappointed me. Maybe I'll just recable the K701s and call it good, with a proper amp and source they're just perfect to my ears. The only headphone on my list now is more of a sidestep than an upgrade, the Beyer DT770.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hmm, I find the headphones I have now are very much suited to whichever mood I may be in, almost as much as the type of music I want to listen too. I could happily listen to heavy rock with over-bearing bass (the Pannys) or clean, airy, neutral phones (the HD201s). If I had to rank them...HTX7 - bassy and I'm hoping they improve their soundstage with burn in, but they look adorable and for rap, electronica or bass guitar heavy stuff like QOTSA (lord knows how Kyuss would sound, I need to get some) they're very up front and domineering, which fits the music style.HD201 - Work wonders with my Bowie collection and music from the same era. Light on bass, but they do very good vocals and guitars sound pronounced, which I like. A very relaxing listen. The extra long cable makes these ideal for plugging into my TV when playing my Xbox 360, too.KSC-75 - Very good for the $5 they cost me, with a good amount of bass and a nice open sound, which is at odds with the two closed cans above. The clips are a bit of a pain though and they're not best-suited to prolonged listening. Nice to have the choice, though.Philips SHC-HS910 - Great all-rounders. Good sound, very comfortable, holding up well with age. Their ace is that they fold in the middle, whilst the cups swivel and they fold up into their own pouch, so ideal for traveling, with little sound compromise. They probably sound as good as the Koss, so they're only last because they're the oldest. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

My only thread that has lasted
My thinking now is that headphones can't be considered without also taking into account the amps that drive them.
So my current lineup.
1) HeAudio EH-1.2B Driven by a Woo Audio GES (Maxed out, including Siltech wiring)
2) AKG K-701's (Sitting idle until I can get a Woo Audio WA-5LE to drive them) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

^^ it looks like you have taken a liking to the Woo amps - one for each type. not bad. i think both amps you mention - the GES and WA5 - are excellent. re the 1.2B, i am still waiting for the "official" version to be released. from what i remember i think it would complement my O2 very well and may make my HE60 expendable (maybe). 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Tier 2-----------
...Stax SR-404 with SRM-T1S
...Stax SR-003 with SRM-252a
...ATH-ESW9, primary portable use with iMod.
A couple others of no rank.
I know my take on the UE9 and SR007 may/will be contentious to some but I think I have had these two long enough to know the character of each and this is how I hear them. My source is the Lavry DA10 and some say that this DAC is dead or characterless but that to me is a good thing for a DAC. Even by it's detractors from these characteristics essentially prove it's neutral sound. When I want colored sound I have the musical UE9 and Yamamoto. When I want a reference sound I have the SR-007MkII and KGSS. I would say the best or near-so of both worlds.

2) AKG K-701's (Sitting idle until I can get a Woo Audio WA-5LE to drive them)


Agree 110%... and... also the source - the synergy / matching of the complete set up makes a huge difference. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Stax SR-007BL
2. AKG K1000
3. Stax 4070
4. Stax SR-404
The AKG K1000 making its way up my list. But I am quite sure it stops there... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hard To Tell...My ranking is based on the setups and combinations in my signature - most recently all phones driven out of the line stage of my M24 into my $100 portable SS Shellbrook Labs Maxi Moy with OPA627s, which sounds as good as my DV332 (which was incredible). The difference is in the M24 line stage and my sources - that permit the Maxi Moy to drive all my phones to incredible sound quality. It is simply amazing - and a valuable "lesson learned." Great sound quality is totally dependant upon the combination of components - how well they match one another - and not necessarily related to how much they cost.
0. Ideal set up - 10.0
1. Denon D5000s - 9.5
2. Grado RS-1s / Sennheiser HD580/600s (new version) - 9.2
3. ATH AD2000s - 9.0
They're all so very close its very hard to rank them - and they all sound so very similar - only very slight variances too minor to distinguish them from one another (e.g. D5000s have a bit more 3D soundstage, and finite resolution, etc.).
As good as these set ups are... its very hard to imagine how many phones/setups could be much better... but... I left .5 points for the possiblity that the Ed9s, or Stax 007 MKII, with the right matching set ups could be.
I can assure you... you will be very pleased with any of these with the set ups in my signature, or others that may match them well.
But... by far... the most significant factor determining the quality of the sound... is... the set up and the synergy it has with whatever phones (assuming you have a good set of phones).

I think your sources are better for Stax. Headphones with mild highs, like Stax Omega or Sennheiser HD650, sounds very good with computer stuf. Yet K1000 need very noble source and tube amplifier or preamplifier.

Another update. Headphones in category (1) are just awesome. Category (2) is for great phones that are almost as good as the top phones only I like them just a tiny bit less. Category (3) is for very good HPs that do something exceptionally well, but have a flaw. Category (4) is for headphones that are very good for a specific use or type of music but can't compete with top phones for overall sound quality. Headphones in category (5) have a something that bugs me, but are still good headphones and are enjoyable with a lot of different music. Category (6) is for headphones that disappointed me greatly and annoyed me with something although were not very bad if you look at it objectively. Order inside categories really does not matter.

Denon D2000 - warm, bassy, rich, nice soundstage, comfortable.
Koss PortaPro - 1/3 of the D2000 straight up. have a look at the freq curve over at headroom. compensate your EQ for it and you will take notice. sounds rather good then.
Sony MDR V3 - from memory, sounded good then. cant tell for sure anymore.
Senn CX300 - decent if you can get it for a discount. wouldnt pay retail for it.
Senn MX70 Sport - these things sing. lime yellow and water/sweat resistance. cant go wrong for the gym or for a run.
Grado SR80 - a revelation, brings out the detail you never knew were there if this is your first upgrade form stock. very forward, bright sound. could get your teeth grating after a while. lacks bass extension for my taste.
Stock buds that came with the Creative Micro - heck of a lot better than other stock buds ive come across. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

ATH-A700 - great detail, crisp bass, comfortable
SR80 - little more bass, harsher highs, little scratchy on the ears
PX100 - close to the SR80s but a little less bass, featherweight
iPod buds - always falling out of my ears, moderate detail
I find myself mostly listening to the Grados although I swap with the AT's and they sound technically better the Grado's but the Grado's have a great warm, rough, rock sound.

1. AKG K501 - I can't get enough of these cans. Just when I think I have found something better (HD650 & K701) they pull me back in. I really haven't heard a headphone that comes close. It freaks me out that with my current setup they are underpowered and they still manage to be my favorite by a large stretch.2. (tie) Senn HD650 - The only thing I don't like is the slight midrange colorization. I find them quite neutral otherwise. The bass is unreal, never overpowering the rest of the spectrum just low, fully controlled and fully detailed.2. (tie) Senn HD580 - The HD650 made me appreciate the HD580 more. If they didn't have that slight midbass hump they would edge out the HD650. IMO they lack the overall detail, clarity and control of the HD650 though. I tried to sell them in favor of the HD650 about a week ago and I just couldn't do it.4. AKG K701 - They are excellent but the K501 does everything better except for overall resolution. They won a rock battle with my late DR150s to become my go to rock headphone. They are just not as smooth as my other headphones and they have a very "look at me" attitude because of the effect caused by the hitch in its lower treble.

HD555 great sound stage with crappy bass for the price. Excellent for games and music but totally useless for music epically Trance and Rock.
You are far better off with the HD280 PRO 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

How about...1st would be my Koss ESP950
2nd would be The Stax SRX-MRK III
then it gets tough
3rd would be the Grado SR-60's
4th Koss porta pro and KSC75's
5th Sony MDR51
6th I have 2 different brand of no name in ears that are very good considering

TakeT H2 - Magical snares, fearsome bass. Can't begin to imagine the bass when driven directly.
HD650 - The best balanced (no pun intended) headphone I've ever heard. Does everything I've thrown at it well.
V3 Darth Beyers - Cleaner bass than the stock DT770s. More fun than high-fidelity.
DT770 - A fun, bassy headphone through and through. Has a nice amount of isolation.
HD212 - My first foray into high-end headphones. Sounded good at the time, passable at this point. Bloated bass, earpads didn't fit me well and managed to make ambient noise more noticeable.
iPod Earbuds - Should be obvious why these are last.

The rest is kind of hard to quantify. Due to a shipping screw-up, I lack my SoundMagic PL-30s. I've heard a friend's PX100s, SR60s and AD700s several times, but never critically.

yes, strange the sa5000 hasnt got more support here, i guess its a little too light on bass and on the bright side for the many people here that prefer a warmer sound.
the pro 750 is in another level compared to the dt-150 which has far too much bass colouration making everything sound warm and bassey right up to the hi-mids and treble but it is only a £100 headphone. the 750 by comparison sounds more balanced/natural, open, faster and engaging.

Yeah, the K1000 have jumped up to take the lead.
The SR-007BL are a magic headphone, no question asked. I just don't have the proper amplifier to bring it to life... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I don't know if any of you agree but here goes.
D2000 - Might be something to do that these are the newest. They perform well all-around but impressive, although maybe little boomy, bass gives them the lead.
Dt-880 '03 - The clarity and the little thin but punchy bass gives them the second place.
Hd-600 - These are the oldest one of these three and they kind of sound like that. They dont have the we exciting highs of the 880s nor the impressive lower spectrum of the Denons. They are not bad, listening to them just is somewhat boring. It's like the average of the above phones and I don't want to hear average.
Source is Fubar III, so there maybe explanation to the Senns unability to impress. Maybe someday I'll know (if) when I'm going to update that. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I can't deny it anymore. The Champ has been dethroned. The HD650 take up somewhere around 65% of the total time I spend listening to music through headphones. They have to be my favorites right? My sweet, sweet K501s....

2. Denon D7000 - the best bass I've heard from a can - DEEP and tight.
3. Alessandro MS-Pro - more neutral and balanced than RS1. Good for general listening.
4. AKG K702 (with Black Dragon cable) - the best soundstage I've heard from a can. Superb for classical, if a little cold and clinical for other genres.

I really like the Lambda. My next purchase would probably be a more expensive Stax phone because they provide me exactly what I want. I still have fond memories of my Darth Beyer but unless I can score a pair of deep cups for cheap, I'm not going to purchase another dynamic headphone. The only phones I disliked are AD900 and the SR225. I cannot listen to either of those headphones for more than 20 mins.

Time for an update. Headphones in category (1) are just awesome. Category (2) is for great phones that are almost as good as the top phones only I like them just a tiny bit less. Category (3) is for very good HPs that do something exceptionally well, but have few flaws. Category (4) is for headphones that are very good for a specific use or type of music but can't compete with top phones for overall sound quality. Headphones in category (5) have a something that bugs me, but are still good headphones and are enjoyable with a lot of different music. Category (6) is for headphones that disappointed me greatly or annoyed me with something although were not very bad if you look at it objectively. Order inside categories really does not matter.

Update - I now feel that a list without considering the rest of the system is of little actual use. Since I almost never listen ampless it's obvious that I consider all headphones limited by the source and the amp.
1) Jade driven by a loaded Woo Audio GES, Source Exemplar Audio XD-1 Dac and Exemplar Music Server. All Siltech cabling
2) AKG K-701 driven by an Exemplar Audio modded ASL OTL-32, same sources.
Several new amps and headphones are making their way through my system soon, so this list will be changing.

1)M50 - Awesome from top to bottom. Bass is uncanny (NOT overly emphasised) Very neutral, but so so soundstage. To me these destroy the D2000 in almost all areas.
2)HD595 - I use these for all music and gaming. Very good all around.
3)k701 - extreme detail. A bit harsh in the highs and "thin" vocals. But probably will never get rid of them because on some music these headphones are magic.
4)UE Triple Fi 10 - awesome for the gym!
5)AD700 - awesome for COD/fps. Love being accused of hacking. Bass is very weak.
6)A700 - Descent. Bigger soundstage than the M50, but everything else is several steps down. I use them for gaming sometimes.
7)RX900 (modded) - I don't like the sound signature on these at all. Before or after the mod.
Been thinking of selling all except M50 and triple fi's to help fund HD800's or T1 !!!

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

This is PERSONAL preference. I like fun, colored headphones, over audiophile-esque balanced headphones... I'm also going to add headphones I have recently owned but sold...
1.) XB700 - Incredible BASS. I loved getting lost in the sea of bass. Clear for a bass heavy headphone. Sold due to uncomfortable issues with the padding.
2.) DT770 Pro 80 - Lovely bass, fun, fun, fun. Super comfortable. Gaming and watching movies with these are AWESOME.
3.) M50 - Balanced monsters with slight emphasis on bass, but still fairly neutral. Great bargain, and my most preferred in overal comfort, fit, and clamp. Everyone should try these at least once in their lifetime. Sold because they were too much like the DT770 Pro 80, so I didn't need them.
4.) DT880 - Seriously balanced, great for gaming, and VERY clear. If I was an audiophile, these would be number 1, no question.
5.) KSC75 - CHEAP, fun, unbelievable for the price
6.) RE0 - Incredibly neutral, clear, precise. Gets the most use, since I use them everytime I'm out of the house. They'd be number 2 if I was an audiophile.
7.) AD700 - AWESOME soundstage, crisp, and MADE for gaming. Super comfy ear pads, but uncomfortable fit, and my ears touched the drivers. Would be probably number 5 if they fit MUCH better, and my ears didn't touch the drivers.
Yes, I prefer the KSC75 over the RE0. I LOOOOVE the AD700s, but the fit really hurt it for me.

Favorites top to bottom:
Sennheiser HD800 - Excellent all around. Best soundstage. Recommended.
Beyerdynamic T1 - Also excellent. To me, even more detailed than HD800. Hard to drive with some SS amps. Good soundstage but noticeably less soundstage than HD800. (Less than 200 hours, so may get even better over time.) Recommended.
Grado RS2i - Clarity. Great at low volume. Easy to drive. Use at work. Recommended.
Byer DT880 - Good all round. Great frequency response. To me, most comfortable earphones of all. Lack clarity with complex music. In process of selling because get little head time since HD800 and T1 came into house. Recommended.
Advent Wireless AW770 - Pretty good overall wireless phones, but hard to keep static free.
Senn PMX80 - Use when running. Best running headphone I have ever used. Recommended.
Sony MDR-V6 - Fair. Weak bottom end. Mids and treble are good.
Sony CD Walkman headphones - Not bad, but do not compare to PMX80s.
ipod earbuds - Crap, midrange only, not very loud out of ipod.

- Beyerdynamic DT880, Sennheiser HD650 (TIE - DT880 has bright highs; HD650 clamps my fat head hard!)

I think the best way to describe the HD580/600 is it may not sound all that fnacy at first, but it does very little wrong, which makes it a terrific headphone.

I have recently recabled my new HD-800 and AKG-702 headphones with my brand new
patented audio cable, the results are astonishing and if there is a meet in northern California
I would like to bring them to have other people hear the results. The stock HD-800 headphones
are really good to begin with but the sound kind of disappears it is so non electrical sounding.

1. Senn HD580 with 650 cable - Old, ratty things. Lovely though, like a knackered, yet impossibly comfortable pair of trainers.
2. Senn HD 600 - Standard, almost new, less comfy than the 580s.
3. AKG K701 - erm, they're 701s. I prefer the Senns for the usual reasons.

Changed my headphone lineup a bit lately, in order of preference for music:
 
ESW9A
MS-Pro
KSC75
DT770 Pro
HFI780
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



You're selling the ultrasones already - didnt you just get them?? They must be pretty crap, ranked lower than the KSC75. Then again if you plug the KSC75 into a really nice amp you'll be pleasantly surprised (I know I was - it brought a smile to my face :D ).
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yes, just got them, they were just to give me insight to the Ultrasone sound. Didn't take very long to know that they weren't for me. Plus I'm trying to fund a future new amp and DT880s :D
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

DT990/600
DT880/250
 
yeah yeah, i only have 2 cans, leave me alone head-fi ^_^
 
plan on selling the DT880's for either a Senn HD600 or a DT880/600 [or maybe both] in the near future when i have upgraded to a better amp.

David... (sorry for the OT).Be prepared for a bit of a shock if you go from DT880 (of any ohm flavor) to the HD600. I think they are great, but very different. If you're liking the Beyer 'sound' and just want it improved a bit, just go with the 600 ohm. If you are looking for a real departure from that Beyer sound, yeah, well you just may love the HD600.   JMHO.
 
Now back to our regularly scheduled thread...

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. HD800
1. PS1000
1. T1
 
What's best?  
 
The HD800 has the largest soundstage and is the fastest, most neutral and most revealing of the three.  It can hear God's thoughts.
The PS1000 is the most intimate, easiest to drive, and most passionate.  It puts me on stage.
The T1 is the most liquid, most versatile of the three.  It does everything extremely well.  It may be the most musical of them all.

3. HFI-15G
4. K240M

6. EAH500
7. DD1
 
and YES - the HDJ1000 is THAT good! I bought them last week - used and pretty beaten, but they are damn good sounding - they sound, looks and feels VERY similar to K181DJ.

I love the beyerdynamic cans. Especially the 990's because they handle my taste in music quite well.  I find the 880/250 ohm a bit too analytical, so they are mostly used with any laid back/acoustic/relaxing/vocal centric tracks. They do precision gaming quite well, but since I don't do anything competitive, the 990's stay on my head for majority of the time 
 
but i would love to try a different flavor headphone and maybe switch it up with one of the Sennheiser HD600's since i have never tried their high end models before. I would love a departured/unique/warm sound to get away from my beyers on those brisk Saturday/Sunday nights  , No doubt in my mind that the 880/600 will be everything i need [that the 990's aren't] but throwing in a Sennheiser in the mix might not be too shabby at all

I certainly understand that (notice the Denons in my lineup). I'm really enjoying the differences and reason they each fit into their respective niche.

The dt 48 has little bass, but it does sound like reality and fruity and when i mean fruity well it does not sound like it has a veil and compared to reality sounds just like it plus on some tracks i have played and compareing the hd 650 since the bass goes deeper towards the dt 48, the dt 48 can have punchy mid bass if you have it on loud and vibrate your head.
 
If your very fussy about headphones and want it just right i'd go with the dt 48 and you won't be disappointed except the bass.
 
I love my dt 48.
 
Just sounds like reality, you have to hear them your self very clear not muffled like the hd 650 even though i do like the bass of the hd 650 but i keep reaching for the dt 48.

Sony MDR-CD-870 Headphones
I love these even after 11-12 years. Smooth clean and uncolored sound. They fit like a glove and are able to be worn at hours on end. What more do you want? These get to be in the number two slot after being my favorites for ever.
 
 
AKG k701 Headphones
These are great for vocals but seem to have too little bass for rock. I have a love/hate ate relationship that started 1.5 years ago and still goes on. I would not ever be able to sell them so the war goes on. These go into the number three slot after the crazy love hate relationship!
 
 
Denon AH-D 7000 Headphones
I knew these were it after only 30 seconds in my system. The best for me. These are number one and will always be an amazing piece of art in my life. They show me stuff I have never heard before. The smooth rendition today of 24/96 record rips once again proved with out question these are keepers.
 
 
Bose On-Ears
I will not even rate these. I have them as an alternative pair to leave the house with. They are stupid and fun.
 
Bose In-Ears
Even after no much hate I read here about Bose, these are my main portables. They will not be rated. They are stupid and fun.

I found these to be the equivalent of the AKG 701ks in potable fashion. I will not rate these. They are again cool for a balanced replay on the road. They offer a great value.

Here's a list in order from BEST to NOT BEST: Paid under $200 category (Denon D2000 (189),  Sennheiser HD595($150, Don't sound quite as good as the ultrasone 580 but the comfort makes up for it :-),Ultrasone Hfi 580(150), Dr. Dre Beats Pro ($400), Audio Technica M50 ($97), Beyerdynamic DT770 $140) (Almost have to have an amp if you like your music loud), Sennheiser HD555 ($100)  , Dr. Dre Beats Tour/koss porta pro
 
 
I was wondering why most lists don't mention the denon d2000? i thought they were the best around $200, the ultrasone hi580 at $150 price point, and the audio technica at $100. But I would like to know what headphones from Ultrasone, Audio Technica, and if anyone else has some punchy closed headphones. Thanks!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Since someone else just bumped this thread (thanks!) I'll do my current list in order of best sounding headphones from best to worst:
 
AKG k601
Koss Pro DJ 100
AKG k240
Modded Koss UR-55 (grill removed)
Maxell DHP-II
Beyer Dynamic DT-235
Audio Technica ATH-M30
 
My overall favorite (not just based on sound quality) is the Koss Pro DJ 100. A $80 headphone shouldn't sound this good. Same can be said about the $30 DHP-II that impressed me from day one.

Current headphones:
DT990/600: 9.5/10.
Considering the many headphones I have purchased this past year, the 990s are pretty much everything I have ever wanted in a headphone.
Open, airy soundstage, crisp signature, amazing bass that isn't ever overwhelming, very detailed mids even considering that they bass and treble emphasized, and bright sound. They are fantastic for gaming, and due to their quick and punchy bass, it doesn't distract me from the finer details, so they are wonderful for both fun and competitive gaming.
They are fantastic for pretty much every thing I listen to. They would get a perfect 10/10 for me once I pair it up with a tube amp or a warmer opamp for my E9 to smooth out the treble. The treble is pretty aggressive for most people. I like aggressive treble, but I can see benefits in softening up just a little bit.
Creative Aurvana Live: 8/10. I got these from Newegg for $65. They are honestly worth much more. They are comparable to the M50s for me, with a warmer signature, and smoother treble. Other than that, they are 90% like the M50, with more soundstage depth and width. They are super comfortable, light, and sleek. I'm selling them to a friend, but they have served me very well.
KSC75: 8/10. For $13 these are absolutely phenomenal. Sound alone is comparable to over $60 headphones. I love them. I like that it doesn't isolate well at all, so I can hear when the phone rings at my job and whatnot. When I'm at home, the quiet really helps to bring out their fantastic sound. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I'm revising my list due to some new additions/subtractions/tweaks:

T1
Edition 8LE
RS1i
SE535
Nuforce NE-8
Hifiman RE0
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

A small update to my list:
1. AKG K271's = EQ'd MDR-V6's.
2. Stock V6's
3. Koss KSC75's
 
I like having bass on the V6's, and with some of the highs EQ'd down they really, really sound great. They don't have the soundstage of the K271's, and the mids are probably 80% of the K271's, but with the added bass in my mind they are about equal.
 
I think I need to invest in the K240's, as I love the sound of the K271's, and if the K240's were like the V6's and 271's combined I'd be in heaven. The money just hasn't been there, so I'll have to hold out for a while.

Revisiting this thread after a few changes finds this order...
 
 
Full-Size
AH-D7000... Just freakin' gorgeous sound. Round, smooth, 'acoustic'.
ATH-M50... 'cause they're great and basically little brothers to the D7k. I wear them almost as much as my D7k.
DT880 / 600 Ohm... Brilliant, the epitome of clarity, transparency and detail.
 
IEM's
DBA-02... Holy crap these things are wonderful. They're open and transparent, bright and clear. Mostly neutral and slightly forward.
UM2... Round and rich like the D7k, but without the brilliant highs. Great sonority and warmth.
E4c's... Great workout (gym) IEM's. Impressive clarity and realism. Built like a tank.
 
Waiting for the January Bay Area Meet to try out the LCD-2. Doubtless they (or T1) will eventually end up at the top of the Full-Size list.

My MS1s are the best but I use the Apex the most as they are closed. I also like the wireless aRoc so in the winter the cord doesn't make loud sounds and become really stiff when I listen to podcasts. Its ok with music because the music drowns out the noise the cords make, and at - 40C I don't want to take my good headphones outside with me.

I don't have too many but it would have to be:
 
1. Alessandro MS1i - Great, fun headphones, I personally find them comfortable but not as much as others I have tried.
 
1=. Senheisser HD555 - Don't personally own these but tried them and preferred my MS1i's for tunes. The comfort on these however makes them just as good. Will be investing. :D
2. Koss KSC75 - Could be considered a bit harsh but I personally like them and for their price they are incredible.
3. Brainwavz M2 - My only current IEM's and have a good sound for the price. Comes with tons of tips. (3 pairs of foam tips and 3 silicon tips)
4. Koss PortaPro - Very comfortable but prefer the KSC75's for sound. These are more harsh but are more 'fun'. Usually have the KSC75 drivers on the PortaPro's housing anyway.
5. iBuds and other bundled earphones - Terrible. Nuff said.

Headphones in category (1) are just awesome. Category (2) is for great phones that are almost as good as the top phones only I like them just a tiny bit less. Category (3) is for very good HPs that do something exceptionally well, but have a flaw. Category (4) is for headphones that are very good for a specific use or type of music but can't compete with top phones for overall sound quality. Headphones in category (5) have a something that bugs me, but are still good headphones and are enjoyable with a lot of different music. Category (6) is for headphones that disappointed me greatly and annoyed me with something although were not bad if you look at it objectively.

2. Sennheiser HD-598 / Koss Pro DJ 100 (tie)
3. AKG K702
4. AKG K240 Studio
5. KRK KNS-8400
 
ATH-AD2000 is the best headphone i've ever heard, but it's hard to like too much because it's not perfect. I have to do a mod just to make them comfortable. I'll never get rid of them because I've found it's the best headphone i've had for vocals and gaming. I could easily live with the HD-598 instead of this though. It's not that much worse. If there's a clone of the ATH-AD2000 that's more comfortable, i'd like to know. HD-598 is close.
 
Koss Pro DJ 100 has my near perfect sound signature and it's a fun headphone to listen to. I love headphones with slightly forward mids, but lately I've been wanting to find one that's open with good mids. The HD-598 has the forward sounding mids like the DJ100, but has more extended highs and a little less bass, but a bigger soundstage, but poorer imaging. Comfort is much better, so if you write down on paper each strengths and weaknesses, they're about even. The HD-598 feels like an open version of my perfect sound signature and it feels totally different than any of the other Sennheiser headphones. It's the headphone i've been using the most lately.
 
Every time I put it on, I'm impressed with it's sound. I was comparing tiny details on my ATH-AD2000 vs my HD-598 and some details have more presence on the HD-598. I can't say they're more detailed though. The HD-598 seems to fix all the problems with my old K601 and because of that it's a much better headphone. It's not quite as clear sounding as the K702 though. The sound signature of the HD-598 is just so much smoother than my ATH-AD2000 and that's a surprise. It's much less "shouty". I imagine people who like the ATH-AD2000 and K601 might like the HD-598. HD-598 is somewhat "laid back", but not anywhere like the HD-600, HD-555 or HD-600. It seems to be a mix of two different types of headphones.
 
The KRK is my replacement for my DJ100 and old SRH-840 for when I can't use an amp. It's the most detailed headphone I own, but it doesn't do anything to make my music more fun to listen to. It can be boring at times. I originally didn't think this at first, but now I do. It's a bit too bright for me at times. If I had to choose any for use as a studio monitor, then it'd definitely be this.
 
My K702 gets the least time on my head. I'm going to end up selling it. It's a nice headphone, but I feel that most detail is too distant due to it's soundstage. It just doesn't feel accurate. I prefer the K240 really, but the K702 is still the better headphone in most areas. I'd easily take the K702 first and that's why I ranked them higher. Too bad the K240 doesn't have detail, highs and clarity of the K702. K702 makes me feel like I'm 3 rows away from the stage. Most say otherwise?!

Another update to my list.
 
1. AKG K601 - Haven't had a chance to hear my pair, but I've heard the K601's before, and they were my favorite headphones ever. 
2. AKG K271 - We had a rocky start, but I've grown to love them. To me they have just about the perfect tonality. I think the K601's should cover the flaw these have: rolled off bass.
2. (tied) Koss Pro DJ100 - Very similar in sound signature to the K271's, but with more bass impact. Still pretty rolled off in the low end, but not like the K271's. Sold them to put toward the K601's. They did go to a good home though: A budding audiophile. 
3. Sony MDR-V6
4. Koss KSC75
 
Actually, I'm going to throw in the Pro DJ100's. I don't own them anymore, but I didn't post here when I did, so now is their time in the sun.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Sennheiser HD-580  I love these phones!  I've had'em for ever and will keep using them for the forseeable future.
2. Bose AE2  (tentative ranking: I own them but I don't have them yet.  They should arrive tomorrow.  All I've heard so far is the store demo, so I ranked them based on that.)
3. AKG K270  Pretty good actually, but relatively heavy, not so comfy, and weak bass.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My headphone list is pretty limited, and my selection is far from perfect, but these are the headphones that have started my expensive new hobby:
 
1. Sony MDR-v700dj (soon to be only used as dj monitors when my M50s arrive)
2. Behringer HPX-2000 (Lost in an apartment fire a couple of months ago)
3. Skullcandy Ink'd IEMs (I can't even listen to these anymore, they sound like mush)
 
My graduated list for future purchases:
 
1. Sennheiser HD 25-1 ii (will be used as production monitors)
2. AiAiAi TMA-1 (will be portable and sexy)
3. Audio Technica ATH-m50 (next logical step up from v700s)

Only going to list some high points...
 
Nonportable
 
1. HiFiMan HE-6
2. MB Quart MBP 95 X <> AKG K240 Sextett LP (tie; they sound quite different, but each satisfies a particular niche)
3. AKG K701
4. Grado SR80
 
Portable
 
1. Shure SRH 840
2. Sennheiser HD 25-1 II
3. MB Quart MBP 160
 
The Realistic Pro50 and K240 are very similar in sound; the Pro50 maybe has a fatter bass; I haven't done any direct comparison. The Pro50 is heavier and less comfortable, so the K240 gets the nod.
 
The MB Quart sound signature (for the phones I've tried, at least) is balanced, smooth, rolled off at the frequency extremes, and not intricately detailed. For some purposes, these are features, not faults: due to that and their incredibly light weight, the MBP 95X are my standard home office phones while I'm working; the HE-6 is better in all possible ways, but they're so good it's distracting...

I like cans with nice mids. Had the Senn 598 for a short while, will slot that just behind the HD25-II. The anime fan in me is prodding me to get the K701 (and kinda stupid reason to get this).

Hah, been there man. For the longest time they were my dream headphone, the reasons being a 50/50 split between their appearance on K-On, and the good things I heard about them.
 
I had the chance to compare them to the K601's, and while the K701's definitely sounded good, the K601's ultimately won me over. Though if I had the money, I'd totally get the K701's, if only to put on my desk.

        Second best, use em when I need a break from the DT990's or when I want to enjoy some awesome rock tunes.

        Never use these anymore, planning on selling them honestly. Closed cans are too warm for me.

The only headphone that wowed me and never gets old is the fostex t50rp they have the potential to compete with headphones costing 1k yet in the usa they cost peanuts 74 usd all you have to do is mod them.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
well...  i wasn't really trying to make any kind of statement by ranking the shures ahead of the flagship denons, or the trusty dt990.
it's just that, over time, the srh840 has revealed itself as a very reliable headphone.  with a very neutral sound.  it never makes any music sound bad.
while it blunts that last 5% of detail, i wouldn't call it veiled or hazy.  it just isn't as out-and-out clear as higher end headphones, that is for sure.
but, it has become a very comfortable and musical listen for me.  one that i find myself reaching for when i just want to enjoy the song, and not analyze every little nuance (a la HE-6).
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I can understand that. One of the things I liked the most about the shures was they didn't get in the way. They didn't have any glaring flaws, and they didn't over-emphasize anything. But I eventually sold them. Their strength eventually became their flaws. Even though they didn't mess anything up, they didn't excel at anything either and overtime became boring. But I think they are perfect for studio purposes.

well put.  and i concur, moodyrn.
 
conversely, the denon d7000 excels at several things, but has a few flaws that rear their head from time to time.
that boomy bass, that slightly recessed vocal range.
 
with the shures, i can put my music collection on random, and let 'er rip.
which is why they've become the headphone in my work rig.

Unfortunately, the only ones I own. And the K701s are being amped wrong. Bought an amp too early in my learning process and ended up with a FUBAR III. Does NOT flatter the K701s. Doesn't stop them from sounding beautiful though. HD280s are a lot more fun to listen to on the rig that I have, because of the bass they have, but it's like listening through a sweater. The sound is so smooshed together. Hoping to end up with a Little Dot MkII for my AKGs at some point... Ooooh to have the money for this hobby. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Going through all of these pages, I'm seeing that the same HPs come out on top on a lot of lists. It would be cool to see all the number 1s collated into a graph or something. I wonder who would come out on top. A loooot of Senns, Tons of Stax, and a lot of Beyers...

After adding the K 160 and getting rid of the K 271, the listing is like so:
 
AKG K 141 vintage
AKG K 160
(AKG K 314 buds)
Koss KSC75
 
The 314 buds get the most use by far, but sq-wise are only above the K 160. The K 160 get the second-most time on my head because of their way of bringing vocals forward and generally being nice, no-frills, rugged, lo-fi cans. The 141s I'd say are technically superior to the rest (not a big surprise) but I see them as kind of a vintage gem and don't want to wear them out. The KSC75 hang on to my mp3 player.

i'm going to sound like a noob for this because of what i own but here it goes
 
of all headphones i have ever owned here is the list
list is rated for sound quality only
 
1)shure srh840 (very clear and good for monitoring)
2)shure srh750dj (clear and very impressive bass)
3)akg k324p iems(absolutely amazing in my opinion, loved the sound these produce)
4) pioneer se m390 (good bass, decent highs, ok mids, awesome for the price)
5)sony mdr xd200 ( bad but still better then $100 skullcandy)
6)jvc flats(really good for $20)
7)sony mdr nc7(utter trash only good thing is they are noise cancelling)
8)skullcandy lowriders(for the price they are trash, bad build and sound)
9)skullcandy smokin buds(also trash even though they are cheap)
10)skullcandy gi(worst headphones ever considering they cost $100)
11)sony mdr v150s(used to think they were good but i now understand they really weren't, they are very muddy)
12)ibuds
13)cheap source brand iems(head rush)
 
so that's a run down of what i own rated by sound quality.

Since I'm bored and have been through so many headphones since my last post, I'll update my list:
 
These are not going by whats technically "Best", but what I prefer to listen to and like the most of course.
 
 
1) AKG K601
 
My K702 is more revealing and detailed, but it's treble needs to get tamed a little. It sounds a bit un-natural with some music. To me, the K601 is more of a front row like experience compared to the K702. I've found the mids are far more forward sounding and music is more engaging and fun to listen to on the K601. To me it seems to have a little extra bass and less treble. Its also a bit more comfortable and is more natural sounding than the K702. The K702 might have the slight edge when it comes to how clear the sound is. I could listen to this headphone for hours without feeling fatigued. Feels like a mix of a more aggressive headphone and a somewhat laid back one. I remember selling my HD-600 when I got this. I even kept this over the D2000 and DT-880 600 ohm. This along with the HD-598 and HD-650 are great for female vocals.
 
2) HD-650 / HD-598
 
I can't decide on this. The HD-598 is more fun and I prefer it's mids, but the HD-650 has a slightly clearer sound with more detail. Just now as fun to listen to. It took a new amp for me to love the HD-650. It's a hard headphone to like with the wrong amp.
 
The HD-598 is slightly less clear than the HD-600 and K601, but has the most addicting mids and the larger soundstage. The K601 is a little more laid back than the HD-598, but I thought it was the opposite at first! The HD-598 is also my #2 favorite gaming headphone.
 
BTW it took me forever to get the HD-650 to sound good. Hated it out of my Asgard. Too much bass, compressed soundstage and not that clear. The E9 made it more neutral, but seemed to suck the life out of it. With another amp I almost love it now. Just wish it was a tad more clear and less forgiving. I guess the K702 has me spoiled.
 
3) AKG K702
 
I love this, but I'm only at the 50 hour mark with this for burn-in. It's one of the best headphones there is but I always feel as if I'm 2 1/2 rows away from the stage and it takes awhile to get into that. It's soundstage is massive though, but not bigger than the AD700 soundstage I think. It took me going from the Asgard to the E9 to love this headphone and like it for gaming. The Micro Amp really makes it come alive. The treble is a bit bothersome and I hope it smooths itself out. The K601 seems to fix all my complaints about this headphone. I do prefer the K702 over the K601 for specific genres. I love ambient music (Helios), soundtracks and classical with this.
 
4) AKG K240 Studio
 
This is the one headphone I like so much that I don't think i'll ever sell it. I even prefer it to my Sextett LP! It's a great budget alternative to the HD-555 and it's super cheap!
 
5) AD700
 
I don't really like this for music, but for gaming it's not bad. Its soundstage is huge, but there is some recession in the mids. Unfortunately it's not comfortable at all for me.
 
 
I will skip all my closed headphones...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Of all the headphones I own/owned I'm gonna list the order of my personal preference, not the technically best sounding as we all know the perceived "best" is subjective and, well... i'm the subject!
 
1. SRH440 w/840 pads (big difference to me, with stock 440 pads, I actually don't like as much as the SRH840's. I know what a lot of you will say but, I love their sound signature so much even though i realize they're not in the same "league" as some of the other headphones which I have ranked these above. Although, that's completely irrelevant for me as when it comes to pure enjoyment of music, these rank as high as anything I've ever heard)
2. SRH840
3. HD600
4. RS-1
5. K601
6. K701
7. K501
8. SR225
9. HFI-2200
10. K271
11. HD650
12. SR325
13. SR60
14. SRH240
15. SR80 
 
As for the top 5 headphones I've ever personally heard:
 
1. Omega 2 MKII- Blue Hawaii amp (hands down the best combo I've ever heard and there's little I wouldn't do to be able to afford it one day)
2. HE90/HEV90 "Orpheus"
3. T1

5. HD800

This will have a little funny order:
 
1. XB500          43 EUR - a little too much unbalanced, a bit excessive upper bass (starts roll-off from the +15dB amplitude lvl as late as 300Hz) and slightly too veiled highs, otherwise good
2. XB700          65 EUR - slight lack of mid/upper bass, a little too recessed mids, positional cues not optimal
3. M50           140 EUR - bad soundstage, slight lack of bass quantity for my taste (both deep & upper), slightly too much metallic/bright peak in the lower highs
4. HD212 Pro    47 EUR - slightly recessed midrange, bad sound quality, especially highs are quite stringent/bright/unnatural, bass lacks slight definition to it
5. D1100        123 EUR - too laid-back sounding for my liking, poor bass extension, very recessed midrange, poor highrange quality
6. K518 DJ       49 EUR - a bit lacking bass extension for my taste, slightly too dark sounding and poor soundstage "claustrophobic"
7. DT770 Pro   145 EUR - very unbalanced deep/upper bass ratio, recessed midrange, metallic/bright highs, "thin" sound, a bit too laid-back for my taste
 
Cheapest first, expensiest last. So much for price reflecting satisfaction eh.

2) AKG Q701, best for movies / gaming
3) Sennheiser HD650 - I really liked these cans but the LCD-2 is an improved hd650 for sure ( improved low's , mid's and highs )
4) Grado Sr80i - the one that started this obsession
5) Ultrasone HFI 780 - good closed can, akg's sound stage trumps its s-logic surround 
6) Grado GS1000 , too picky about source and often sibilant - terribly overpriced
7) Beyerdynamic DT 770 , IMO too much treble
8) Beyerdynamic DT 990 , sibilant and treble would often walk over the mid range

Well, I've owned about 4 pairs of K701 and K702's in my lifetime, so I guess this has to do a lot with it. I keep going back to them.
The treble is smoothing out a lot and I hope it gets better.

 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Just for fun, here are my favorites for gaming:
(I own all of them)
 
1) AKG K702
 
I originally put these as #2 (below the K601), but the extra treble, detail and clarity is so nice. When I want a more relaxing and laid back sound for gaming I'll use the K601.
The K601 has far better imaging, but a smaller soundstage and a warmer sound. I wasn't a fan of this for gaming until I got the E9 and later the (better) Headroom Micro Amp.
K601 has the more upfront sound. K702 feels like speakers at times.
 
2) AKG K601 (see above)
 
3) Sennheiser HD-598 (Mogami. It's sound cleared up a lot with it)
 
4) Sennheiser HD-650 (Mogami. Not enough detail, sound clarity or treble for gaming IMO)
 
5) AKG K240 Studio
 
6) Audio Technica ATH-AD700
The AD700 is better than the K240 studio for games, but I don't like the comfort and recessed mids.
 
7) Koss Pro DJ 100
 
Tons of detail and a fun and engaging sound, but not as clear as some of my more expensive headphones. For a $80 closed headphone it's hard to complain!
 
8) Beyer Dynamic DT-235 - super cheap headphone that's good for gaming. Far better when modded. I suggest Circumaural pads and mods to bring up the mids (I have a thread on that)

Hello everybody on this forum.  This is my first post, though I spend a lot of my time reading this forum.  I am not audio pro, but I am just going to rank my headphones according to my personal taste:
 
1)  Etymotic ER4P
2)  Sennheiser IE8 
3)  Audio Technica ATH M50
4)  Sennheiser MX980
5)  Monster Pro Copper
6)  Sennheiser HD595
7)  Sennheiser PX200
8)  Ultimate Ears Super FI 5 EB (like them only when on the mood for a lot of bass)
 
Currently anxiously waiting for my HD 25's and SM3's.  So maybe after getting these my ranking will change.

It's kinda hard with 3 and 4 because I like them about the same, but for very different reasons.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

First two are the best I've owned period.
 
1) HE-500
2) HE-4
3) FX67
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Koss Pro DJ 100 (in HD-497 shell to be open)
 
This thing is amazing when made open and with some decent pads and some tweaks to it's signature. When fully open the sound clarity really seems to improve. It's soundstage is HUGE now. Makes my HD-598 and K601 look like a snore fest. Open it's just a totally different headphone. Same signature, but just better. Too bad the HD-497 shell is so hard to find. When closed, there is no way this would be at #1 despite it being a favorite.
 
2) Sennheiser HD-598
 
The K601 has better sound quality as well as a better soundstage, but this one is just a bit more engaging for me and a little more fun to listen to. Without a recable, the K601 would be at #2. This is the headphone that made me sell off my HD-650. I never would have did this until I added a new cable (Mogami Starquad). The sound really clears up with a recable. I've tried 3 types and Mogami seems to be the best match.
 
3) AKG K601
 
I keep thinking the HD-598 has more forward mids, but specific music seems to bother me more with this headphone. I guess it's more picky about source files. I prefer this to the K702 by far and I just sold that.
 
4) KRK KNS-6400
 
Can a $99 headphone be perfect? Well, this is about as perfect as it gets. Tons of detail, a super clear sound, good bass, mids and well extended treble. They say you can't have everything, but this is close enough. The soundstage is also one of the best I've heard from a closed headphone other than the D2000. I actually prefer this to the KRK KNS-8400. One of the few studio monitors that's fun to listen to. Extremely comfortable too and I just upgraded mined to the 8400's memory foam pads. This has the most bass out of all my headphones. Weird.
 
With all these headphones I think I'm all set for quite awhile. I still want to get the Shure SRH-940 just to compare to my DJ100 and KNS-6400. It will take one heck of a headphone to dethrone the DJ100.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Maybe people should be posting the amps that they use with these headphones to rank them... its sort of an important part of the evaluation.  
 
My DT990's through my Bijou and my DT990's through my far inferior Total BitHead are two different animals.  I'm sure my 650's will be too.

Audeze LCD-2
After having the LCD-2 for almost a month I have come to the conclusion that any other headphones I have or heard were just pretending to be headphones. So I only have one on my list. If you think I am wrong dont tell me this is a time when ignorance is bliss. And after many years my wallet agrees with me. For me this is a headphone that does it all in a way no other has done before. I am finaly content with one girl and her name is Audeze no more whoring around for me. At last I can settle down live with just this one headphone and be more then content.
I always knew there could be only one.

2}Sony MDR-CD-870 Headphones----------I have had these forever. Took the pads off and washed them after 11 or so years. The sound is not perfect but very level on an eq curve, a little lacking in highs. These feel like an old pair of worn-out shoes. They are some of the lightest and best feeling headphones ever made. These are by far my most easy headphones to wear. They are nicer to wear than the Denon AH-D 7000 because they are light. They stay on your head too.
 

3}AKG k701 Headphones----------I own two pair. They are nice to play with certain types of music. Very level on an eq curve. Cool to own, Great to spend a day with once in a while. You kinda know they are on your head at times.
 
 
1}Denon AH-D 7000 Headphones----------Color and very boosted in bass, lower mids, highs. Great headroom, great for almost all music and movies. Works with a lot of amps, Feels like air on your head.

I use a Stello DP200 dac/pre/headphoneamplifier at home and my mobile dac/amplifier is a QED MB45 amplifier and Kingrex USB dac. DT770 and Denon also runs unamped from laptop or mp3 player.
 
1. Beyerdynamic T1. Best sounding dynamic headphones I've ever heard.
2. AKG K701. A little to light at the low frequencies but comfortable and with a big soundstage.
3. Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 32 ohm. Works excellent unamped on mobile gear and build for life. My most used headphones.
4. Denon AH-D301. I just have them but they are ok considering the price.

1. Beyer DT48 - Bass extension is weak, truly excellent mids, highs can be a tad sibilant. Very recording dependant and very honest. Sounds very plain, they dont try to impress you but are tremendously detailed and clear. Imaging is pinpoint but soundstage small.
2. Etymotic ER6i - Bass extends low and has decent impact, mids are detailed but a little plastic, highs are excellent and detailed. Good extension on both ends while remaining balanced and having good tonality. Great for the money. Only downside is the soundstage is in your head.
3. Beyer DT770 250 ohm - Bass is earthquake-like, sounds much like an actual sub with bass you can physically feel. Mids are recessed but smooth and fairly detailed. Highs are nice sounding. Wide soundstage for a closed phone
4. Bose IE - Bass extension is good but sounds muddy and bloated. The DT770 has more bass but is less bloated. Mids tonality is foggy sounding but detailed and somehow natural. Highs are practically non existant. But this headphone sounds very smooth and relaxing and is very musical. Not good for critical listening or accuracy but is perfect for casual listenting. They sound great to the average non audiophile.
5. Grado SR 125- Bass extension is okay but not great. Mids are great for electric guitar and metal, pretty natural. Highs are peircing. Nice airy soundstage, im used to closed headphones so yeah. These are great for rock and metal. But I just dont like the grado sound.
 
DT48 is not understood when heard, and Bose are not respected for their intended artificial sound. Just my opinion.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: Beyerdynamic DT48: ^^^ For the reasons above. Eyedrop described them as well as I could.
2: Realistic Pro 50: Pretty freakin groovy. Moreso than K240S's, which were crowned groovalizers. These probably aren't the same type RP50's that wualta loves though. Mine have MP radiators (I found out that there are also different versions of this. I found one with I think EP radiators. Sold for only $35. Lucky bastard.)
3: Smeggipucks: Best portable headphones I've ever heard. (Then again, I haven't heard the AT's, new Beyers, ED.8, HD25, Phiatons, or TMA-1. ) In all seriousness, fabulous speed, aurgasmic mids (for a portable), a bit bright (fixable, but I'm lazy) and bass goes surprisingly deep.
4: Monster Turbine Pro Coppers: They may be rather uninvolving and somewhat unrefined, but they do little wrong in an absolute sense. There really aren't many genres that this fails on.
5: AKG K271: These tend to be rather polarizing. I, for one, love them. They have superb mids, but lose out a bit on the extremes. Treble is a tad restrained, and bass needs more texture, but very good all around.
6: AKG K4: I'm going to be mean and not describe them in depth. Look for a pair for yourself. They're a miniatureized pair of K340's with more bass and restrained treble. Yes, they're worth looking for.
7: Monster Turbine Pro Gold: Just plain fun. They don't try to do any audiophile tricks unlike the Coppers, just create a creamy sound.
8: Audio Technica ATH-2: Orthodynamics from the 70's. They're colored to a fault, but still has some of the features I like in the Smeggipucks. I fixed the bass issues, but still a bit sloppy.
9: Beyerdynamic DT220: Not too much to say about them. They're a studio monitor from the 80's with typical studio monitor sound. Great mids, needs an amp. They're pretty good, but the K271's are a better.
Crap, I'm not even halfway done...
10: Koss Technician VFR: My holy grail of vintage Kosses. I restored them and mass damped them. These are really freakin bassy. Shame they aren't incredibly detailed. They sound decidedly V shaped, but the mids are surprisingly decent. At least not colored like the XB500's. (Totally not worth $30 on ecost...they sound rather atrocious for the price. *Flamesuit on*)
11: MEElectronics CC51: Very competent <$100 IEM's. Bassy, but less so than their previous creations. Mids take a step back, but not terrible. Treble is ever so slightly recessed.
12: Prodipe Pro800: See my thread for a better idea on the sound, but they make electronic amazing. Too bad they're freakin fragile.
13: Philips "The Stretch": I'll have a review up in a couple weeks. You'll just have to wait for that. 
14: Modded Koss Portapro: I removed the grill, replaced the grill with felt, and quarter modded the pads. The result is a darker than stock, but more refined sound. ...Yeah everyone knows how these sound. If you don't, go and buy a pair. They're cheap enough. 
15: eSmooth ES610BB: Modded, they sound like a bassier pair of Portapros with less refinement. Too bad shipping is so freakin high. Need to make a review for the eSmooth stuff soon.
16: eSmooth ES360EB: Very competent set of IEM's. If I didn't know any better, I'd think they were $50. I'll have a review up soon.
17: Koss KSC75: A brighter Portapro with a bit less detail and bass.
18: Brainwavz M1: Surprisingly good for $30. Smooth treble, tightish bass (could use some more detail, but these are $30), but unrefined mids.
19: Ultimate Ears Super.fi 4: Very mid-treble happy. Too bad they don't even do it right.
20: Brainwavz M3: Not as good as the CC51. Some bass issues, funky sounding mids. Heck, the M1's for half the price sound more natural.
21: eSmooth ES530: Bassy with unrefined mids and treble, but still very fun.
22: MEElectronics M31: Same deal as the ES530, but WAY too much bass for me. And mids are kinda sucky.
23: Phiaton PS20 NC: They'd probably sound awesome if they could fit in my ear. But what I heard was colored mids, uncontrolled bass, and bright treble. Very tip dependent. Still, they're a treat to listen to when I muster up the manliness to suck it up when they hurt.
24: MEElectronics M21: Very balanced, but also very boring.
25: iBuds: These aren't good, but don't deserve the trashing they get. They're decent.
26: MEElectronics M9: They were a revelation when MEE was a new company, but I'm glad to see that they've been improving their products. The M9's are super bassy and don't like when you turn it up loud.
27: Sony J10: Meh.
28: Sone E818: More Meh.
29: iWave XB500 clones: Comfy, but lack refinement of any kind, even when modded.
30: Sansa Buds: These DO NOT sound like HD650's... 
31: Duracell Earbuds: These make me want to stop listening to music...
 
I also want to note that I did not pay more than $60 for any of my over ear headphones. Heck, the first three cost less than $50. It most certainly is possible for good headphones to cost less than $100 if you look hard enough.
 
My amps/sources are a NaNite N2, Sony A726, Blackberry Tour, EMU 0204, and a Harman Kardon HK430. Yes, I'm pretty sure the HK430 is strong enough.

Well, to anyone who has not had the intense pleasure to hear these monstrosities, find the nearest chalk board. Find Edward Scissorhands. Tell him to scrape the board. Now cover your ears with a blanket. Tell him to scrape the board again. That's how they sound. I didn't think it was possible to make something that bad.

another data point. I would listen to my MS1is more than my Denon D5000s.
 
then I got an RS2 and sold the Denons (and the MS1is).
 
obviously, there will be some people who feel the exact opposite but I got hooked on that grado sound.

1. Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 (First set of anything even vaguely resembling audiophile cans that I've owned, and I'm not disappointed. Imaging is nothing short of excellent!)
 
2. Sansui SS-20 (A hand-me-down from my stepfather. Sound quality seems okay, and the volume dials can be used to filter out that annoying low-level noise some sources have at any volume setting on the source side, but they're heavy and not too comfortable thanks to the hardened pleather pads that could use some replacements, probably hand-made.
 
3. Sony MDR-CD180 (Picked these up at a yard sale for a few bucks because they were fairly small and VERY comfortable, if not particularly astounding in sound quality. Unfortunately, the shaft that holds the left earcup/driver to the headband broke, and I'm not sure how much longer they'll stay together just from being glued in place. Were it not for that, I'd rank them above the SS-20 in preference simply because of the comfort and lightness of the things.)
 
No, I don't own very many headphones and haven't heard many high-end ones, but if I could just get my hands on a nice electrostatic setup to try out...

I forgot to update my post in this thread, heh...doesn't reflect that I finally got those Stax Lambdas I wanted, and they're every bit what I was hoping for, leaving the AD700s in a distant second and the SS-20s in an even more distant third.
 
You'd expect that for a setup at least three times the price, but there are stories of people paying up significantly more for something and not really liking it in spite of that. (Then again, some people just don't like the AD700s period and probably aren't surprised that I'd want to replace them.)

Sorry, not enough amps. 
 


True. (Will take them another 2 days or so to arrive from Japan.)
 
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

 


I suppose constantly swapping headphones between the existing amps would be impractical?
 
Speaking of which, I'll have to find a local headphone meet with a normal bias Stax direct-drive amp eventually, to find if the sound improves any over my current old receiver + SRD-7/SB approach. If anything, I'd at least like to consolidate things a bit; receivers take up more computer desk space than I'd like, and most of their extra functions are useless if I'm only using the power amp section.
 
What's your take on SRM-series direct-drive amps vs. SRD-series transformer boxes paired with a speaker power amp?

@namelessPFG: Sonically and from the ease of handling I prefer amps over adapters. Then again, I only have two relatively modest power amps. An Accuphase or McIntosh might be able to change my mind.

So uh, I heard you like Shures? :P
I just got the SRH840s today, and I'd revise my list as follows:
1) Grado SR225s - They're uncomfortable but damn are they fun to listen to.
2) SRH840s - Every complaint I had about the 440s (Pads, Headband) disappeared and they're so much more detailed.
3) SRH440s - Even slightly uncomfortable, they're a damn fine pair of cans for the cost, also they were my first "good" cans so there's that.
4) Ultrasone HFi-580s - You know the more I listen to these honestly the less I like them. They have such a niche sound to me now compared to my other sets. They're great for mau5 & Daft Punk, some hip hop, but honestly I think at this point I even prefer the Grados for thing like Jay-Z. This pair might end up on sale soon.

Made a small revision. HD-598 has gone past the K501, but only after recabling it with an HD-650 cable. What the heck?! To me it sounds better than the Mogami, Canare and Belden. Weird.
HD-598 is just a little more musical/fun to listen to. Still love the K501 though, especially the soundstage. It's not going anywhere EVER. Not a fan of the HD-598 stock cable at all.
 
 
DJ100 and 6400 are my primary portable headphones. Both are very different, but DJ100 is a lot more fun to listen to due to it's bass. DJ100 and HD-598 have my favorite sound signatures.
HD-598 fans may like the DJ100. I hope so.

There is no longer spare drivers around. Sony has stopped manufacturing parts for R10 long ago so kinda risky to keep them. Once the driver fails, $5000 will just go down the drain.

Still a low/barely midfi guy. I will be moving up one day.
M50 - Although the sound stage and detail is overall better in the AD700, I think the tonal balance is better in the M50s and they just shine much better for so many more genres than the AD700. They still arent the "fun" sound I was looking for but they're still awesome.
AD700 - Absolutely gorgeous for my classical, choral, and more acoustic music. The M50s though have brough about a distinct dissatisfication with them when it comes to certain genres. I just cant listen to heavier rock and electronic stuff from the much without wanting to switch to the M50s. Good can but I just think I am finally starting to get why some people prefer to use them only for specific tasks. They are wonderful for movies though, I can say that.
Koss Portapro - Still one of the best ways to get into the world of headphones. My first uograde from ibuds and they are just fun to listen to and rock out on once in a blue moon.

Alessandro MS1i Jaben woody mod (GS pads): Comfy and relatively lightweight.. A bit bright but sounds really good with jazz and acoustic, even classical. Although grainier and less refined than my HFI680 the ms1i is much more musical and warm.
 
Grado SR60i (Filter removed, Quarter mod): Lightweight. Sounds awesome with my rock and metal.. less refined than ms1i and HFI680 but much more engaging and fun, especially for agressive music. And it still sound good with acoustic and jazz, such a versatile headphone. Looking forward to mod this with Jaben AluMod
 
Ultrasone HFI680 (stock): closed, full size but pretty portable. Clear and almost grainless sound. Flat and almost neutral. definitely bright and a little in the cold side. Very good for instrumental music (jazz, blues, classical, acoustic) but not so good with music with vocal, because the vocal is just bland and flat. not laidback nor too forward but just not so engaging.
 
Yamaha HP50A Ortho(recabled): still needs a little bit modification on damping.. good impact and transients, great tonal balanced and a little emphasis on the mid but still needs refinement.
 
AKG K412p (stock):  Sounds really fun and musical, great tonal balanced.. I like it, but the right driver is problematic, it seems like the diaphragm is damaged. And they are discontinued.. damnit

My last ranking :
 
1 - Senn  HD595
2 - Shure SRH940
3 - akg K317
4 - senn IE7
5 - koss ksc75
 
It might be unfair to rank the hd595 above the srh940, but I  just find the srh940  more fatiguing. In fact, I  just can't relax while using the srh940, no matter eq, dsp trick, music. I  rank the k317 above the senn IE7, because I  found them quite impressive  for the price.
They have less bass than the senn IE7, but I  just like them better for a big range of music. Perhaps the k317 sound sometimes "plasticky" , but most of the times I  love their sound signature.  Finally the ksc75 is quite impressive, considering that I  only got them for 15$, and I'd say that they are "perfect" for non critical listening. I  might have ended my audiophile quest, if I  bought them first.

1. Beyerdynamic DT-990
I love the dynamic sound of these cans.
2. Audio Technica ATH-M50
Use for metal, and Spotify through my mobile. Kind of like the slightly congested and tight sound of these cans. Easy on the ears.
3. Audio Technica ATH-AD700
Would rank higher if they had a tad more punch. I love their big airy soundstage.
4. Sony MDR-CD580
Never really use them, but they sound nice.
5. AKG K-450
Use when travelling to work, and at work.
6. Koss Porta Pro
My seven year old use them for listening to Kiss, Misfits and Accept through his mp3 player. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

1. Sennheiser HD800
This is just perfection to my ears. Huge soundstage makes for a speaker-ish experience. Detail is out of this world.
 
2. Etymotic ER4S
Perfection minus the soundstage of the HD800. No wonder Etymotic still hasn't technically changed these since their introduction in 1991. Perfection can't be improved anyway. Who needs multiple drivers?
 
3. Grado RS1i
While they might not be technically on the same level as an HD800, their intimate and liquid sound it just so pleasing to listen to. For female vocals these are absolutely the best I've heard.
 
4.Ultrasone Pro 900
These don't sound like closed headphones at all. Their soundstage is comparable to that of an HD600 and has lots of airiness to it. The bass is absolutely amazing. It has so much weight and punch to it, yet it remains tightly controlled. For electronic music these are monsters.
 
5. Sennheiser HD25-1 II
Very handy to have around as an all purpose headphone. Great for on the go and they'll last you a lifetime. They have an aggressiveness to the sound without being fatiguing.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. HD650
Tesla T1 is better in many aspects, but I rank here by my own overall preference. I yet to hear HD800 and something whispers me it will replace HD650.
 
2. RE272
Replaced ER-4S here. Who needs BA? 
 
3. TM5
Actually I do not have it in my possessions now, it was lost and I am awaiting for new one with patience. I think this meets OP requirements.
 
4. PortaGold (deep modded PortaPro)
Grado-alike sound plus bass and soundstage, comfortable while tenacious grip, strong build, very light.
 
5. MDR-Q68LW
Nice for streets causal listening. Cheap, small, light, comfortable, fits well under winter hat. Fast clear sound. Retractable cords are ingenious.

1) Koss Pro DJ 100
 
After nearly two years of use, this headphone I still love. I'm using it with a Mogami 2893 cable and some M50 pads. It has my near perfect sound signature. I've yet to find any headphone that sound similar. The mids of the K400 come close, but are much too forward. Has some similarities to the Grado SR-225i minus the treble and with extra bass. Sadly this headphone makes it often hard to get the sound right. Ok, it's not technically as good as my other headphones, but it's sound is addicting.
 
2) AKG Q701
 
This surpasses my old K501, K601 AND HD-598. Previously I did prefer the K501/K601 over my old K702. Apparently they're supposed to be the same right?! After using this nearly non-stop for a month I have zero complaints about this headphone. Well, I do hate the green thread and cable!
 
3) HD-598
 
It hasn't been the same in awhile. I need to spend some more time listening to this. When recabled I do prefer this to the K501 and K601 (which are favorites)
 
4) AKG K601
 
2nd favorite gaming headphone, but compared to the K501 seems less balanced somehow. This headphone isn't ever going anywhere.
 
5) AKG K240 Studio
 
Another I'll never sell. Love the extra bass on these and I'm using my pair with some Beyer leather pads. Perfect budget headphone that's often overlooked.
 
Not sure:
 
K400
 
This one has some very good mids, but with my setup it has very fatiguing mids. I should replace it's cable with a Mogami one. Very bass light until you add K601 pads
 
SR-325is
 
Not sure about this one yet. Not too thrilled with it yet, but I'll keep listening. I was impressed with the SR-225i I recently had before upgrading to this. With my DJ100 back to it's old self, this hasn't been used much.

 I guess what I'm asking is, in what way do you find the Rev 1 superior to the Rev 2?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Ohh. I thought i made a whole comparison on the rev.1&2 thing. Basically, same as googleli. Creamier liquid mids, easier to listen to. relaxed treble. And foam band is more comfortable for me. I find my rev.1 has more bass weight than 2.

I’ve gone through a whole bunch of headphones the last year. Here’s my current lineup (I’m happy with all of them) and my rankings for whatever it’s worth
 
Home listening headphones
 
1. Sennhesier HD800. It provides the best, most expansive soundstage and is incredibly quick and detailed. With the right amp, I even feel the bass kicking hard and the overall tonality does not seem overly bright to me (a little bright, but not enough for me to think it detracts from the music). Before I got these, I was concerned I would find them dull, but that hasn’t been my experience at all. I’m always looking forward to putting these on.
 
2. Denon D7000. I just got these in a trade. I think they’re pretty amazing and a huge step up over an old stock D5000 I had before. The mids are not nearly as recessed as the D5000. The bass impact is boosted a bit which makes them not exactly neutral but they are my go to cans for any rap or hip hop. They’re more fun than the HD800 with some music but I prefer the airiness and balance of the HD800 most of the time.
 
3. Grado RS1 (older buttoned model). I got some flats which help bring the bass out a bit. I still love that forward presentation of the Grados and these provide a very immediate experience with rock that the other two cans can’t provide. I don’t think these are as good as the other two for a wide variety of genres but there are times listening to acoustic guitar or some guitar driven rock when I want to feel like I’m in the front row and these do that better than anything else I own.
 
Portable headphones
 
1. Grado GR10. I upgraded from the GR8 recently and like these just a little bit more treble extension. I gave up on IEMs a couple years ago as every model I tried just felt a little too big or awkward in my ears (W3, triple fi 10, ADDIEM) as I have pretty small ear canals. Plus when I moved to cans, I noticed an open and airiness to songs that those older IEMs didn’t quite have. I then tried some portable on ear cans this fall but I felt they were all too cumbersome to carry around and the sound always felt too congested. Well, these little Grado IEMs fix both those issues. the bodies are absolutely tiny and light. And with the small ear tips, I can’t feel them in my head at all. And they provide a sound similar to other open air Grados that I’ve used. They’re bass light, which is my one small issue I have with them but comfort and that Grado-style presentation makes them keepers.
 
2. Grado SR-60i. I got these as a cheaper, “beater” headphone that I don’t need to worry about coddling. I don’t wear them around the street but I take them on trips if I’ll be in a hotel for a while and want to listen to some music inside. I still love the grado signature sound and these are a nice cheap way to get into it.

I also have Etymotic ER6i which I probably prefer the sound of more than the Grado, but I generally prefer full sized over IEM. It was a tough choice for the AD900 and HFI-780... I know I like the AD900 more and it very quickly became my go-to choice but, when I'm in the right mood, the HFI-780 just seems like a lot more fun to listen to.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



You ranked the Senns higher than the HF2's so something must the PX100's be doing to make better than the Grados. Otherwise I don't understand the thinking behind your ranking.
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I think he's saying there's a realistically better headphone and then there's the headphone he prefers. It sounds like he's saying the HF2's should be the better headphone, but he still personally prefers the PX100.

Nothing here is hard to understand, It's just a metter of personal preference. The HF2 definitely has much better sound quality, The reason why I ranked it after PX100 is because I slightly prefer the sound signiture of the PX100, to be more specific, the HF2 has quite tamed high frequency (lack of treble sparkle) and odd soundstage (intimate grado sound but the mids is too distant to my liking) which I don't like, PX100 sounds more natrual to me. Sound signitrue is a more important aspect than sound quality when I consider whether I like a headphone or not. If you have been around here long enough, you must have seen some head-fiers said that they prefer a $300 headphone to a $1000+ flagship.
 
As you can see their ranking (#7, #8), it's not hard to come to a conclusion that both headphones are not my favorite, so I think any further discussion is not nessisary.

Absolutely in love with the CD900ST's. Probably the best mids I've ever heard in a headphone, at any price range. Really, there's not much they do bad. Extension on either end of the spectrum could be better, but I really don't have to much of a problem with that.
 
The DT 770 Pro's are a sweet, fun can. Really like them for games and movies, mainly because they are so damn comfortable, and have a nice soundstage.

They were a christmas gift from my beloved mother, this past holiday. It would be just beastly of me to sell them off. Besides, they're rugged and have decent isolation, so they're nice to take out into public when I want headphones but don't want to risk a nicer product to the dangers of the outside world.

You like sennheiser don't you? Time for you to experiment!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I do like Sennheiser. But there's another reason aswell. The prices i have here. Sennheiser has outstanding prices. As low as on Amazon, sometimes even lower. On the contrary a pair of ATH-AD700 costs $250. 
 
Another one with more reasonable prices is Grado, with $135 for SR80i.
Beyerdynamics and Ultrasone are also expensive just like Audio Technicas.
 
Before deciding on HD 598 i wanted to try something else. I looked at AD700 and AD900, DT770 PRO, HFI-580, ATH-M50 and all of them were more than HD 598 and more than my maximum budget. Having only the SR80i as an alternative, while curoius to own a Grado, i feared for the comfort too much and stayed with Sennheiser once again.
 
I started to experiment with the Panasonics, and i hope in the future to own some of the other good brands.

As for your question about the DJ100. No mods, but M50 pads.
 
Yes, requires a good amp/dac and lots of burn in. It's my opinion and preferences. It's not a headphone for everyone.
 
Maybe you should review them if you don't like them. IMO it sounds much better than any other $80 headphone.
 
For me this isn't simply a list of what sounds technically the best, but a combination of everything.
 
The DJ100 is my "fun" headphone for when I need a little extra bass and some forward mids.

There is a lot of room between 1 and 2. The Denons are excellent. I should have saved the money I spent on all of the others and bought the Denons at the beginning. But that is not how this hobby works. The Beats have a slight edge the XB 700s because they travel well, and that is the sole use of them. The JVC was a terrific value at under $40.

They let me keep them, I sold them as I didn't have an amplifier close to powerful enough, I was going to make another thread hopefully giving HiFiMAN good PR for it but after the last thread, probably not a good idea.

This isn't really fair, my "kids" have different personalities and different strengths.
1.) Modded D7000s (among the most musical headphones I've ever heard, simply brilliant in almost every way)
2. tie) Rastapants (take 1 part HE-500 and 2 parts HE-400, very good stuff here)
2. tie) AKG Q701s (best open headphone value I've found)
4.) Modded D2000s (not keeping them, they're going to my dad for his birthday)
5.) V-MODA V-80s (my favorite on-ear portables)

I understand the K240s, good stuff and bang for the buck, but... the D7000 must be quite cheap in your country to beat the LCDII in price/performance.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


well, I am sorry if that makes some audez'e owners unhappy, but I do rate them on several aspect instead of just the sound quality. The k240s like you said, at 99 it really excels in its category, the d7000 with the deal posted here, at less than 600$, is really a strong contender versus the 1000 dollars lcd-2. especially on the comfort side. don't get me wrong, I like the lcd-2 a lot, but d7000 has a greater value at 600

You know, I kept on seeing that when I joined in October and could never figure out why people keep on saying it.  I was completely sure that the M-50s were the perfect headphones for me and that I would not be buying amps, dacs, or another pair of headphones.

I expect things to change once I can get my mits on the Philips Fidelio L1's once they are available to buy in my country. If not completely happy I may try the Beyer DT990 Pro's. I'm also pondering getting a DAC amp.

I didn't start from the M50's though. I entered the world of audiophillia (without knowing the existence of Head-fi.org so it was pure coincidence) with the UE Super.fi 5 Pro coming from a pair of Panasonic RP-DJ600 so I did a massive jump. I still remember those Super.fi 5 Pro, the first time I heard those IEM's it was like entering a world full of colours and life. Every music that I threw sounded engaging and absolutely fun. I miss my Super.fi 5 Pro. :(

Interesting listing.  I can see the Ultrasones besting the open cans due to bass (and some people just love that S-Logic), but putting the AD900 ahead of the Q701 is intriguing to me.  What do you like better about the A-T?  And if the HFI 580 didn't make the top 4, what put it ahead of your MS1?  Maybe default because the Alessandro just wasn't your cup of tea, whereas the 580 while not a technical marvel had the sound you like?

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I know im gonna get bashed for saying this but i dont have an amp for the Q701 just yet - just got them a few days ago. I will be getting one in the near future but as of now i'll be enjoying them without one. As you may have guessed running the Q701 unamped will sounds rather thin this was pretty much the reason i ranked the ad900 above it. As for the 580's not making the top 4, it was due to lack of comfort otherwise it would've been ranked 3rd (cause i love me them ultrasones =D). The Alessandro is actually my "go to" cans when im not at my desk at home so i do like them but imo it is outclassed (by very little) by the others thus it was last. Overall they are not too far from one another but since i had to rank them i put them in that order.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


i can send you the pics, but the headphones look the same from the outside and even if you remove the earcups, i also mantained the ability to daisychain the phones.
Also, i didn't take any photo of the process, because i did it at my father's and at that time i sent my iphone to apple for repair, and my father just has some old analog cameras with no film inside... 
It wasn't that difficult, in fact the most difficult part was getting the akg drivers out of the 141s without damaging them...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

No I have not heard them but cool that you thought to modify them.  Did you mean to order fakes for that purpose...or what happened?

Edited by jjanuary - 2/29/12 at 5:42pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 

Yeah i ordered fakes on purpose, mainly because some people on some forums said they sounded the same as the originals, and they did! But their sound just got very boring and bass and bass and bass and only bass, so i decided to recycle my dad's old 141s, which already had a broken headband and a dent in the left driver, which was unfixable if not bu opening the phones up.
.so i thought why not? And i just took out the "original" drivers, milled the internals a bit with a dremel and hot glued the akg drivers inside :)

4) SR125
 
770 just has a very engaging sound for a wide range of music.  The 598 is better for classical / female vocals, and it is definitely clearer, just not as forward with their sound, too airy at times.  When you want to lay back, relax, and listen the 598s are great but I usually listen while typing on here.  540 beats 125 just because the 125 make me have awful pain after an hour, bearable up until then but after an hour it's awful.  I wear glasses too so that doesn't help.

Going from a HD-555 to a PRO 2900 is quiite some difference in bass impact
 
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



The HD-555's kind of kicked off everything for me.  I've had the DJ1's for many years but for some reason (possibly source, don't remember what I used to listen to them with when I first got them) I never used to appreciate them as much as I do now.  While those were sitting forgotten on a shelf last May I saw that Amazon was having a sale on the Sennheisers for $85.  I knew Sennheiser had a good reputation and after some research and reviews (also how I found Head-Fi) I decided to try them out.  I was amazed at detail and soundstage of them (especially compared to the Bose on-ear headset I had been using for listening at work) but the one thing I was never really happy about with them was the bass.  
 
More research here led to a FiiO e7 so I could get decent audio out of my work PC and I thought the bass boost would be enough to get the 555's sound where I wanted.  Turns out I might be a bit of a basshead because while that helped it definitely wasn't enough.  I had started listening to the DJ1's more on the e7 and realizing I never gave them the credit they deserved, they couldn't touch the 555's soundstage though.  Browsing Ultrasone's site one night I saw that the HFI-2400's were an open design and after checking the price on Amazon I just pulled the trigger right then based on my experience with the DJ1's and the open 555's.  Absolutely loved those, so much so that while researching the PRO-900's (the legendary bass they seem to be known for had me intrigued) I found the thread on the PRO-2900's and struggled for a month before finally giving in to the inevitable and ordering them, fearing the e7 might not be enough to do them justice and wanting some headroom for possible future headphones I ordered the e9 as well.  
 
I've only had the 2900's for two days, should be fun experiencing the changes as they burn in.  From others impressions I'm expecting they will only get better over time, the bass is already glorious.  I'm very happy with the equipment I have right now, the only thing I could see getting anytime soon is the FiiO e17 to replace the e7 (I listen a lot at work so the ability to use it at home docked in the e9 and as the all-in-one solution at work is important to me and something I get a lot of use out of currently with the e7).  Needless to say there's quite a few mods my truck won't be getting this summer that paid for headphones instead but I don't regret that choice at all.

I really do like the Grados, but I find them so uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time that the Monster Turbine Pro Coppers just become my default phones ... but they are really fantastic, and a great low end for IEMs.

Current list of what I own:
 
1. Sony MDR-7506
2. Grado SR80i
3. Panasonic HTF600-S
4. V-Moda M80
5. Audio Technica ATH-M50
6. Astro Gaming a30
 
 
It was harder than I thought to rank them because some of them are fairly genre-specific.
 
For example, I only use my SR80s with rock, acoustic, metal type music, and not at all for rap, hip hop, dubstep. Surprisingly they do sound really good with 70s soul music despite the fact that bass isn't one of their strong suits. They did really well with Otis Redding and Al Green and provided a surprisingly full, warm sound.
 
The Pannys are really only used for hip-hop and dubstep, because I don't really care for their sound with most other genres of music. However, the bass they provide makes them really fun for the genres that I mentioned.
 
The Astros have been banished to the "gaming-only" realm and I really only use them when I want to chat over XBox Live. For single player games I tend to use my Sonys because they sound better and I don' t need a mic in that case.
 
I have a set of HD650s and a Fiio E9 on the way, so pretty soon I can see that list being 1 item long. :)

But, if I could only own one headphone and it came down to the HD800 or T1, I'd take the T1s for their versatility with pretty much every genre of music I throw at them.

Gaming headphones (NOT RANKED FOR MUSIC!!):
 
AKG Q701 (stock cable)
AKG K601 (totally underrated headphone. I'd take this over the regular K701/K702)
Sennheiser HD-600 (DHC cable only. Disliked it stock)
Sennheiser HD-598 (ca-0363 recable. Cheap wire)
KRK KNS-8400 (too revealing of low quality soundtracks! Lots of treble, but not too ear piercing)
Koss Pro DJ 100 with M50 pads
KRK KNS-6400 (slightly less clear than 8400. Less treble than 8400 and more mid-bass. Smaller soundstage)
Koss A/250 (almost too much treble. Weird signature. Nice soundstage, Detail monster!!)
Audio Technica ATH-AD300 (I'm a huge fan of it's signature. Not like AD700. Kind of warm, but sound clarity is just good, not great)
AKG K240 Studio
Audio Technica ATH-AD700 (not balanced sounding. Don't like it's piercing treble. Massive soundstage)
Panasonic HTF-600 (modded to reduce bass. Sound clarity is average. Soundstage is quite good!)
 
If I had to pick two favorites, they'd be the Q701 and KRK KNS-8400. I don't use the KNS-8400 enough because it's not open.
My DJ100 with it's CA-0363 cable, M50 pads and mods has a soundstage the size of a semi-open headphone with specific games.
Level of detail is comparable to the KRK KNS-8400.
 
The Turtlebeach Earforce DSS (and probably Mixamp) can't drive the KRK KNS-8400 or DJ100 very well. Too little volume. Weird.
I use them all of them with an amp.

Does science tell you that he couldn't have heard a difference or he couldn't have thought he heard a difference?
 
If it doesn't disprove the latter then his statement is not invalidated, it's just not applicable to others.
 
This thread is people ranking their own headphones - if you assumed objective conclusions were to be drawn, you were sadly misinformed.  And yes, in this subforum your post was trolling.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Good for you. Gotta love the science guys. You know those people who use their $50 Radio Shack speakers with two brands of dollar store wire and claim they hear no difference and never will.
I'd be extremely surprised if any of these so called "science guys" actually TRIED to prove theirselves wrong. That's what I did and love to do.
 
I mean seriously, do they even have any experience with using and testing wire and actually recabling headphones and listening to the resulting sound? Very few. I think I heard one do this once and he recabled his K702 with a Cardas cable and was driving it from a Nano.
You can even recable a KSC75 with Mogami and hear a difference.
 
If what you say is true, that would be you saying you've tried the DHC cable with the HD-600. You haven't. 
 
I think the issue is that the stock HD-600 cable is low quality garbage. The quality is about as high as those free RCA cables you get with a DVD player. That would explain a lot. There is no reason a $20 recable won't fix the HD-600 issues. It just has to be a specific type of cable with a low capacitance such as Belden or the DHC. Even a Cat6 recable would be better than stock!
 
Here's another fun experiment for the science guys. Take the HD-650 cable and solder it onto a known bright sounding headphone and see what you get. If that isn't enough proof, then I don't know what is...
 
I think the HD-600 is the only headphone I ever had I actually ONLY like with a new cable. I can't explain that one. HD-600 with stock cable is a complete snore fest to me. Anemic mids and poor sub-bass.
 
You can actually fix it's issues by giving the driver less air and using the HD-580 grills. Even closing it off. There's a thread about this from MarkL from 2001, but they all thought he was crazy or something, but he was right.
 
Yes, all that was trolling too. It's fun!

Indeed, good for me, and I'm glad you had you share of fun.
 
But seriously, cables differ in resistance... and looks. There is nothing more to it. Measure both, and unless there are two resistors soldered somewhere inside (or the cord is way too long), there shouldn't be a huge difference in ohm. If they are close or identical, they sound the same. If the resistance differs quite a bit, like a 75 Ohm-adapter-cord people use on the ETY ER-4P to convert them to Er-4S, it actually sounds quite a bit different... you can measure these results and reproduce them with ease.
 
 

 
But I doubt that the Kardas cable and the K701 stock cable differ more than 1 or 2 ohm, which is a difference most drivers in a series differ from each other...
If you want to change a headphone, change the pads and the dampening. These two aspekts change the sound and produce a measureable (existing) difference in SQ.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Are you trying to preach to me?  I've done a enough recables to trust my own ears. And I thought I was bad. I don't think i've ever proclaimed my experience are facts.
If you haven't tried over half a dozen varieties of wires and headphones, then you haven't really tried hard enough! Many, many wires do sound the same. I've never been this fortunate and I wish this was the case.
Have you tried Canare? It's a high capacitance wire and it will turn any of your very warm headphones into a muddy mess. It seems this has been my experience with the 598, Sextett, DJ100 and HD-650.
 
If you go to any forum for people who runs studios, it's pretty common knowledge that a lower capacitance wire (Belden/DHC) will sound brighter than one with a higher capacitance (Mogami/Canare).
People say there is no way the high end could be effected on such a short length of cable, but it sure doesn't seem that way.
 
What's interesting is that the wrong wire can ruin a headphone's signature. Try the Double Helix or Belden 1192A with the HD-598. It makes the mids too far forward and fatiguing. This is after a week of use. I switched back and it was perfect.
 
My idea as to why cables changed the sound was A) higher quality copper B) thickness of wire and C) Capacitance (shouldn't matter with short runs, but is there proof of this?). Could be a combination of many things.
 
SOME headphones don't change much with a recable.
 
BTW there was someone on here that had actual measurements of silver wire making a difference with the HD-650. People seemed to not want to believe it. That's silver and not plain old copper though.
 
For a cable to actually make a difference, why does it have to change the signature? This I don't get. You can often retain the signature and just clear up the sound and make a headphone more detailed. I kept the same signature with my 598 recable, which is what I wanted.
 
One thing i've noticed is that without a very revealing DAC/Amp, it's much harder to determine the difference between cables. Don't ask me why.
 
It seems to me that non-believers of cheap wire might not have tried enough recables, different types of wire or are just trying it with Speakers. I can't hear a difference with speakers and interconnects are a lot tougher.
 
I don't care if someone believes it's all non-sense, but some people are just so dead-set in their beliefs and refuse to even try new things. I actually was one of those who believed wires made no difference at all..probably about 4 years until I recabled my KSC75.
 
I've probably recabled a dozen headphones with all different sorts of wires and none of them retained the headphone's natural signature. Maybe the CA-0363 with the HD-598 and DJ100, but that's about it.
I would say the biggest difference was in the level of detail and how bright or warm a headphone was. Soundstage is effect too, but's probably due to the change in treble.
 
Here is one last question someone can answer for me. Why does a lower capacitance wire such as DHC appear louder at the same volume level than a stock cable? It's measurable with a sound meter. It's almost like someone cranked up my volume. No kidding.
Thought this was my imagination at first..

You should take that discussion to the sound science and this tread: 
 http://www.head-fi.org/t/572588/audiophile-cables-an-interesting-question/240#post_8054940 
 I have seen some absolutely ridiculous and unwise recommendation regarding cables on this forum. Like spending 500-1000 on a HD-650 cable or even more on a power cord. 
 I think this makes the hobby and this forum look bad in generall. I'm not closed to the small but important effect certain cables possibly can have on sound however, but within reason.

Well, tdockweiler never suggested to spend insane amount in cable, he mostly defend that some headphones comes with bad cables, and should be recabled. Frankly, I  don't know, once I've made this easy experience:
I  used  a cheap koss vc20 (volume adjuster), between headphone & source.
The koss vc20 is basically just an adjustable resistance, and I've noticed it was affecting the treble.
And I  didn't have to recable anything

Personally, I have a really hard time ranking my headphones these days, as my music tastes have expanded and my sound preferences are not as specific as they used to be, so that I can now accept and appreciate a wider range of sound signatures. I am now also of the opinion that technical ability is more difficult to evaluate than many think with all the biases that we have. All I can say is that Hifiman HE-500 seems to be the most technically capable in most cases, but not always with Beyers DT880 600 Ohm competing very well with them in some ways. Overall, the HE-500 seems to be my current favorite though and the best headphone I owned overall, followed by the DT880 600 Ohm and UE600 tying for second place and RE262 usually coming up third. I don't really listen to the rest of the 'phones I own anymore, so I don't feel like ranking them, but my modded HD555 is still a solid 'phone to me and KSC75 never fails to surprise me for its performance ratio and sounds more fun the the technically superior, but somewhat boring HD555. The Mb Quarts are good for closed cans, but not as enjoyable as KSC75 or HD555 to my ears. Oh, and the RE0s - well, they broke again.  The build quality is awful on them and I won't buy them anymore. If I was to rate their sound though, I would place them slightly below RE262 overall and perhaps on par in some cases as they have very different sound signatures.

Had to answer this one question as well, as giving  a comment.
I will stop preaching in this thread, I'm sorry I started to spread the word. I'll continue to post if a major change in my headphone repository happens. Till than I'll keep shut.
Sometimes I have this urge to change the world. Zetsubou****a! The world which still believes the earh is flat has left me in despair.
 


less resistance, in ohm = louder... the higher the basic resistance of the driver, the less noticable. (72ohm can is more affected  vs a 600ohm can) But due to regular cables measuring less than 1ohm, the change in volume should be around 1% if the new cord has less resistance. (if more due to resistors, (see the etymotic example in the previous post) the change in SQ and volume is quite audible.)

 

What I said in a nutshell

I feel that UE600 sounds more natural with better timbre accuracy, especially in the midrange. The highs are somewhat more refined on RE262 and perhaps more extended, but sound a little metallic compared to UE600. UE600 is just a tad peaky in the treble at times though, bt only with very few recordings, so I can forgive this easily. The bass is great on both and RE262 may have an edge in detail, but UE600 offers a more satisfying punchy while maintaining great quality. Dynamic range is better on RE262, but UE600 is still fine this respect. Soundstage sounds more 3 dimensional to me on the UEs with stronger imaging than on RE262s. Overall, I give the edge to UE600, but RE262 does sound better with some music and will undoubtedly fit many people's tastes better due to a smoother, more rounded sound vs. dryer, more precise sound of the UEs that reveals recording flaws more readily.

Sold my shure se535's today. They will be missed
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Shure Srh940
2) Senn HD598 (they're technically my brothers, but I've listened to them enough to know where they rank)
3) Samson Sr850
4) UE 200
5) Senn HD201
But I do feel that of these, the 940's and HD598's are the only pair I have worth listening to.
And that the others are only there because I can't be bothered selling them.

From what I like the most to least. Not what technically has the best sound.
Science dorks can ignore this post or go whine about it elsewhere.
 
1) Koss Pro DJ 100 (M50 pads)
I just love it's fun and engaging signature. Seems to do everything right and it's cheap. I'd say I especially love it for it's vocals.
 
2) AKG Q701 / KRK KNS-8400
If I had to only keep one, I couldn't choose. Maybe Q701 since it's open.
 
3) Sennheiser HD-600
dislike it and bores me to death with stock cable (wonder why?). On DHC it's just as fun and musical as the HD-598. Better sub-bass, more forward upper mids and more treble. Kind of too warm for me though, but clearer than stock. With a decent cable, this is so much better. Probably needs a low capacitance wire for it to sound good to ME ($1/foot. I suggest Belden 1192A). Right now it's almost as detailed as my Q701(!!!)
 
BTW with stock cables I prefer the HD-580 over the HD-600!! It has better bass and sounds clearer. Slightly more forward upper mids also. More treble detail (yes, I said it). I know it uses the same driver.
 
3) Sennheiser HD-598
Tied with the HD-600, but only for now. Without a cheapy cable upgrade on the HD-600, this would rank higher. It's very musical and fun. Has a huge soundstage that's larger than that of the HD-600. Not as warm as the HD-600, but that's a plus for me.
 
4) AKG K601
This one I'll never sell. Seems to do everything right and is often fuller sounding than the Q701. A lot warmer too, but not as warm as the HD-600. Makes a perfect gaming headphone. BTW I'd rank this higher than a K702 for sure. Without a recable the HD-598 would rank lower than the K601. My HD-598 recable cost me under $5.
 
5) KRK KNS-6400
 
6) AKG K240 Studio (almost never use this)
 
7) Audio Technica ATH-AD300
Surprised at how good this was for the $35 I paid! Much more bass and fuller sounding mids than the AD700 and it sounds more natural. A lot less treble and smaller soundstage. IMO it's worth $75.
 
8) Superlux HD-668B
 
Pretty crystal clear, but recessed/thin mids and fairly V-shaped. Don't like it's signature, but it doesn't mean it's bad. Most  headphones at this price range are garbage.
 
BTW my favorite headphone under $75 is the Beyerdynamic DT-235. Forget to list that here. Maxell DHP-II is good too, but hard to find.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I have a Sennheiser HD580 and it's cable's starting to go. Would you have any advice on a decent cable replacement? I know I can just buy a stock cable from Senn' but why not try something else eh? :) I haven't used anything but stock cables so far.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I'd suggest buying some Cardas Sennheiser plugs and using Belden 1192A ($1.25/foot) or a maybe even the 1172A. 1192A seems a bit similar to the Double Helix wire. DH wire is suggested, but it's kind of expensive. With the 1192A you don't even need sleeving, just some heat shrink at the Y-split. I don't suggest Mogami or Canare with the Sennheiser HD-600/650.
 
Making an HD-600 cable is actually easier than it sounds. I was scared I'd screw something up when I made mine. Just be sure to use flux for the Cardas plugs.
 
I'm waiting for my Cat6 cable from Monoprice to try making one with that. Should be fun..or a waste of some good plugs.

Cheers! Thanks for the intel. :) Gonna try and source some Belden cable here. Seems like it's rather hard to come by in my country.

Recently got the K271's back. After listening to the CD900ST's for so long, the K271's sound a little lackluster. They certainly aren't bad, but the CD900ST's have a similar sound sig, but do everything better.
 
I place the K271's behind the DT770's only because DT770's offer some things (like bass) that the K271's and CD900ST's don't. If it weren't for the Sony's, they'd probably be number one. Or whatever, not sure how my logic is working right now...

Can we get an explanation on the fake ATs? It surprises me that the fakes outrank a couple of pairs of real ATs.  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Unfortunately I'm jumping straight to the HD800's. I was going to get the magnums because Rhydon lives somewhat near me, but I can't really live with the comfort of a grado anymore.

 
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

 

 
Well, the fake pair turned out to sound fantastic for a portable pair. I'd say it sounds like a B&W P5 with more upper mid and more bass impact. It also has better instrument separation, and a warmer, smoother sound signature compared to the M50.
 
I still enjoy the M50, but... whatever the M50 does, obviously my two Beyers do a lot better, and the fake pair is there for a different kind of purpose altogether. I use it to listen to vocals where I can't grab the DT880, and sometimes, I listen to it even if I could grab the DT880.

2. Grado SR-80
3. Audio-Technica ATH-M50
 
Those are the three I use most.  It's tough to pick between the Grado and the Ultrasone, but I probably give the Ultrasone the nod largely because I wear them more.  It's not quiet enough for me to wear the Grados too often.  I use the ATH-M50s quite a bit as well, for some music I like them better but overall I prefer the sound of the Ultrasones.  The M50 wins for comfort though, I find it more comfortable than any others I've worn.
 
I also own the Sennhesier HD-280, but I never use them so I didn't bother to rank them.  Not enough bass for me.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Updated list (now using e17/e9 in place of e7/e9 for DAC/amp):
Ultrasone Pro 2900 (Had these around a month now, I don't regret a single cent spent on them, still deliver eargasms on a regular basis)
Ultrasone HFI 2400
V-MODA M80 (no longer have, returned for comfort issues but I loved the sound)
Ultrasone DJ1
Sennheiser HD-555 (arguably better than the DJ1 but they just don't have enough bass for my preferences where the DJ1's do)
 
 
Hoping to get the V-MODA M100's when they come out, provided I can set enough aside.  (Would love to get the Ultrasone Pro 900 and Beyerdynamic DT770 PRO 80ohm too but unless I get a raise that won't be anytime soon)

3. Soundmagic PL18
4. Phillips SHL9500
 
Since I'm more on the go nowadays, I've been grabbing for my cheapy Coby CV185s the most.  When I'm at home, I reach for my HARX700s for some nice quiet personal listening.  The PL18s are fun and dynamic, but with the buildup of earwax, I rarely use these now unless I'm not lugging any bags with me and can only stuff the PL18s and my phone in my pockets.  I've all but abandoned my SHL9500s, even though they (I feel) are clearer than the Coby's because their small cups and failing cable strain reliefs are more of a problem now then before.  To make things worse, with my large ears, they are very uncomfortable to wear for hours on end for longer commutes.
 
I did not add the Monoprice 8323s since I just ordered them and they have yet to arrive.  Probably will knock my JVCs to the 3rd place because of their folding design (which means I can be on the go with them).

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In my ranking, I looked at sound, design, price and material. In my opinion, the skulcandy isn't nice looking, not so durable as the TMA-1, quite expensive, but has a better sound than the studio's, but not as the TMA-1 or the Denon. But when I looked only to the sound, then it would be, 1 Denon, 2 AIAIAI, 3 Skulcandy, 4 Monster beats, so your right about the sound.

1) DJ100/Tony Bennett (gets nearly everything right to my ears. Love it's addicting mids. Even it's bass is perfect to me)
2) AKG Q701 (like my DJ100, it's sound varies a lot with different sources)
3) AKG K601 (the missing piece for this under-appreciated gem is a good computer DAC ((HRT MSII)). Can't believe the difference that made)
4) HD-580/HD-598 (give me another few months to decide. Prefer the 580 to HD-600. Signature slightly different/better than HD-600)
5) KRK KNS-8400
6) AKG K240 Sextett (it's mids are addicting and I finally got this to sound amazing. Maybe it'll rank higher in a year)
 
All my other stuff is collecting dust.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

All mine are Budget or Entry Level headphones.  I may never jump into the higher range, and am not sure there is a need considering my sources.
 
1.  Grado SR60i  Without customization, these are overly bright and fatiguing, but with my pad modifications and sock mod, they really shine.  The mods darken the sound slightly and take the edge off the highs without adversely affecting the clarity.  This took some experimentation, but was worth the work.  My favorite headphones for most rock, unless I just need some thumping bass.  Which brings us to...
 
2.  Creative Aurvana Live!  If I had to make do with only one headphone, these are the ones I'd choose out of my current selection.  They have more bass when I need it than the Grado, good soundstage for a closed can, so they do well for gaming and movies, and they are slightly more comfortable than the Grado's, even considering the improved comfort of my sock mod.  Bass is a bit loose, but otherwise excellent quality sound.
 
3.  AKG K240 MK II  These are less colored than the others, with a more laid back presentation.  It always takes me a while to get used to their sound again after not using them, but good mids, decent soundstage and excellent comfort levels with the velour pads makes them a good choice for relaxed listening and for watching movies.  The least "fun" and exciting of my current headphones.
 
4.  Koss Porta Pro  Lightweight, extremely comfortable (for me anyway), and acceptable quality sound, though they drop off on the high end and the bass can be a bit muddy.  They are a clear step down from the first three.
 
5.  Sony PQ2  Funky looking headphones that are obviously aimed at the younger crowd, these have some serious limitations on sound.  There is no bass impact from these at all, and the highs fall off quickly, so you are left with the midrange primarily.  Fortunately, the mids are clean and clear.  Light and comfortable for on-ear headphones, I rarely listen to them and they are on semi-permanent loan to my sister.

I'm just going to add the ones I've listened to extensively but do not own as well.
 
1) Stax Lambda normal bias - Sounds great. The only issue is the excessively metallic highs. I'm not sure if I can fix this by changing the source because I haven't tried. If anyone has any ideas I'd like to hear them. I use this with a Fiio A1/SRD-6SB, not exactly high end. Anyway, the mids and bass are excellent. I don't think dynamic headphones are technically capable of rivaling the Stax. Open dynamics always seem to lack sub bass. Closed dynamics are... closed.
 
2) Audio-technica M50 - Pretty balanced sound. Sounds a bit too thick and the highs are a little fatiguing.
 
3) Sennheiser HD280 - I put these here but if I didn't use an equalizer, I wouldn't like these very much. They're capable of good sub bass but they have an annoying dip in the midbass. Also the clarity or crispness is lacking a bit.
 
4) Audio-technica AD700 - I use these a lot since they're comfortable and not fatiguing (to me). Main problem is the lack of bass. Something else seems missing as well. There's that large sound stage though.
 
5) AKG K240S - Also fatigue free. There's a mid bass hump and lack of sub bass though. Not as comfortable as the AD700. An emphasis in the mids.
 
6) Meelectronics A151 - Seems to have poor extension. For portable use they're good enough though.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

UPDATED: After achieving a proper seal I've been extremely satisfied with the K550.
 
There's been more, but the following are the headphones that I feel I've had in-house for long enough and spent enough head time with to draw a conclusive assessment of their overall performance:
 
 
1.   Sennheiser HD600 w/Cardas cable -- There's simply nothing "wrong" that they do to my ears.
2.   Ultrasone Edition 8 -- Stunning from top to bottom with the right chain of components and after accruing some hours on the drivers.  Middling without the prerequisites met.
 


3.   Stock Sennheiser HD600 -- Still great with the stock cable and even a touch more airy than the Cardas, but tonal weight across the board is noticeably lacking in comparison.


 
4.   AKG K550 -- Addictive clarity combined with a great sense of space for a closed headphone.  A bit thin sounding unamped, but when paired with complimentary components that sufficiently stimulate the drivers they're analytically-inclined goodness.  Absolutely requires a good seal to perform to their potential.
 
5.   Grado HF-2 -- Beautifully done bass perfomance.  Not the most "accurate" sound, but thoroughly engaging and enjoyable.
 
6.   Terminator V4 -- A variation on the Darth concept, the midrange is moved forward (still a touch recessed, however) and the bass is reduced a few decibels.  It's still incredibly fun, however, and is the closest I've heard to a headphone sounding like a room of loudspeakers.
 
7.   Darth Beyer V3 -- Possibly the most "fun" headphone on this list, it's the undisputed king of bass.  Beautiful tonal enhancement with some records and a horrible match with others.
 
8.   Ultrasone HFI-580 -- Vastly underrated and often mis-labeled as a purely "basshead can" in my opinion, it has a very clean, detail-oriented sound that's a touch bright of neutral.  Prone to over-amplification but opens up nicely with the right amount.
 
9.   AIAIAI TMA-1 -- A functional fashion statement, they're definitely tuned for DJs with their forward mids and treble.  Add some EQ to the high frequencies and they come to life nicely.  A smooth sound from top to bottom that's still nicely detailed.
 
10.  Koss KSC75 -- Possibly the best "bang for the buck" on this list, they can be found for around $15!  Lacking in extension on both ends, but overall a nice tonal balance and acceptable clarity.  I've always liked clip-on headphones for the gym and these are by far the best I've owned. (although, I refuse to invest in something that'll definitely be getting banged around)  A perfect headphone for those of us who want good portable sound but see portable hi-fi as having a poor return on investment.
 
11.  AKG K271s -- The can that brought me to Head-Fi, they do well on the details and never sound like they "enhance" a particular frequency.  Bass presence is lacking and they can sound sterile, however.
 
12.  Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 -- These could possibly be a few spots higher on my list, but I'm simply not a fan of IEMs due to comfort/fit.  Nice clarity overall but soundstaging was the smallest on this list and treble was too emphasized to my ears.
 
13.  Audio Technica ATH-M50 -- A bit of excitement in the bass, (NOT basshead material though, in my opinion) slightly recessed mids, and some grain in the high end.  Otherwise a great value.
 
14.  Grado RS-1 -- No disrespect to these much-lauded headphones, but they certainly weren't for me.  A small, congested sound with biting highs.  I went in optimistically expecting a more refined HF-2, but I just couldn't find much of anything to like beyond the aesthetics in all honesty.
 
15.  ALO-Modded Ultrasone HFI-780 (ALO-780J) -- Waaaaaay too forward and metallic treble for my liking, reaching a sufficient listening level was a chore.  I've never heard these stock, but if they're half as aggressive as these they'd likely end up in the same position.
 
16.  Ultrasone PRO-900 -- More comfortable than the HFI series offerings, but with serrated treble akin to the ALO-780J and some of the most problematic bass I've heard on a headphone.  Simplistic, non-trebly electronic music sounds fine, but deviating from that niche caused these to transform into an amalgamation of highly unnatural/painful treble, uncontrolled bass, thin mids and excess grain.

Following the final clean-out and so on:
1. Koss ESP/950
2. Sony MDR-F1
The ESP/950s are just intoxicatingly good, and the F1s are the most ethereal/weightless dynamic cans I've ever heard - both are a really smooth and enjoyable listen. The 950s being the better choice. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

2. Brainwavz M2
3. Soundmagic E30
4. Klipsch Image S4
5. Skullcandy Ink'd
6. Sony V-150
7. Sennheiser HD201
Numbers 1 to 4 get regularly rotated on my Sansa Fuze and Clip at home, the V150 and HD201 alternate on my PC, and the Skullcandy Ink'd, although the cheapest, is what I use for my daily one-hour exercise walks because of its poor isolation which allows me to be aware of my surroundings and approaching vehicles. Obvious from my under-$60 (each) equipment that I am just starting out appreciating music via headphones and I hope you will forgive me for going off-thread by asking upgrade advice. I listen mostly to choral groups, choirs, Celtic Woman, Enya and groups like the Brothers Four, Peter Paul & Mary, and the Carpenters. Which would you recommend from among the Brainwavz HM5 and Soundmagic HP100 (both new designs and described as neutral) and the popular, well-rated ATH-M50 which is a relatively old design and may be upgraded soon. I've read a lot of reviews on the HM5 and M50 (there are only 2 reviews on the HP100), and if you have better recommendations, my budget is around $120. Thanks loads.

So, the Ultrasone did not survive the purging (the headband broke - how surprising). So the ESP/950 and MDR-F1 were left. After a while of not having anything that isolates or has serious bass impact, I decided to do something about that. And I've discovered a closed headphone that actually works like it should. Light-weight, isolates, good extension and impact without being insane, and a non-screwed up midrange/topend that isn't sibilant or harsh in the least. In other words, doing it's job.
New ranking as follows:
1. Koss ESP/950 (what, you thought something had *that* much of a chance?)
2. Bose QC15
3. Sony MDR-F1
Barring any major catastrophes, I think that's pretty stable. Flame away.
igor:
Have you tried the Sennheiser HD 280 out? Or the CAL!? (That's "CAL!" not "!?"). 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have more time with my DT 880 600ohm so I will currently place them above my new HD 650s which I can tell are very special. Once I finally get my Auditor here I will really be able to listen to these headphones, but for now anyway:
 
1) DT 880
2) HD 650
3) DT 770 Pro (80ohm)
4) Koss PortaPro (still really good value for the money I think)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Been putting some serious time on the AKG K271's, so I think I'll move them up a rank. The ranking now being:
 
1. CD900ST's
2. K271's
3. DT770 Pro 80
 
The more forward mid range on the K271's make them good for low level listening and noisy environments. I recently flew (for the first time!) and brought the K271's, and they worked very well. To be honest, I expected planes to be louder. I think pretty much every car I've ever rode in was louder (or at least had more low-frequency noise). The isolation on the K271's was really nice for this, and really, I think the isolation on the CD900ST's would have be sufficient for the plane ride.

Haha. Sorry, I'm not laughing *at* you, it's just kind of a funny observation. I'd agree that aircraft generally aren't that bad - at least modern commercial jet airliners. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Obobskivich, the Sennheiser 280 was among my first choices when I started researching on headphones but I gathered from extensive reading that, except for the portables, most Sennheiser hps would benefit from amping -- and I am avoiding that route due to budget considerations. The CAL! it seems would be a better choice and I have asked a friend to get it for me (or the KRK KNS6400, depending on availability). Would you choose the CAL! over the ATH-M50? thanks.

I know it's strange, but I think the K550s sound better than my D5000s. And while the Philips seems out of place, I got them for like $15 and I think for that price it makes a decent portable. I'm really paranoid about my headphones getting scratched and it's a huge relief to just pop them on and not give a crap about bashing them against the wall and so on.

Yes. Sound the same to me. Honestly i've never done an A/B comparison, but I know the DJ100's signature very well.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Koss Pro DJ 100 / TB
 
I listen to this the most out of all my headphones. Weird. When I have a quick listen before bed i'll usually end up listening to it until 3am! This and the SR-225i have the most addicting mids i've heard.
 
2. AKG Q701
 
Sounds terrible with all my garbage tracks. Some Cantopop is unbearably bad on it. Love almost everything about it except for that issue. Owned it since October 2011 and it's a keeper this time around (K702 wasn't).
 
3. Sennheiser HD-580
 
I've been listening to this a lot more than the HD-598 lately. Is it better? Not really, but i'll rank it here now. The HD-600 puts me to sleep, but this is really fun to listen to. Not a ton of mid-bass and more treble than the HD-600 to my ears. Sounds clearer too. It's still a bit too warm and not as clear as it could be. Paid only $150 for it and quite the deal. Perfect for gaming.
 
4. Sennheiser HD-598
 
Haven't used this much lately, but I love it a lot. To me, it's quite smooth and nice for when I want to not be bothered by any of my very harsh and fatiguing tracks. Takes the slight edge off them kind of. I haven't felt like doing A/B comparisons with the 580. I'll enjoy both for what they are. The 598 has a much better soundstage though for sure and more forward mids. Less forward upper mids though I think. HD-580 has a little more bass and is slightly fuller sounding, but it's kind of annoying at times.
 
5. AKG K601
 
Love this headphone for gaming. This one gets nearly everything right for me. Seems to have boosted lower treble, which can be a bit of a problem.
 
6. KRK KNS-8400
 
This has dropped down on my list. Not sure why, but maybe just that I don't listen to it much. If I'm not listening to my DJ100 I rarely listen to my closed headphones. I think this one is a hidden gem for gaming. Feels like a poor man's Q701 that's closed and with more treble. Love Skyrim? You must try it with this. Just trust me on that. Competitive gamers who need a closed headphone should try this out.
 
7. AKG K240 Sextett
 
My pair sounds pretty good (finally). Instruments sound very realistic. The mids on my pair sound neutral, but there seems to be slightly forward upper mids and not enough low bass extension and not enough treble. Imaging and soundstage accuracy is impressive. Mine is recabled with Mogami W2893. I don't know..the sound signature seems a bit goofy. The mids are very full sounding and not even remotely thin.

1. Sony MDR-CD900ST's.
Still the reigning king of the mid range. Don't think anything is going to be topping them anytime soon.
 
2. Sony MDR-7509
Just got these yesterday, and have really been enjoying my time with them. Pretty warm sounding overall, though some of the treble frequencies are a little boosted, and the upward extension is good. Soundstage is really huge for a closed headphone, makes them really awesome for movies and games. At first the mids on these sounded a little recessed, but they're just lacking that upper mid-range bump. They're more focused on the lower mid range, which suits female vocals very well.
 
3. Sony MDR-ZX700
A little bright in the upper-mids and highs. Kind of remind me a little bit of a Grado. I find myself needing to turn the volume down to prevent myself from getting fatigued, but once I do that, I find plenty to like about these. The soundstage in particular has me impressed. The forward projection of the sound has more depth than the other two headphones I own. I would have figured these would be better for small acoustic arrangements, but I find myself preferring just regular ol' mid-size band arrangements. More than anything though, these have me very interested in the Z1000's.
 
Oh, one thing that really, really bugs me about the ZX700's is I can't use them with my Little Dot I+. They are very, very, very noisy out of it. I have no idea why it's so noisy, and it bugs the hell out of me.

Wow, some of you guys have such crazy setups. I only have a pair of Grado SR225's that are currently being modded atm with new cables/drivers...I sent them to Chris_Himself directly after ordering from Amazon so I haven't even been able to listen to it yet. Super excited as I have never listened to a real pair of headphones. The only pair of headphones I have listened to were Beats, =/

I’ve updated my headphone inventory.
 
currently:
 
1. LCD-3 - I was not a fan of the LCD-2 but the LCD-3 (RMA model) are more comfortable, have better sound staging and imaging and a more lively midrange and treble. The bass is still amazingly accurate and deep. They’re slightly forgiving of weak recordings while still being capable of show stopping performance with well recorded, complex songs.
 
2. Magnum v4 with flat pads - They take everything I love about the RS1 but make the highs less sibilant and the midrange less shouty. A very fun headphone that, imo, benefits greatly from the flat pads that add some sweetness to the mids, oomph to the bass, and further reduces treble harshness.
 
3. Grado SR60i - They have their issues with treble and aren’t technically up there with the high end Grados but they can be plugged into any iPod and sound good. i can toss them into a backpack and not worry about them.
 
4. hisoundaudio PAA-1 Pro. Wonderful little earbuds. I can’t get used to IEMs so these little buds are my portable earphones. When I’m at work or outside and need to hear a little external noise, I’m not too worried about amazing detail retrieval or technicalities. What I want is just an appealing tonality and thats what the PAA-1 Pro deliver. The bass is nice and punchy and mids are warm and a little up front. For around 40 bucks, I think these are a no brainer.
 
 
If we include the headphones I’ve had the past few months (and have since sold or am in the process of selling):
 
1. LCD-3
2. Grado HP-1 (It was hard to sell these but I knew they would get minimal head time with the LCD3 around and I can’t afford to keep almost 2 grand worth of headphones sitting on a rack)
3. Sennheiser HD800 
4. Magnum v4
5. Grado PS1000
6. Grado PS500
7. Grado GS1000
8. Alessandro MS2
9. Grado SR60i

1. AKG Q701. Perfection... Well, it is for me anyway. I listen to a lot of dubstep, but what surprised me at first was the bass. Sure, some might say it is lacking that heavy hitting bass, but oh my goodness, that's not what a nice pair of headphones is truly about. They produce an accurate, very detailed bass. So, there is quality, not quantity. Exactly how it should be. To me, these headphones are just "Game Over" in just about every way possible. I enjoy listening to music with these on every day. Or, at least the days when I have time. Highly recommend these.
 
2. Modded Monoprice 8323. It seems very weird having a pair of 25 dollar headphones ranked right next to the 10x priced AKG Q's, but bear with me here. These are no ordinary 25 dollar headphones. These, in my opinion, are the best 25 dollar headphones on the market today. If you do not have a pair, get one. Simple as that, and here is why. In their stock state, they have quite a bit of bass, but that can be fixed by ordering some nice Beyerdynamic Velour Pads. So, more comfort and more sound quality. (It's kind of funny, the pads cost as much as the headphones themselves.) There is also headband padding you can buy on amazon, and it does wonders. They are now about as comfortable as my Q's. So, pretty comfy. Not only that, compare the sound to just about any 100-200 dollar set, and be amazed.
 
3. Numark Red Wave. Portability, price, sound, comfort, looks and bass all packaged into a set of headphones. That's what these headphones are all about. If you like bassy music, these are a great start for an upgrade from your iThingys you got with your portable iSomething. Also, a nice step up from the XB500's, in my opinion. Yeah, the Red Waves don't have as much bass, but they make up for it in more sound quality. I often tell people to start here on their headphone journey, as well as the 8323's.
 
4. Sony XB500. Bass, bass and more bass. What more do you want to know? These headphones are like Beats on steroids, except for a fraction of the cost. Why pay 300 bucks for sound that you can get in the 50 buck XB500's? It makes near no sense to me. But, whatever, to each his own, I suppose. And, that's about all I have to say, other than I can't believe I just made a Beats reference in a Head-Fi post...
 
5. Sony V700DJ. This was my first pair of headphones that I purchased because I just wanted something... different. You know, almost everyone around me had the Skullcandy's and the iThingys, I was a "Rebel." The V700's are quite nostalgic, I guess you could say. They look like 1990's all the way. Just my style (90's kid.) They just come with a certain nostalgia... Anyway, Not the greatest sounding pair of headphones, especially around 125 bucks. Yes, I know, that's outrageous. But, anyway, They sure do grab attention, as if they were plated in gold. But, hey, I like them. 
 
I'm really enjoying reading these posts and all of the stories that go with them. Let's keep them coming for a long, long time.

Sennheiser HD800(with Black Dragon cable)-Accuracy defined.  Soundstage as wide as the Grand Canyon.  The ones I reach for first every time.  The veil is gone forever with these cans. No other phones can put me into a state of aural nirvana as these can.
 
Audeze LCD-2.2.  Great for creating an intimate, small club setting.  Small, tight soundstage with a slightly enhanced low end compared to the HD800's. Vocals are clear, crisp, and so close you would swear the vocalist is actually inside your head.  I have a weakness for the airy openness of planer technology as I have been using Magnepan Speakers for my 2 channel stereo and home theater for many years.
 
JH Audio JH-16 Pro IEM's.  I use these exclusively when on the go with my FLAC files through my Cowan portable players.  They sound great equalized from the Cowans.  Eight drivers per ear with 4 of them dedicated to low end reproduction-simply astounding bass response and extension while maintaining crystal clear mids and vocals.  Absolutely no harshness in the upper registers.  Jerry Harvey is simply an amazing sound engineer and IEM designer.

SR-225s are fine headphones - they hit well above their weigh class.

Great point about the bass. I feel the same way and I always enjoy seeing others who appreciate this distinction. Very cool that you've also found headphones that are perfect for you. It's a great feeling to know you have phones that you just connect with in every way.

1- Sennheiser HD598 - The first time I've ever spent over $100 on a pair of headphones. Besides some strange design issues, (3.5mm adapter?) I love them. Compared to the my other headphones they have such a warm sound. And the style? I feel like a classy gentleman with them on and I think I should start smoking cigars and drinking scotch while wearing them.
2- Shure srh440- Clear, detailed sound with no colouring. These served me well for over 2 years. Incredibly durable! I mean they're built like a hummer. Lacking in bass impact though, which can make some music less fun.
3- Grado sr80i- Broke before I really got a chance to use them, no warranty. I haven't worked up courage to take them apart yet. I'm sure I would've liked them though.
 
4- Koss porta pro- Before I knew anything about head-fi I bought these for SQ and the style (I liked them it at least). Overwhelming but fun bass. I really forgot how fun these were until I tried them on a while back. Really flimsy cables, have had to replace jack twice and have given up.

Sennheiser HD 25-1 II by Adidas
My first $100+ closed cans. Wow. The first time I plugged these babies into my E9 I had a multiple eargasm. The sound is flawless. Balanced, clear, with tight punchy bass, crystal clear mids, and sibilant-free highs. Great soundstaging for a closed can. The PRaT factor is strong in this one--sound is very exciting. From classical and vocal to mod jazz and funk to hip-hop and house these babies deliver with clear imaging and accurate sound. They are comfortable and isolate superbly. Ruggedly portable enough to carry in a knapsack. I think one would be hard pressed to find any significant issue with HD 25. If I had to live with one headphone for the rest of my life--this would be it.
 
Phonak Audeo Perfect Bass PFE 022
A bit anemic on the bass response even with the green filters, but a very warm and engaging sound with absolutely stunning mids. Vocal is where these really shine. Listen to some Adele or Sharon Jones and the nuanced sound brings out such details you can practically hear their hearts breaking. Not bad with electronic or rock but the lack of bass takes much of the fun out it. Classical suffers from a relatively small soundstage and they are hungry little canalphones--a good amp or some compression is needed to get sufficient volumes out of the quiet parts. Fit is comfortable, one of the the most comfortable IEMs I've used. Microphonics are low, durability is good. Not for everyone, but a quality product.
 
Samson SR850
This is how entry-level cans are done right. Big 50mm drivers, great quantities of bass, huge soundstaging, classic AKG-type styling. The sound is remarkably clear and accurate. Fast moving sound can sometimes be a bit of a challenge and the bass doesn't extend down quite as far as I would like but they're still the best can I've heard for <$50 new.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Now that I have had some ear time with the MD's... No A/B'ing so far though, so just very general impressions.
 
1. MrSpeakers Mad Dogs - clearly faster than D5000's and either more linear sub bass extension or less forward mids makes the sound have a more solid base, so to say. Which I found surprising because D5000's are so bassy; would think that bass provides base but for me not. The bass quality and texture is also superior. Actually, the SQ and texture is superior throughout the spectrum. More linear FR. The MD's make good recordings sound very life-like, something I did not achieve with the D5000's.
 
2. Denon AH-D5000 - loved these until I got the MD's. Still a great pair of cans but MD's seem to do everything a bit (or a lot) better. Acoustic, intimate recordings sound quite nice with these, together with electronic and hip hop music due to prominent bass and worse detail (if the recording is not very good) than MD's.
 
3. Audio-Technica ATH-M50 - my first venture into higher quality headphones. Not necessarily bad headphones, but there is no soundstage, detail retrieval is fairly bad compared to my other ones and the mids are too recessed.
 
4. SteelSeries Siberia V2 - for gaming.

I am revisiting this thread because most of my "good" headphones are either in storage or being sold. In addition, my primary music listening is now from an iPhone 3GS. I do not use my PCDPs any more, and only listen to my home system through loudspeakers (and only occasionally, at that).
 
Of those headphones that I put through the iPhone lately, my ranking is as follows (in terms of my personal enjoyment, not in terms of absolute sound quality):
 
1) Skullcandy Aviator (bought this only because I needed a headphone with iPhone controls and a mic, but surprisingly good sound for a celebrity-endorsed headphone that doesn't cost as much as you-know-whom's Beats)
(tie) Sennheiser PX 100-II
3) Sony MDR-7506 (a bit thin in the upper bass/lower mids and a bit harsh up top)
4) Sennheiser HD 280 Pro (rather dull and boring)
5) Sony MDR-7509 (overly warm sounding)

1. Superlux HD681 (RIP)  First pair of 'good' headphones. Good build quality, More comfortable then the pannies (I had bent the metal headband and installed custom pads). Bass was good enough. Detail and clarity blew me away.
2. Panasonic RP-HTF600-S - Nice smooth sound, easy on my ears, relatively comfortable without pads/bending, Sound is warm thick and rich vs the Superlux

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

HD 800's: Couldn't be happier with these headphones, in a different league from what I've owned or own presently
 
HE 500's: Most accurate headphones I've ever heard to my ears; very natural. Nice bass impact and bloom.
 
LCD 2 rev2 (previously): Fun sounding headphone with nice bass and midrange presence. Very mediocre in the upper mids and highs. Not necessarily my cup of tea; find it overrated personally. Not comfortable.
 
HD600's/ HD650's (previously): Very good considering the price you can get them for online. Very natural sounding again but not as much microdetail as the hifiman. Slight preference to the 600's.
 
IE8's: Very fun and dynamic headphone. Unnatural amounts of bass, but it's fun when on the go/ daily commute.
 
Fostex T50RP Paradox: Most neutral sounding headphone I've ever heard. Best closed can I own... Comfortable. Easy to EQ. Lacks detail retrieval due to driver limitations.
 
Grado Alessandro MS2i: Meant to be magnumized but got HE500's instead. Very dynamic headphone, amazing bass. Use it to practice bass guitar.
 
Hifiman RE0's: For 70 bucks these are fantastic. Kind of lean in the bass department, but good when eq'd.
 
Shure SRH 440: What probably started the addiction. Very good price/performance ratio. Detailed and clear (sterile) mids. Lacking bass.
 
Shure SE215: Amazing comfort and isolation. Good build. Sound quality is good for the price; fun sounding signature.
 
And also, something I've owned but could not use at the time I owned it:
 
AKG K1000's: Got them by luck for a ludicrous price and sold them. Did not have anyway to use the xlr plugs during the week I owned it. Too bad.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Still starting out so nothing really flashy or super high end.
 
1. Superlux HD668B - these are really nice, and my primary listening headphones. I dig the semi-openness, and the more or less neutral sound is pleasing to my ears. Listening to some of my favorite jazz charts with this, I heard things I've never heard before, and my mouth dropped.
2. Sennheiser HD 429 - also good, but not as neutral as the above cans. Bassier though, so I use it for hip hop, jazz sometimes, or my bassy music. First good headphones I've gotten. Very clean sound, enjoyable for most anything. My only qualm is after using the above cans, I now prefer semi-open versus the closed back of these.
3. Sony MDR-ZX100 - needed something to tie me over before I bought the above two headphones, $15 on clearance at TJ Maxx. Light and portable, prominent bass, fun to listen to when you just want to listen and not be analytical. Can get muddy at times though.
4. Skullcandy ink'd earphones - yeah, I got these two years ago, they're pretty bad now that I've been exposed to nice headphones. Airy, tinny sound character, thin. I use them for when I can't bring my Sony's (my portable cans), and when I drum along to music.
 
Honorable mention - AKG K240 Monitors - these technically aren't mine but I used them a ton before I got my own headphones. Loved them. Very comfy, and the sound was great. Couldn't put them down.

Second ranking, I'd say in term of satisfaction for the buck, frequency of use,  convenience of use (portability, isolation, etc).

1- srh940 (cracks ....)
2- hd800 (let's hope, they 'll remain intact)
3- hd595 (cracks, teared up ear pads)
4- yamaha eph-100
5- k317 (died, but that's my fault)
6- senn ie7 (occasional problems after at least 3 year of use).
7- hd25 II
8- pmx680
9- ksc75
 
Both ranking are subject to change , nothing definitive, just sharing my current impressions.

After some more listening and time, I think two rankings is probably more fair:
Fun-ness:
- Grado RS-1i
- Koss ESP/950
- Audio-Technica ATH-ESW9
- Sony MDR-F1
Right-ness:
- Koss ESP/950
- Sony MDR-F1
- Audio-Technica ATH-ESW9
- Grado RS-1i
Both are very tight groups. All four are absolutely great imho. 
In terms of my mobile sets:
- Denon AH-C751
- Koss R/80
- Sony MDR-EX082
The Koss would score at the top if isolation weren't a consideration.

Sometimes the 580 just sounds more accurate. Mine doesn't sound like the HD-600, but close.
I do miss the soundstage of the 598 and it's mids. 598 is also a bit more fun to listen to though.

T'he Beats Pro and Detox in my avatar are knockoffs. I use the IE8is, Pros and the Detox for the gym (I also get a great neck workout with them). The MTPGs and the 8320 are what I listen to the most. If I'm listening to a song with vocals I'll plug in my MDs, but I dont listen to them very much. The Diddy Beats were my first set of mid priced IEMs and they are what got me into Head-fi. The M9p, Beta and JVCs I got yesterday and am in the process of burning them in. My two faviorites are the Monoprice because of the sound to price ratio(love how they sound) and the Turbines.

Revised list.
 
1) Audio Technica ES10 - amped or unamped, these cans are still clearly better than the ones mentioned below. Bass hits harder than HD 650.
2) Sennheiser HD 650 - sold after a short while of owning. Sounds a bit too dark for some of my tracks. But nice bass impact. Main reason for selling: I don't like the way they look on my head.
3) Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250 Ohm - sold when I decided I liked the tone of the DT880 more, but I missed the bass impact of these cans.
3) Beyerdynamic DT880 600 Ohm - sold now as well. Used to be my general-purpose cans. ES10 dethroned them easily.
4) Audio Technica ATH-ESW9 - these sound like portable HD 650... but smoother and don't require an amp. Plus they look awesome!
5) Audio Technica ATH-ES7 - I think these come very close to being like a portable closed-back version of the DT880. Except that their midrange is a lot more forward.
6) Audio Technica ATH-M50S LE - my entry to low-end, and now I'm climbing up the ladder
7) ...random headphones that I should try to consolidate at some point as the stack is growing.

Alessandro MS-Pro YAY!
Earsonics SM3 (Might purchase again later on <3)
Ultimate Ears Triple.fi 10 (Seriously miss these, but they had a terrible fit :( Plus they stuck out soooo much)
Sennheiser IE80 (Good times...)
Denon D2000 (Decent)

VSonic GR02 (decent)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) HD-800
 
Soundstage and detail retrieval can't be beat. Most comfortable headphone I've ever used. The sound signature is a bit bright with less bass impact than I would like, but I've found them to be very responsive to EQ. Those who dislike the default balance of these cans really owe it to themselves to listen again the help of some EQ, anaxilus mods, or careful component matching because when you get the tonal balance right you're left with a technological marvel. The biggest downside is the sheer amount of poorly recorded music that is borderline unlistenable under the HD-800's microscopic gaze.
 
2.) LCD-3
 
I don't think many will argue that the LCD-3's have the best bass performance you can get in heaphones. You could describe the LCD-3's as smooth yet visceral. Slightly uncomfortable for me, but they are getting easier to wear as I adapt to them. They're more forgiving than the HD-800's, and easily the best cans for electronic music or the 'harsher' genres. I think the LCD-3s fall behind the HD-800s when it comes to the very best recordings though. When I switch from the LCD-3 to the HD-800, I find myself missing the low end performance and impact, but the increased detail and soundstage is more engrossing to me and I miss that more when I go back to the LCD-3. I enjoy the LCD-3 a lot more when I'm not comparing it against the HD-800. The reverse is also true to but to a far lesser extent. If only I could have it all!
 
3.) AH-D7000
 
The D7000 can make even the worst recordings sound good, very, very "fun." Technically soundstage isn't as good as most fully open cans, but is interesting to listen to thanks to the semi-open design. The HD-800 outshines everything else completely in this regard, but the D7000 is actually my second favorite in soundstage -- and that's just down to the fact that it's so much different than anything else. The fact that they kind of isolate is an added bonus. Despite all of this, the Denon's can't possibly hope to beat the above two cans working with good quality material, and that puts it squarely in third place. The worst thing about the D7000 is the fear you get whenever you pick them that they will fall apart in your hands (had someone else's D2000 fall apart on me during a meet, not a pleasant sensation)
 
4.) K-702
 
Basically a subset of the HD-800. Good, but everything the K-702 does the HD-800 does better. Despite that, this is probably the best headphone in the world for competitive gaming thanks to it's imaging. Imagine a straight line through your head from ear to ear, extended just as far as the HD-800, but with very little in the front. Makes for an unnatural musical presentation, and despite it's width I'd actually rank the K-702's as second last for soundstage. For gaming it just works, and that's what I use the K-702 for.
 
-tied with-
5.) HD-650
 
Easy to listen to, non-fatiguing, and the shape makes it very easy to wear while lying in bed. That being said, if I'm not lying in bed I'm probably going to listen with something else. Soundstage is good, and despite the fact that treble is rolled off there is still sparkle and very little sibilance. The high frequency presentation means you aren't engulfed by detail at every moment but you appreciate it more when you find it, if that makes sense. The real bummer for me is the bass -- a little bit too muddy, a little bit too "one-tone," and that's what keeps me from really falling for these cans.
 
-tied with-
6.) HF-1 (headphile mods, woodied, C-pads)
 
Colored and unnatural for sure (big bumps in mid-bass and mid-treble to my ears), but on some music it just works. Worse than the HD-650 and K-702 in practically every techincal way, but a much better foil against the top three and thus gets more head time. These are my "The Police" headphones. Is it a bad sign when you have headphones for individual bands? 
 
7. HD-272
 
Easily the worst of the bunch. Sometimes you just need isolation though, especially when you're a musician, and these isolate exceptionally well. When I'm jamming on my TD-20, I use these. They aren't bad, but are clearly outclassed by everything else. I wouldn't call them "fart cannons", but things are leaning in that direction. Bass is big and somewhat muddy, highs represented well enough but feel spartan -- there is never any sparkle to them. Mid range is decent, but not creamy or lush, and the bass is intruding and polluting the region. Soundstage is nothing at all to write home about. A dependable workhorse, but nothing I'd use if I wanted to enjoy listening to music.

650 or 880

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I know u didn't ask me, but HD650 all the way.  Dt880 is more of an all rounder, light, airy, neutral but a bit bass anemic w/o J$ pads.  650 meatier, dark side of neutral, better bass.

Superlux HD681 = Panasonic RP-HTF600-S
 
Superlux for when I'm in the mood for some clarity. The Pancake for when I want bass punch. 
 
I find that both are equally good value. I like both signatures very equal. I love almost all my headphones equal. The reason for this is I only have two.

Koss Pro DJ100 (M50 pads)
If I had to pick only one headphone to use, it'd be this. That says a lot. The others aren't much better really, just open.
I've yet to find any closed headphone I like more. Not the SRH-840/940, M50, KRKs or whatever else. KRK KNS-8400 get close, but these have better bass.
I find them more revealing than the Q701. Yeah, I said it. These with my ODAC pick apart anything wrong with my setup. Sounds similar to the HD-580 or modded HD-600, but with more treble.
 
AKG Q701
Even better now that I got my new ODAC for it. Now even more neutral than before.
 
HD-600 (modded only)
I applied a small square of Creatology foam to back of circle vent area. It reduces the bloated bass to neutral levels and makes it sound crystal clear and even more detailed.
IMO this makes that "veil" go bye-bye. Still wish it had a tad more treble. Seems like LESS than neutral treble. Stock HD-600 is much too forgiving.
 
K601
Better comfort and imaging than the Q701. This is one headphone i'll never part with. Very underrated. Perfect gaming headphone.
 
KRK KNS-8400
I used this last night for the first time in weeks an was still impressed. It's mids often seem a tad laid back (not upper mids) compared to the 6400. It makes my DJ100 look like a bass monster.
 
HD-598 (this dropped down a few spots due to lack of use)
The Q701 has me spoiled, so it's hard to go back to this. The modded HD-600 might surpass this. I don't like the HD-600 stock at all and have always preferred the 598. HD-580 is great though (same driver).
 
ATH-AD300
Way better than the AD700. Less treble, fuller mids and some decent bass. More bass than my KNS-8400! Less sub-bass though. Some low bass doesn't even register on this thing. It's a fun headphone. Got it for $35 on sale at..Wal-Mart!! Sounds closer to the AD2000 than the AD700.

1. Grado SR225i - Found for a good price so upgraded from 125's.  Better tonal balance and air.
 
2. Grado SR125i - Got at a discount from a local shop. Loved the bright sound.

4. Ety HF5 - Sterile, almost too much so.  Great for analyzing, not as great for leisurely enjoyment.
 
5. AKG K430 - Decent portable set with no significant flaws, though lacking a tad in detail retrieval.
 
6. JVC FX101 - Fat sub-bass and when EQ'd, surprisingly good clarity.

Since I've already ranked the current headphones I own, I figure I'll rank all the headphones I've ever owned. (Or, rather, the headphones I've owned since I really got into headphones)
 
1. Sony MDR-CD900ST. As mention for the last few of my rankings, they are the absolute king of the mid range.
 
2. AKG K601. Before the CD900ST's these had the best mids of any headphone I owned. I had certainly heard better, but for their price, they just couldn't be beat. I also loved how comfortable they were. I'm sort of missing these now, but I gave them up to move on to better things (eventually).
 
3. AKG K271. Really fantastic bang-for-the-buck. Incredible isolation, wonderful mids, and a very detailed, yet smooth sound. They stayed in my collection longer than any other headphone.
 
4. Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80. Headphones just don't get more comfortable than this. Their isolation is also very good, and their smooth, warm sound was quite a treat.
 
5. Sony MDR-7509. I actually think these sound better than the Beyers, but I put them behind them just because of that unbeatable comfort. These have a pretty huge soundstage for being a closed headphone, and their warm mids is really something different. Not used to mids being so warm, but it's really nice with certain artists.
 
6. Ultrasone Pro 750. I think I would have liked these more if I had them as a secondary 'phone. I had traded my K601's for them, and at the time the added treble and bass energy was really exciting. The more time I put on them, however, I noticed their mids were really, really bad. Like, worse than my XB700's. They did offer some upgrades over them, most notably the incredibly clean and tight bass. There was still plenty of quantity too, but I was just totally blown away by the level of control on the bass. Much better than my DT770 Pro's or my friend's Denon AH-D2000's.
 
7. Koss Pro DJ 100. A well rounded headphone with a nice mid range and a reasonably large soundstage, at least coming off my V6's at the time. In the $50 price range, they were pretty much impossible to beat.
 
8. Sony MDR-V6. I think I generally like these more than the DJ100's, but that's probably due to familiarity bias. I just love the fact that they fold, they isolate pretty well, they sound very good, and are more comfortable than the Koss's.
 
9. Sony MDR-XB700. These are another headphone that are very dear to my heart, and I kind of miss. Their mids were kind of bad, and their bass was kind of loose, but when you got a good amp behind them they really cleaned up. Very large soundstage, incredible comfort, and spiked bass and treble made they very nice for gaming and movies.
 
10. Sony MDR-ZX700. I really like their comfort and isolation, and their soundstage and imaging are pretty neat, but their sound is just so harsh. If I want to listen to music on these I have to turn the volume down because the sibilance is just so bad. I like them for games and movies though...
 
11. AKG K81DJ. This is another case where I think they sound better than the headphone above, but they lose out due to comfort. Their sound is really warm and pleasant, but the headband dug into my head so bad I had to get rid of them. Does anyone know if the K181's have a bigger headband?
 
12. Koss KSC-75. We've all heard how great the KSC-75's are, so I won't go into detail, but headphones in this price range just don't get better.

Some movement:
1. Koss ESP/950 - They're "best" because they do everything very well, and have no glaring flaws; I could listen to these forever - they're comfortable sounding and wearing.
2. Ultrasone PRO2900 | Grado RS-1i - I can't really decide which one of these I like better. Both of them are colored and unique, and I happen to like both flavors very much (despite them being relatively different). It's kind of a back and forth for "best dynamic can" in my world. Like home theater versus 2-channel. I doubt there will ever be a solid consensus as to which one is best to me.
3. Sony MDR-F1 - Basically how I imagine a dynamic can trying to play at electrostatics would work. Very airy, effortless, spacious sounding. Comfortable too.
4. Audio-Technica ATH-ESW9 - I don't like that these are "last" because I think they're spectacular overall, but they aren't quite as effortless/easy-listening as the F1 or ESP, and while their coloration is nice, it isn't my favorite shade. Very good closed cans though, and excellent all-rounders.

they are still working. The frame is cracked so I'm hardly using them anymore. I'm trying to repair them sometime.
Though comparing them there is not much point of using them anymore. The HD 800 just does everything better in my opinion except the
HD 595 is really light-weight

Man Im having a real tough time deciding between my DT770 Premium 250 ohm and my 32 Ohm DT990 Premiums.
If only I could meld them into one 'phone I would be one happy camper... or actually an even happier camper that is cuz I'm loving both. 😍

Each awesome in it own way.

Hmmmn, mine in (rough) order:
 
1. Grado GS1000i
2. Beyerdynamic T5p
3. Audio Technica ATH-W3000ANV (new addition, loving their sound but may slip when shiny new toy status wears off)
4. Grado RS1
5. Ultrasone Ed 8
6. Audeze LCD-2.2
7. Sennheiser HD251-II
 
A fair proportion of my listening is portable though, which is probably why the closed headphones sit a little nearer the top.
 
Will get the Sig Pros next I think and see where they fit in, after that I would imagine I will probably be almost at the point where I will feel solid enough about my preferences amongst these to let a few go. Probably switch gears a bit and start looking at source gear more.

Yay Grado! I liked the PS-500 when I heard it at the last meet. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Probably not though. More likely that the 241 drivers were merely based on Sextett drivers; like the DF drivers that were probably based (and only that) on the K 241/250 drivers, etc.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I use my headphones for recreational listening as well as tracking and mixing at odd hours.
 
1. K 702: Extremely transparent and natural, huge soundstage, the best mixing headphones I've ever tried, enjoyable to wear, no obvious flaws. Made in Austria. Gigantic.
Recreational listening score: 9 Mixing score: 9.
 
2. DT 880: 250 ohms version. A close second. Pretty neutral but too "smooth" for mixing to me, extremely comfortable, made in Germany and build like a tank. Wish it had a detachable cable. No apparent flaws for listening, simply not as revealing as the AKGs despite having tighter treble and deeper bass.
Recreational listening score: 8 Mixing score: 8
 
3. SRH840: #1 in price/performance ratio. Very heavy-duty and versatile with a high-resolution sound. Made in... Probably China. Treble is slightly too "shouty" for long sessions. Great for tracking.
Recreational listening score: 7 Mixing score: 8
 
4. K 240: "Studio" version. Papery bass and inaccurate treble, but the most amazing mid-range at any price. Best looking headphone ever. I would like an Austrian example, but mine are of the newer Chinese stock.
Recreational listening score: 6 (due to being limited to mid-range centric genres) Mixing score: 5
 
I just exchanged my new DT 990s for DT 770s so we will see where those rank (the DT 880s were basically just a superior version of the DT 990s in every way).
 
The rest of the stuff in my signature: I didn't really love any of them so ranking them would be arbitrary.
 
Q-40: Too much bass to be usable for my home studio. Just a "fun" headphone with really cheap ear pads. A good choice for people who like extreme bass levels without scooped mids/harsh treble.
Recreational listening score: 6 Mixing score: 3
 
HFI-580: Excessive (albeit impressive) bass + painful spikes in the upper mid range. Literally made my ears hurt. Very "tinny" sounding. Nice build quality, though.
Recreational listening score: 4 Mixing score: 1
 
SR60: - Grado is to headphones what Harley is to motorcycles. You either get it or you don't. I didn't get it. Robbed all enjoyment from my music, fell off my head and sounded like a shower radio before finally breaking.
Recreational listening score: 3 Mixing score: 1
 
MDR-V500: No bass, harsh treble, tolerable but lo-fi mids, uncomfortable, fell apart from light use.
Recreational listening score: 2 Mixing score: 3
 
XPT100: Another version of the HM5/FA-003 + huge angled ear pads and all-black finish. Neutral, but very smothered/veiled and a somewhat... bBoring. Sounds "lo-fi" sound compared to competitors at the price like the SRH840.
Recreational listening score: 4 Mixing score: 6

People started adding some blurbs as to why they made their choices a few pages back, and it seems like a good idea. I don't know if I'd go as far as "full review" (that'd be HUGE) but with my most recent listy I put some insight as to WHY I made the choices I did. Like machoboy did. Strikes me as more helpful I guess. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Oh I don't mind it, and I appreciate the time and enthusiasm (hence the wink and all).  It's just very amusing to see email notifications day after day that are nothing more than numbered lists.  Then all of a sudden, WHAM!

I think warrenpchi was just joking.  
 
I really enjoy the mini reviews.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Other than the pending arrival of the DT 770s, I think the K 702s have pretty much concluded my headphone search for now, so consider that post my cornerstone Head-Fi contribution.
Since almost everything in that list was purchased within the last month I thought I would summarize the whole ordeal.
 
At least I'm stopping before I get into the Stax/HD800 type stuff. Now I have to spend money on a new computer...
Edited by machoboy - 9/29/12 at 7:06pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Agreed.  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Having both K702 & DT880 phones, I can say that the Stax/HD800 type stuff is at least 2 steps above them.
Yet, I still love my HD650 ad HD600's.
 
My favourite dynamic is still my anax moddded HD800
My favourite electrostatic is the 02 MK1.
The most addictive is the HE60.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
preproman,

how would you compare the Paradox & Mad Dogs? (sound, comfort, earpads, etc.)
which mod do you like better and which is the better value?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
 
The Mad Dogs cost less.  But now LFF offers things like re cabling, custom paint jobs, different ear pads.  So the cost of these will go up but with justification.
 
Sound.
Totally different and it depends on what your looking for.  "IMHO"  The Mad Dogs are a more fun listen.  While the Paradox is more neutral across the board.  A little more bass in the Mad Dogs.  Paradox will give you the bass when the track asks for it - What ever the track calls for the Paradox will give it to you (a little on the unforgiving side)  The Mad Dogs are more forgiving so the track could be a bad recording but the Mad Dog will make it sound a little better than what it is.
 
Hope this helps.  I like both equally - to me they compliment each other.  I was worried I was going to have the same headphone being both of them started out as T50RPs.  Not so.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) AKG K514 MKII - Detailed, clear, revealing, fast, lively, and has a wide range compared to my other headphones. Has better bass, midrange, and highs than my other headphones. Never sounds muffled. My other headphones sound unnatural and like trash in comparison. Most comfortable headphones I own. The drawbacks is that they are finicky with their source, will sound too sibilant and the treble will be too harsh on some equipment. Great value for the money.
 
2.) Sony MDR-MA300 - Sounds good for the price, comfortable. Has a pleasing tone that is slightly strange and a bit on the warm side with rolled-off treble.
 
3.) BRAINWAVZ HM5 - Sounds like a more refined and closed version of the Sennheiser HD 555 to me. Sounds a bit better than my Sony's but their clamp and stuffiness makes it hard to enjoy. Treble is rolled-off. They sound boring and too tame; much like the Sennheisers I've tried. My experience with Sennheiser is that they are boring, lifeless, and occasionally sound muffled. Too expensive for their sound quality.
 
I'm still a amateur audiophile, but I'm finally realizing what my sonic preferences are.

Looks as though we had similar impressions of the HM5s/XPT100s. Lifeless for sure... As though the entire sound spectrum was forced through a funnel and you get to hear the compressed result.
 
I will dub them Communist Headphones. Their quest for equality across the frequency range became so extreme that no sounds were allowed to be unique and all of them eventually lost their will to live.
 
Sad story...

MS-Pro ( older model )
SR325 ( all black vintage )
SRH940

K701 ( SAA cable )

K142HD ( Best $20 ever spent for new headphone )
Fidelio L1
.

Ultrasone Pro 650 ( one of the worse headphone I've eard) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Now that I have a bit more headphone experience...
 
-Stax SR-Lambda (THE headphone for me, in both comfort and sound presentation)
-Stax SR-202 (recessed midrange and higher clamping force are why it loses to the original Lambda)
-Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 (comfortable, excels at gaming, but seriously lacking in bass)
-Panasonic RP-HTF600 (cheap, reasonably comfortable with light clamping force, good at gaming, sounds good once burned in)
-Philips CitiScape Uptown (doesn't leak sound, reasonably balanced frequency response, but poor at gaming)
-Sansui SS-20 (needs new pads more than anything, being a vintage headphone with pleather pads that I haven't found decent replacements for yet)
 
-Sony MDR-CD180 (comfortable, sounded okay, but the headband snapped)
 
-no headphones
 
-GE H-22 (Worst. Headphone. EVER. I hope you only like mids, because this thing has no extension either way. Seriously, if you think you've heard the worst headphone ever, you've never heard these.)

 I've only heard 1 of the headphones with my current dac and amp which is the Dacport LX and Burson Soloist and that's the Terminator V4. All the rest I only heard straight from my computer sound card which is an X-Fi Titanium card. Maybe if I heard all the others with my new set up then my opinion would change, but even so I would still rate the LCD-2 above my current Terminator V4. Now I really wonder what the LCD-2's would sound like with my current set up. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Interesting that you rank the Terminator above the Deep Cup.  I've never owned the latter, but there were many that touted them over all other iterations. (save for the 600ohm driver transplants)  If not here, would you mind posting a comparison in the Darth thread that you've been so graciously keeping us up to date in?

Actually you're a purist, prefering to listen to unaltered audio rather than apply any sort of processing. It's not directly related to being a basshead :)
 
I personally much prefer to run an EQ, resampler, binaural and noise sharpening DSPs, as to correct hardware flaws (that every single piece of hardware has) or for fun listening sessions.

Haha, quite true. I found the 80 ohm more fun, but after I got the 250 ohm version to compare the rolled off treble of the 80 started to bug me and the lesser bass in the 250 ohm version couldn't really satisfy me. 
 
1.ATH-W1000X (some gaps in treble missing - a bit too coloured sometimes)
2.AH-D2000 (treble a bit harsh sometimes so I can't listen to them for too long)
 
3.Koss Porta Pro (not technically the best, but they're very easy to just pick up and use)
 
 
Those are all the all the headphones that I really care about at the moment. Unfortunately I can't really recommend any of them (besides the Porta Pros. Their cable is a weakness, but the edition with the cloth cable might fare better in that regard) and I'm still looking for the perfect headphones for me.
 
Based on my experiences, I'd probably try buy a AH-D7000 (2012 model) which I believe is supposed to be less harsh. Either that or a Fostex TH-900, but that costs more than double of anything that I currently own.

Beyer DT1350 - Tonally stunning, most neutral headphone I've heard so far, insanely short decay, it can handle any amount of splashy midrange pads and synths and keeps them all under control.  Very revealing of source, but rewards you when you have it.  One of the only headphones I listen to anymore, actually; it spoiled colored cans for me forever and started my love of linearity.  Not the biggest presentation, which leads to my second pair, but it's big enough for portable use, and the seal you get with these is phenomenal.  There's too much for me to gush over here; every section, the DT1350 excels at, bar the aforementioned soundstage/width.
 
Pioneer SE-700 - I want to hear these amped with an E9/Lyr before replacing them; they take SO much power.  Think a DT1350 with a much larger presentation, but missing the bass and a little of the treble on the very top.  Even though it's rolled off, these are very linear inbetween, which I admire, and their presentation is larger, so I use them as a full size alternative to the DT1350s at home.  Probably going to replace this spot with the K701 soon.
 
Grado RS2i - A genre headphone, but it does it nicely, although the nasal quality of the mids keeps me from listening to them all that often, I really have a fetish for neutral/linear tonalities >_<
 
Stanton Dynaphase Sixty - An interesting one, it's more for fun and bass than anything, it has quite awful decay, exhibiting the standard splashy mids/bloom that 70s cans are known for, but it has a stupid capacity of volume and bass, and a nice tonality when the vents are sealed, kind of like an M50 that doesn't suck.  Also they're gorgeous, but massive, yet comfortable.
 
Everything Else - I just don't listen to anything else >_>

Nice...I've had mine for 6 months just about and still am amazed every time I put them on my head. To date, the best $270 headphone Ive ever heard - portable or otherwise.

Pioneer SE-700: Best headphone I own so far. Nice detail retrieval, a good sense of rhythm, nice imaging, and nice airy sound. A little thin at times. Bass is just not there, which makes a few songs less exciting. Mids are nice and smooth, never nasally or boomy. Highs roll off at the very top but are otherwise quite nice. The sound is overall very smooth and flat. Very fun to listen to despite their analyticality. Unamped, they are unlistenable. Out of my E7 they do get better, but not as good as they could be. Driving them from my desktop subwoofer's speaker taps kills what bass they do have(as the subwoofer has an internal equalizer to keep the bass out of the satellite speakers), but makes everything else sound absolutely unbelievable.
 
AKG K240 Studio: Warm. Moderate detail retrieval, moderate attack and decay. Small soundstage, meh imaging. Tight, controlled, airy bass response. Liquidy mids and highs smoother than butter. Some of my denser music (such as Psyborg Corp.) turns into a disgusting mess on these. Not good for all genres. Most comfortable headphone I have ever worn.
 
Pioneer SE-500: Basically, everything the SE-700 is like, but worse in all departments. Had these before the SE-700s. Loved them too before I got the 700s.
 
KOSS K/6x Plus: First "real" headphone, got from a garage sale for $10 when I was 12. Bright. No soundstage, no imaging. Skeletal, light design makes them fall off my head easily and makes it sometimes hard to get a good seal. Very tight bass that reaches low but not very low, stops around 13 Hz. Sparkly highs that are a little bit rough. They are neutral with a slight tilt towards bright. Very well-detailed.
 
Audio Technica ATH-M50: I really don't like these anymore. Meh detail retrieval, meh attack/decay. Midbass hump, fairly tight low end but not as good as it could be. Absolutely disgusting midrange, heavy distortion and roughness throughout the entire range. Highs jump out at you, scream in your face, and smack you across the cheek. It's not quite harsh, but it is definitely noticeable and to be honest I don't enjoy it very much.
 
Audatron SH-608R (heavily modded): I took the driver off the baffle and secured it in the back of the earcup. I removed the original pads and substituted AKG pads. I messed around with the damping a lot and removed the two volume potentiometers in the earcups. Doing this made the sound airy and delightful and made the soundstage huge. They still have no imaging, however. The bass is no longer suffocating and the mids aren't boomy anymore. They're basically a worse K240 Studio, with less treble and more bass. Pretty bad but they have more bass than any headphone I have so they still get some use.
 
Audatron SH-608R (stock): Absolutely atrocious. Muddy bass that overwhelms the other ranges, boomy mids, no treble. Sound is very suffocating and oxygen-deprived. No soundstage and no imaging. Slow attack and decay and meh detail. Pretty heavy. Bad isolation, but better than most. Uncomfortable as sin. Thin supra-aural pads and way too much clamping force. Only redeeming qualities are nice, tough build quality and appealing visual aesthetics. 
 
Unranked:
KOSS Reference One: Just got these yesterday. Huge KOSS cans from the 70's. The bass reaches low, the highs are sparkly and smooth, and the detail is good. Absolutely massive soundstage with good imaging and instrument placement. They're heavy and built like a tank. They squeeze hard and isolate better than any headphone I've ever heard, and they don't leak at all. They seem to be extremely analytical... not sure how to rank it yet though.

1. HD650 - Main music rig.
2. Terminator V4 - They get the least use, but for that 5% (hip hop, dubstep etc) they are truly awesome.
3. Dt 770/80 - monitoring, movies, and late night listening
4. SR 60 - modded, primarily work cans
5. S4i - mobile w/ iPhone
I really like them all, and with the exception of the V4s, they all see regular use. Ironically, though, the V4s are what I'm least eager to upgrade. Well, I guess the dt770s are great for their purpose as well.

What is the rationale for ranking like this? It is of course correct, but based on what? Classical music? Dubstep? 
 
The music genre is more significant than the equipment feeding it.

Or if there was a fire in the house and you had the chance to grab 1 headphone - which one would it be - type of question.

No ranking from me since i only have beyer T1's. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

He, he. Tricky question. 
 
No - I would say the two others convey a "brighter" sounds signature that fits subject genre better. Others may feel different and that's OK of course. Having said that, classical is not my favorite genre - nor is country. But, I listen to these genres and enjoy it in between other preferences of music.

I finally have a full placement for the R1s.
 
The bass reaches low and has amazingly thick body and presence. It's thundering and powerful without being overwhelming or muddy, and is IMHO one of the best features of this set. The mids aren't as smooth as my SE-700s but are still quite good. There may be just a <tiny> amount of grain to them. The highs sparkle a lot more than the SE-700s and K240s but doesn't quite extend as much as the K240s. It's still only a very tiny roll off in the very top part of the spectrum so it's barely noticable. The detail retrieval beats everything I have and the fast attack and decay gives lots of PRaT. These things make music sound less like a recording and more like a performance. Absolutely awesome.
 
Out of the E7, they sound better than my SE-700s do. However, when the SE-700 gets the power it wants, it soars above and beyond my other sets in every aspect except bass extension, so I'm still ranking it in second place. They still get more ear-time than anything else I have though.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Too hard to say. I've spent enough time with most of my headphones to know where their individual strengths and weaknesses lie. I'm usually enjoying the one sitting on my ears the most because the genre of music chosen I believe best suits that particular headphone. Come to think of it I can only answer for the #1 spot - HE6! (I still can't definitely claim they have any weaknesses) The AHD-7000 and the lower tier iems (which I haven't listened to in over a year) are enjoyed least. As for the others it really is a genre tossup.

Headphones that I can't live without:
1.) Grado sr-225i
Great for listening to high quality recordings and hearing lots of detail, an all around great pair of cans but lacking a little in the bass section
2.) Klipsch s5i (now called s4 rugged I think)
Great for listening on the go, they make lower bit rate music sound great and they don't break the bank. Their sound is unique I would definitely recommend listening to a pair before buying.

Sorry, I didn't realize there was more than one.
 
I have the plastic-n-foam, US$17, Titanium KTXPro1. I think it's a good deal for the price.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Ah, ok.
 
Just trying to find some opinions on the 4AAAT.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Is this the open or closed one? (So many A's - so little time).
If the closed one - I'd say it's a pass. If it's the open one - I have no opinion and have not heard them. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I have that. Let's just say that i'm a DJ100 fanboy and my 4AAAT is in the closet collecting dust. I hate it.
I don't know why, but it's very muffled sounding and seems to have this weird plasticy resonance or something.
It's kind of hard to describe. I have only maybe 30 hours of burn-in on it. It was a used pair in near mint condition.
 
I tried to close them up but they don't sound any better.
 
Despite the titanium driver, this pair doesn't seem to have enough treble at all. It's very dark. The sound is pretty full, but again, muffled.
 
I think it must require 200 hours of burn in or something.
 
I don't think Koss would release a headphone this bad, so maybe something weird is going on?
 
The Pro4AAT is supposed to be much better i've heard.
 
I'll give the 4AAAT another 100 hours of burn in to see if anything changes.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Sennheiser HD 598. 9/10. I would give it 10 out of 10 if the bass was better, but besides that, it is absolutely fantastic.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

These are for my open heaphones:
 
AKG Q701 -
One headphone that gets nearly everything right for me. It's not forgiving at all though and bad/harsh tracks can be a little annoying. Mine is quite warm and full sounding. No goofy sounstage and those lean mids of the K702. I'm using a DIY Canare cable with it now and it now sounds closer to the HD-598, but with more treble and a clearer sound. IMO with the Canare this headphone would be ruined if it had any more bass or was even warmer. I don't really love it's angled pads though. The bumps don't bother me. Sorry, but this headphone is worth investing in a nice dac/amp for. I bought my Headroom Micro Amp just for this and the HD-650. Totally worth it  My ODAC made this even better and even more balanced sounding. No kidding..
 
AKG K601 (tied with HD-580)
This is one headphone i'll keep forever. Sounds like it has fuller  mids than the Q701 at times, yet it seems to have less bass.  Sometimes I can't figure out this headphone. It's mids often seem less forward than that of the Q701. I would say this sounds slightly more balanced than the Q701 (at times). It's treble is a bit smoother. The negative of this headphone is that it's worse than my Q701 on harsh/fatiguing tracks. Not sure why. Not as clear or detailed as the Q701. Comparing this to the Q701 is just so annoying. BTW it does have better imaging than the Q701. I think it's due to the pads. This has not been used much since getting the Q701.
 
Sennheiser HD-580 (tie)
I got this for $150 and thought it'd sound the same as the HD-600. Wrong! I find it sounds like a slightly more fun version of the HD-600. Perhaps less bass, a clearer sound and more forward upper mids. Not huge differences, but very slight. The soundstage is rather small for an open headphone. This seems to have more treble than my HD-598 somehow! I tried my HD-600 grills on this and it turns it into a snore fest. I prefer this with stock cable. Looks like I'm not the only one out there who thinks this sounds better than the HD-600!
 
Sennheiser HD-598
This is one smooth sounding headphone. For me it's very musical and perfect for asian pop. Especially the type with female vocals. This is what I'd suggest for those with budget amps under $100 and want a good all rounder. It won't please bassheads though. With the MAP pricing, it's hard to suggest this over the Q701. I don't think it's worth $250. This even manages to sound straight out of my Clip+! With my setup right now my HD-598 actually sounds like it has less treble than my HD-580. Strange.
 
AKG K240 Studio
One of the best budget headphones there is. Mine seemed a lot bassier out of the box, but this went away somehow. Despit being being 55 ohm, it needs an amp.
 
Sennheiser HD-600
Puts me to sleep and no I don't find it neutral, but close. That wasn't why. I can only like this with mods. Something weird about it's bass. I think the upper/mid bass causes some sort of fog over the entire signature. Modding it fixes this and really clears up the sound. My HD-580 doesn't have this issue. Despite being called "fun", I think the HD-580 sounds more balanced.
 
Audio Technica ATH-AD300
Slightly better than the AD700. Fuller mids, more bass and way less treble. Discontinued. I got it at Wal-mart for $35!!
 
Koss A/250
There's something special here, but too bad it's kind of thin and has too much treble. I think a tube amp might be the only way for me to stand it's sound. I'm a semi treble head too.
 
AD700
not enough bass, thin, too much treble. Sounds weird. Sounds clear and is detailed (don't say it).
Terrible fit if you have a small head. Yes, I'd buy a headphone (such as this) just for gaming.
What else has the soundstage, detail and clear sound of the Ad700 for under $100? Nothing!!
The HD-668B comes close in several areas, but that is more V-shaped in signature.
 
AKG K240 Sextett LP
Probably the worst headphone I have right now. Very muffled sounding with a severe lack of treble. The treble only comes back if I remove the inner foam. Then it's too thin! Maybe mine is a lemon.
 
Koss Pro4AAAT
Yuck! Don't know what's wrong here, but actually this is nearly as bad as my Sextett LP. Maybe both are lemons. Maybe this needs 200000 hours of burn-in. Sounds very, very dark without much treble. Very muffled.

No, there is a closed, modern, PRO4 with Titanium drivers. To the Koss-mobile!
From the Koss-mobile:
It appears that the closed model is "PRO4AAT" and the open model is "PRO4AAAT" - like I said, too many A's to keep it all straight. So it would be the "AAT" that is a pass.

I've added some cans, should probably re-list, based on preference not performance:
For Music:
1. Grado RS-1
2. Koss ESP/950
3. Ultrasone PRO2900
4. Sony MDR-F1
5. Audio-Technica ATH-ESW9
6. Bose AE2

2. Bose AE2
3. Sony MDR-F1
4. Koss ESP/950
5. Koss TBSE
6. Audio-Technica ATH-ESW9
7. Grado RS-1
The music list is a relatively tight grouping, the gaming list 1-4 are tight, 5-7 are rarely used in that capacity.

Have you heard the AE1? I prefer the AE1 to the AE2. People can punch me if they want, but I prefer the AE2 to even the Creative Aurvana Live. It's not as bad as people tend to say. The problem is that it's fairly overpriced.
 
I used the AE1 for maybe 2 years once and always loved it. I think my CD player was kind of warm though and that may have helped. This was back when nobody used mp3 players!
 
Despite what people say, I don't think the AE1 or AE2 have bloated bass. My AE1 has too much treble if anything..actually it's on loan to my mom. She loves it! I bought mine for $40.

Yes I had the original AE years ago (I even put a review up back in like 2008 - it was promptly flamed to RIBBONS; at the time I had the K701 and ESP/10 as primary cans to comapre with - I found the AE1 just as good for gaming, more comfortable, and up to the task with a lot of music, but the K701 and ESP/10 (ESPecially (har har!) more accurate/detailed).
I've actually tried both versions of the AE2, the original silver/black, and the new white one (I currently have the white one) - I didn't love the original, it was very microphonic. The white one fixed that - took me a week to figure out why: gloss paint. It makes the enclosure smoother and when you touch it/bump it it doesn't go "THUD." I doubt they even knew they'd fixed a problem. 
Sound-wise it's tough for me to compare them - I haven't heard an original TriPort in YEARS, while I have AE2 sitting on my desk right now. I like'em, especially for gaming. Regarding the pricing - tough to say, of all of the $0-$200 headphones I've tried in the last year or so, they're one of the only ones I've kept and really liked (TBSE being another), so on one hand I think "yes it's fair" but I'm also reminded of the day of the original TriPort - when an HD 580 was maybe $225-$250, and HD 600s were going for around $300. Or even today, with the $50 TBSE sitting next to them on the same shelf. And in that regard, sure, they're a bit rich. But they provide fantastic isolation and insane amounts of comfort relative to that (they're up there with the MDR-F1 for comfort, yet provide more isolation than the M50), so that's a neat trick at least. Compared to all of the modern "celebrifones" they're leagues ahead, both in comfort and in sound.
I will say, sound aside, the AE2 has a few upgrades over the AE that I like - like the removable cable, single-entry cable, and flat-folding cups. Shame the cable uses a 2.5mm TRS on the headphone side though - kinda kills options for third party stuff (like something shorter than what it comes with).Edited by obobskivich - 11/9/12 at 12:32am

Hey obobskivich, do you recommend the AE2s over the QC15s? I ask because you were a big influence in my decision to purchase the QC15s. What separates the 2 as far as sound quality goes? Why do you like the AE2s for gaming and how are they different from the QC15s in that regard? Thanks!

1. Sennheiser HD 600. 
Neutral. Just playing the song, nothing more. Not trying to over do anything. Can lissen to this can for hours and days without any fatiuge.
 
2. DT 990.
My fun phone. When I want a can that actually overdo some things like soundstage - bass - highs. Cant lissen to this one for hours but sometimes when I reach for eletronic or metall this can plays its roll and does it really well. 
 
3. Sennheiser HD 650.
Got replaced by the HD 600. I would actually choose this before my DT 990, but because of the HD 600 this can got really more or less useless for me. In comparison with HD 600 this can is a little bit to dull and in the long race I actually get more ear fatigue because of that.

Original post edited to show my headphone rankings based on audio chain. Of the cans I've spent considerable time with...
 
1. Audio-GD Reference 1 > Stax srm-323s > Stax 007 mk2
This was my roommates setup. Sound is very euphonic, smooth and lush, with a huge soundstage. The reference 1 DAC was critical part of the chain. The 007 did not sound as magical with my Antelope Zodiac Plus,  Audio-gd NFB10ES, and even my less burned-in Reference 7 at the time.
 
2. Antelope Zodiac Plus > Earmax > Sennheiser HD650
Sound is very musical, euphonic, and vocals are lifelike with a lot of emotion. I can listen to this combination endlessly without any listener fatigue. The Zodiac took away the hd650 veil and was better fit than the darker Reference 7. The Earmax and HD650 has amazing synergy, and tube rolling is a lot of fun.
 
3. Antelope Zodiac Plus OR Audio-gd NFB10ES > Audeze LCD2 r2
I'm sure a better amp would have me rank the LCD2 past the HD650. Both the Zodiac and the Sabre-based NFB10ES, neutral DACs leaning towards bright side, has good synergy with the slightly warmer LCD2 r2. Sound is clear, organic, great timbre, lifelike vocals, and dark background. Soundstage is a bit constricted. I really enjoy the LCD2s but they don't move me emotionally as the earmax/HD650 combination.
 
4. Reference 7 OR Antelope Zodiac Plus > Duntonic 300B integrated tube amp > Hifiman HE6
I understand why so much praise is reaped on the HE6's. I've had a privilege of hearing a TOTL setup that properly amped the HE6's and the sound was very impressive with its realism and transparency - I felt transported to a live concert. I felt the transparency was on par with the Stax 009. However, the HE6 is a PITA to properly amp, and all the amps in my collection either ran out of juice (earmax, phoenix) or sounded bright, harsh, sibilant, and fatiguing with it (NFB10ES, DIY First Watt F3). I have read that brightness with HE6 is a symptom of underamping. The 300b tube amp put up the best fight and smoothed out sound a bit. Its important to note that I needed to get resisters to make the tube amp sound right with the HE6's. One cool thing about the HE6 is that the sound has a physically tactile feel to it which I've never experienced with another headphone. The tactile feel is not only with bass (e.g., rumbling), but across the frequency range. Its a really cool effect.
 
5. Antelope Zodiac Plus > Audio-gd Phoenix > Denon D7000
The Zodiac Plus has good synergy with the Denon's and gave them a more neutral/flat sound signature. The D7000s with my NFB10ES had a more V-shaped sound that veiled the midrange and added some harshness and sibilance. The D7000s are fun headphones though and was my headphone of choice for watching movies before I sold them off. I regret selling them as they were very comfortable to wear, gorgeous to look at, and leaked less sound due to closed design.
 
So there you have it - my rankings in context!
 
For my personal enjoyment and synergy with my components, I would rank...
 
Stax 007 mk2 > HD650 > LCD2 > HE6 > D7000.
 
For technical superiority and scalability, I would rank...
 
Stax 007 mk2 > HE6 > LD2 > HD650 > D7000

It depends. The QC15 have ANC, which makes them far and away better isolating. They're also less microphonic. SQ wise it really depends as well - in a noisy environment the QC15 have ANC to their advantage, which is a big deal (things will sound consistent in noisy or quiet environments, while the AE2 like most other full-size cans lack LF isolation and will sound funky in noisy places). Additionally the QC15 are a bit more refined and have more bass impact (it still doesn't bleed into everything else). They're certainly a "grown up" sound over the AE2 (my understanding is that there is some complex EQ and DSP processing going on to accomplish this though, which is why they can't run without power). When it comes to gaming, I like the AE2 because they're very light, comfortable, closed-back, and have a decent sound-stage. The QC15 were just as competent, plus they added ANC onto the top. It really put you "in the game" - for better, or for worse.
My biggest issue with the QC15 is that I don't need ANC, and I didn't like needing to replace the batteries. The effect was also fairly uncanny to me (in my scenario, it absolutely obliterated the world around me - it was like sensory deprivation, which isn't something I enjoy).
So, if you need the isolation, and what a bit more refined take on the Bose sound; or want a bassier presentation, and don't mind the batteries - QC15.
Otherwise, or if you're opposed to ANC or on a budget - AE2.
Both are good closed cans imho.

lol. Unless you need to anchor a boat or something... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Oh, the 4AAs are far better than the QC15 AND the AE2. KOSS still produces them.
 
If the current production versions have the same pads as the old, they'll isolate amazingly without the stupidness of ANC. The comfort is actually quite good except for the weight, and the sound quality is still better than the QC15.

HD-800 - Comfort, sound, sound, sound, did I say sound?
 
LCD-3- Close to first place. May change in time not sure, have only used them like 5 times since September
 
HD-650 - I really thought about putting these as number 1 but can't because they really are not in the same league as the two above. These are just all around fun,  Light and 80% of the SQ of the above.  For the price you can't really argue. Must have.
 
Klipsch x10 - Decent on the go. The highs just don't seem right with these.  I don't think there was ever a time I forgot I was listening to in ears with these.

You, sir, are a man of impeccable taste!
 
Seriously, I think the price is keeping T5ps under-exposed. Most head-fiers would go for a T1 at that price or (fill in the blanks with your aspirational USD1,295 'phone here), given that they already own amps of some description and graduated from portables (read: low impedance/high sensitivity). Plus the T5p really is a little large (and conspicuous) for portable use - but don't tell that to the Red/White Dre Studio users!

Can you give a brief impression of the Darth Beyer V3s?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Bass heavy phones, controlled and deep. The lows these things can hit are nuts. Trebles are smooth, definitely still a bit of a recession of the mids though.
Overall the signature is exactly what I love.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Got some new headphones, so I revised the order.
 
1: Beyerdynamic DT1350
Neutral with insane bass and treble extension. Fastest decay of any headphone I've ever heard. LOTS of detail, good imaging and small but enjoyable soundstage. Really good isolation. Has a certain viscerality to it that makes things sound real.
 
2: Pioneer SE-700
Very neutral sound. Slightly clearer sound than the DT1350, but has less extension on the lows and highs. Very detailed, possibly more than the DT1350. Phenomenal imaging, sound just emanates from nowhere. No soundstage, however. Bass lacks slam and heft. No isolation. Requires a metric f-ckton of amping power.
 
3: KOSS Pro/4AAA
Neutral with a slightly darker sound compared to the DT1350. Bass doesn't reach as low as the 1350 but is still very good. Highs roll off a bit at the very top. Absolutely massive soundstage with amazing imaging. Instrument separation is great. Songs sound less like a recording and more like a performance. Has detail but not as much as 1350, isolation is about on par with 1350.
 
4: KOSS Reference One
Same general sound as the 4AAA but even darker due to less treble. Upper midrange is slightly forward and it feels like there's a veil of sorts over the sound. Slightly smaller soundstage than 4AAA. STUPIDLY good isolation, the best I've ever heard from ANY headphone.
 
5: Pioneer SE-500
An SE-700 that's worse in every way. Has less bass, less detail, and kinda distant sounding. Significantly easier to power however, and offers some isolation.
 
6: KOSS K/6X Plus: Bright with sparkly treble and good bass. Semi-open. Has tight control over the entire frequency spectrum. First pair of headphones I ever owned. Lacks soundstage and imaging, and doesn't have much detail, but still pretty good.
 
7: ATH-M50
Don't like it anymore. Midbass hump without much of anything for real bass. Rude treble that jumps out at you and slaps you across the face. Recessed mids that are grainy and bad sounding. No actual detail, no soundstage or imaging. 
 
8: AKG K240 Studio
Nice airy lows, liquid mids, beautiful highs... but has absolutely no control over the diaphragm. No detail, no PRaT, no heft, no anything. Puts me to sleep every time I use it. Dense songs are a sloppy mess of frequencies on these headphones.
 
9: Audatron SH-608R 
A K240 studio without the smoothness to the sound. Even more asleep, with no soundstage and no imaging. Used as a guinea pig for modding.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Koss Pro DJ 100
Don't get me started..just the idea that it holds up to my HD-650 on my main setup explains a lot. It's just not the same from portable devices for me. Despite it supposedly being easy to amp.
IMO it's sound is held back a lot by it's stock pads.
 
2. Sennheiser HD-650
I don't know why this pair sounds better than the other pairs I had 2 years ago. This one is quite balanced. No lack of treble, no mid-bass hump and good low bass extension. Vocals (not just male) sound forward slightly. This sounds closer to my old modded HD-600. This benefits from my ODAC more than my Q701. I also checked the setup I had before and this one sounds like nothing sticks out too much. Ok, it's still sounds really warm. Hopefully everyone else has one that sounds this good! Since getting this i've been addicted to it's sound and even use it with gaming. With the ODAC it certainly doesn't lack detail and isn't too forgiving of track quality at all. It IS however fairly forgiving of all those tracks that are normally harsh/fatiguing (bad recording).
 
3. AKG Q701
This isn't going anywhere. I still love this thing, but lately i've been wanting to try other headphones. I find the Q701 more accurate than the HD-650, but who cares.
 
4. Sennheiser HD-580
Think i'm one of the few who find this sounds better than the HD-600.
 
5. AKG K601 (this sounds ruler flat with my ODAC. Weird)
 
6. Sennheiser HD-598 (somehow this thing never gets any use. I love it's soundstage (size).

Even at home, I always listen to the first 4 through a Neco V3 with AD8610 op amps. Never listen to the other 3 listed.
1. Sennheiser HD600 (can listen to these for hours, always sound great, the amp makes an excellent combination)
2. Audio Technica ATH-50 (not quite broken in, have not listened unamped, some clamping but comfort is better than other closed cans I've tried)
3. Sennheiser PX100 (portable, lightweight, used 1st generation until one side shorted out, 2nd generation's sound doesn't seem as good but probably don't have enough hours for full break-in)
4. MEElectronics M6 (good inexpensive IEMs, my ears are hard to fit for in-ear but these with triple flange work fine)
5. Sennheiser HD 497 (not horrible but not great, still own these but haven't seen them since last move)
6. Koss Porta Pro (I know some people love these, but I never warmed up to them, also don't like the metal headband).
7. Sennheiser PX200 (the sound is too dark for my liking)

1. Hifiman HE-400
Monsters. Love them for all types of music. I just love the unique planar sound, detail and the ability to produce such impactful bass for open headphones. Soundstage maybe not the same as some dynamic open cans but for me more than wide enough. Usually drive them from my PC (Foobar2k -> Audioengine D1 -> Matrix Mstage)
 
2. Beyerdynamic DT1350
Just got these a few days ago and they are going to be my no.2 can for a while. In a lot of ways the seem more cohesive to me than the Hifimans. Probably more enjoyable mids for vocals, and they do percussion extremely well. Listening to a track with saxophone right now and it feels like it is in the room with me.. Will mostly be driving these with E17. Though I might start to use these at home too, maybe for making music (production), they're just that good. Bottomless subbass.
 
3. Ultrasone Pro-900
Just a great fun headphone, with a lot of detail. Hugely boosted mid-bass, and really only good for electronica (which is mostly what I listen to). Amazing with Drum n Bass / Dubstep, uncomparable thump from kickdrums and powerful subbass with a lot of DnB too. Some tracks seem to go just that bit too low for them to reach though, whereas so far it seems like the DT1350s CAN reach, which is amazing for such small supra-aural headphones. These are my office/work headphones with the E17; they're good for that.
 
4. Shure SRH-840
These served me well for a while as studio headphones for making music, and for audio recording (interviews and field audio for video work).
I'm now going to sell them because of the list of superior cans above that I now own. Quite neutral, reasonably detailed, but very boring IMO. Lacking in bass.
I used to think the Shure build quality was good, but I know better now. Yes they are solid and will take some knocks, but they feel cheap and plasticky (because, well, they are).
 
The other headphones I used to have before I got my HE400s were the Beyer T70s. Wasn't my preferred sound signature, though they were impressive in a lot of ways.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Audeze LCD-2: Best sounding headphone for most genres in my collection. Still burning in with the Lyr but getting smoother each day. If it were lighter and didn't clamp my head so tightly, I would wear it more often.
 
2. Sennheiser HD600: First audiophile headphone. Not as clear as the LCD-2's but are very impressive. The most comfortable headphone I own. I sometimes prefer this "sound" to the LCD-2s. Perhaps I should take a look at the Hifiman HE-500.
 
3. Sennheiser HD555
 
4. Sennheiser HD280
 
5. Audio Technica ATHM-50S: Birthday gift. Sounded bland and muddy. Don't listen to them much but often lend them out to friends who want to get Beats by Dre to try to persuade them to not get the Beats. It works sometimes and they buy me a beer. Good deal.
 
6. Shure e2c: I was in an orchestra and I was forced to buy these. I absolutely hated the way they fit in my weirdly shaped ear, but they sounded decent enough.
7. Klipsch S4
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

#1 - HD 650's....so easy to get along with, sounds good with every bit of music. Wish they were easier to drive from portables, sound amazing on high end amps and dacs. 
 
#2 - Alessandro MS-Pros.... My favourite for a long time, guitar and rock specialist, probably better sounding than the HD 650's for short periods but no where near as good for long periods.
 
#3 - AD900's...The first audiophile cans I ever bought, still love them. 
 
#4 - Atrio M5's....WAY WAY better than my broken Shure 420's, for half the price, they are my travel headphone, bassy and sound great!
 
#5 - DT 250....Incredibly boring and over hyped closed headphone, bought them after been highly recommended they bore the **** out of me.

1. sennheiser hd 430 - wide sound stage, its  sound heavenly with little dot  mk3 (personally sounds better then hd 650)
2. audeze lcd - 2.2 - sounds goood,  can not hear the true potential yet cause lacks on source and amp.
3. shure srh 1840 - sounds great but lacks on detail and soundstage
4. Dt 990 pro - good bass

1. HD800 - Clarity and soundstage to die for. They rip apart poorly recorded tunes, but feed them quality and enjoy a heavenly listening experience.
2. T40RPs DBV#3 modded - Excellent all rounders. My top choice for a p/p rig or a single can rig.
3. HD650 - I love these cans. They get the most headtime due to their easygoing presentation and forgiveness of poorly mastered music.
4. Thunderpants - Very colored. Great for basshead music. These cans thump very well. The O2 pads provide great isolation and a better soundstage than the 840 pads used on the T40RPs.Edited by Draygonn - 12/6/12 at 6:56pm

1.  Stax Lambda Pro - very light on the head, and just a great experience.  Drawback is the large electrostatic amp - can't move it around.  Sounds oddly different when lying down - they reposition on the head.  Clear and clean.  Cost a fortune when I bought them new so very long ago - although a few grand today seems like nothing.  Used a few times a week.
 
2.  HD-650 - So very comfortable and light, I can just wear these all day.  Like an Eames lounger, they invite you in for a long stay.  A bit "dark", but after you have them on for an hour, you don't notice anymore.  Just pleasant.  Use them every day.
 
3.  HD-25 - Great portable, even with the flaws.  Use every day at work.
 
3.  Both Grados (SR325 and MS1) - they just aren't comfortable, although the SR325i is not bad, I am a bit sensitive to the Grado sound - I don't like the treble spike.  I find these excellent for low volume listening until they get too uncomfortable.  Not bad, just not my style.  They are the low volume champs, though.  Almost never used
 
5.  The IEMs (ER4s, UM2) - I just don't like something stuck in my ear, and the Westones only seal easily and correctly one time in ten.  They have to be very easy to use - I don't like messing with a seal for 5 minutes every time, only to break the seal to hear and talk.  Call it operator error.  Almost never used.
 
I use music to relax, so I don't care for anything that pushes the music into my face.

My current headphones in order of personal preference:

I really only use the Q701 and the GR01, the rest I still do own though.

Alessandro MS2i's (warm,rich,full sound) used with ADCOM-GTP400,SONY CDP-701es,MERIDIAN 203DAC  sound beutiful to my ears. I listen to mostly smooth/lounge jazz,grunge,60's-70's, classic/soft rock, I especially like them for the jazz types due to their detail.

I only recently became a headphone enthusiast, but I have picked up three sets of cans:
 
1. Hifiman HE-400 - I've had these for about 2 weeks now and they are a noticeable step up from my other two sets. Fantastics phones.
 
2. Sennheiser HD558 - This is the second set of cans I got after being blown away by my Shure SRH840s. When I first got them, they were a little closed sounding, but after some burn in and the tape mod, these now have a full, warm, and very engaging sound.
 
3. Shure SRH840 - The set that opened my eyes to the possibilities. I only just barely prefer the Senns to these. They have a very pleasing, warm tone with good detail, but when I heard the Senns, these suddenly sounded a bit colored and less "organic."
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yet another headphone (two actually) and some other changes.
 
1: Sony MDR-SA3000: 
Bright and super detailed. Amazing soundstage. Entire sound spectrum is airy and expansive, and the highs are beautiful. Detailed yet smooth. Light and comfy. Bass-light, doesn't work well with some genres. Open backed, no isolation. Very easy to drive but is very revealing of poor equipment and source. Build quality on these scares me a bit, they feel like I should be very gentle with them.
 
2: Beyerdynamic DT1350: 
Neutral, lots of detail. Analytical as hell. Fastest decay of any headphone I've heard. Absolutely bottomless low end and awesome treble extension. Small but good soundstage. Comfort is just about as good as a supra-aural can is gonna get. Easy to drive, but very DAC dependent. 
 
3: KOSS Pro/4AAA: 
Neutral with a slight tilt towards dark. Has rolled off treble. Awesome soundstage, especially for a closed can. Bass extends very low but rolls off after 15Hz. Nicely detailed, good decay. Needs an amp. Fairly heavy. Not the most comfy can in the world but not uncomfortable by any means. Nearly perfect isolation.
 
4: Numark HV-215V: 
Warm. Good treble and good bass. Slightly larger soundstage than DT1350. Not much detail but still has some. Slightly heavy but by far the most comfortable supra-aural can I've ever worn save for the unpadded headband. Easy to power. Doesn't have much sub-bass and the clarity isn't optimal, but still a good headphone.
 
5: Pioneer SE-500:
Small soundstage with the best imaging I've ever heard. Sound just emanates from nowhere. Good highs, good mids. Slightly less detail than the Pro/4AAA. Absolutely bass-less. Bad isolation. Requires a very powerful amp. Gets a little bit uncomfortable (hot) after a long listening session.
 
6: KOSS Reference One:
Very similar to the Pro/4AAA but even darker due to less treble. Deeper low end, but slightly veiled sound. Forward upper mids. Slightly smaller soundstage than 4AAA and less detail as well. Absolutely perfect isolation. I have never heard a headphone that isolates this well. Since I have the 4AAA, the only reason I'd use these is if I had to mow the lawn or something.
 
7: Pioneer SE-700:
Why did I rank the SE-700 lower than the 500? Pioneer tried too hard to give a piezoelectric headphone bass. Piezoelectric diaphragms aren't made to produce bass: the bass that the SE-700 has is sloppy and bad. It takes away from the rest of the sound. Otherwise it's almost identical to the SE-500. Maybe I'm not amping it properly. Maybe my unit has some QC issues. Idk.
 
8: KOSS K/6X Plus: 
Neutral with a tilt towards the bright side. Good sparkly treble. Slightly sloppy bass. Very sensitive. No real details, just fake treble detail. No soundstage, no imaging. Bad comfort, and the cable sucks. Can't use them due to a channel imbalance, but I'm holding onto them because they were my first headphone.
 
9: Audio Technica ATH-M50:
Don't like these anymore. Recessed and grainy mids, no real bass, extremely rude treble that jumps out at you from behind a corner and slaps you upside the head. No soundstage, no imaging. No real detail. Fairly comfortable but fall off my head way too easily. Keeping them because they were a gift.
 
10: AKG K240 Studio:
Tight airy bass, liquid mids, and beautiful highs, but has no control of the diaphragm. Doesn't have detail, and has very slow decay. Dense songs sound like utter **** on these. Very comfy and light, nice cable, good soundstage. Diffuse imaging. I want to love these headphones so much, but I just don't.
 
11: Audatron SH-608R: 
Wal-Mart clone of the Numark HV-215V. Very Beats-esque with a stupidly overwhelming midbass hump, no treble, and an absolutely piercing upper mids spike. No detail. Meh soundstage, meh imaging. Used as a guinea pig for mods. Might get rid of them.

1. Sony MDR-CD900ST
 
2.A. AKG K601
 
2.B. AKG K501: I'm definitely loving these headphones. Right now I'd put them about on par with the K601s, though I could see myself putting them above the K601s in the future. I really like the sound. Their treble is much more present, but not razor sharp, and their mid range is quite detailed. I'm also getting much better soundstage from these than I did with the K601s. The flip side, is they have much less bass, and I kind of liked the warmer mids of the K601s. The K501s at times sound just a touch thin, and with some music that fullness is a must. The other thing I like more on the K601s is the comfort. While it's still generally the same, the itchy pads set the K501s back a bit. I'm sure shaving the beard would probably remove that complaint, though! 
 
3. AKG K271
 
4. Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80
 
5. Sony MDR-7509
 
6. Ultrasone Pro 750

1. Sennheiser HD 600: These do everything right, and are ridiculously comfortable after reducing clamp - great all rounders.
2. Denon AH D7000: Fun fun fun headphones. Crystal clear, but a bit too much sub bass to be my go to cans.
3. Koss TBSE1: A budget headphone with great mids. I find myself reaching for these very often at home and for portable use.
4. Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro-80: Nice soundstage for closed cans. Great isolation, great bass, but recessed mids keep these on the shelf.
5. Grado SR225i: Energetic and addictive mids, but fatiguing signature. Amazing cans for 20 minutes at a time and for listening to vinyl.
6. Koss PortaPro: Fun, bassy little cans for on the go. I'd use them more often if they were more comfortable.
7. Audio Technica ATH M30: These lean toward neutral and are very easy to listen to. My first set of cans, so they have nostalgia value.
8. Audio Technica ATH M50: Bought these for portable use, and since the TBSE1's have replaced them, they have sat on the shelf unused.
9. Sennheiser HD 202: I liked these back in the day before I had my other cans. Muddy bass, and earcups are too small for over ear.

Ranking them according to how much I enjoy listening to them:
 
1. Sennheiser IE80 - great bass, nice soundstage and make almost everything I listen to sound perfect.
2. Sennheiser Momentum - Nicely balanced, very smooth sounding. I'd take these over the IE80s for live music (except for the soundstage, IMO).
3. Monster Turbine Pro Copper - Great detail retrieval, just enough tight bass and favourable isolation.
4. Astro A40 - Although a little light on the bass for me, they sound excellent with jazz and pop.
5. Beats by Dr. Dre Pro - For my EDM tastes, the Beats are simply awesome.
6. Koss Portapro - Bass-heavy, but good fun to listen to.
7. Bose QC15 - Top of the class for ANC, but they sound a little hollow to me (mids and highs). The bass seems out of place.
8. Sennheiser PX250 - They sound better to me than the QC15s, both in passive and active mode, but I can't get over that huge Noisegard thing and the on-ear fit.
9. Audio Technica CK500 'key' earphones - My sister's, but they're not terrible for $15.
10. Klipsch Image S4 - Bass bloat doesn't bother me so much with EDM, and they're best used on the go.
11. Apple Earpods - They sound much better than the iBuds, but I don't love the way they sound.
12. Astro A* Stars - They look pretty cool, but they're prone to sibilance, and the bass is out of control.
 
I've some Klipsch X10s coming in January. I wonder where they'll fit in?

Open: K701
 
Closed: SRH940
 
IEM: MH1C
 
I still own about 30 iems and 20 other cans, but i do not use them. Besides them, i would have liked to keep some more, but could not afford it. if the would still be mine, list would be as:
 
1. K701: Love them for their soundstage, details, silky smooth treble and deep and dry bass.
 
2. HD598: Compared it for a long time with the 701 and came to the conclusion, that while the soundstage of the senn is narrow, it extends so deep, you really think, that sound is coming from in front of you. loved it. but the akg takes an edge on detail and effortlessness.
 
3. SRH940: Never sounds like a close can. lots of air great rumbling deep bass, perfekt layering for movies.
 
4. UE11pro: Best detail, Best timbre, best separation, but very limited soundstage.
 
5. Custom TF10 (still owning it): Absolutely love the sound, but i hate the handling of custom shells, so they do not get any listening time anymore. the few times i need iems, i grab the mh1c over them.
 
6. Koss Pro 100DJ: Still own them and moded them to sound nearly as my srh940. wanted to use it as a portable, but it seems to be too bulky. not much a step forward in portability compared to my shures.
 
7. IE80: Still own them. sound good but well, its an iem.
 
All in all, i think, iems have more technical abilitys, but i simply cannot handle them any longer.

srh 940 and bass dont go very well together... I find the 940s bass to be anemic.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Not at all. They are sensitive to positioning on head, and with a mod (thickening of pads) , you can really unleash the bass.
Their bass extend extend very low too.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Oh I only tried them stock... I found the quantity quite lacking, but I agree the extension is very very good.

When did you get them? Better than the uptowns lol? Would getting the HD650's put a stop to the head-fi madness?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. hd650-with a good amp these are a talented performer. With a great amp, they are just down right talented. Uber comfortable. Exceptional fit and finish if you're okay with plenty of plastic. Incredibly musical with most material. You could buy these and a good amp and call it end game...well, I know that I could. 
 
Weakness-still looking 
 
2. Maddogs-I think somewhat of a darkhorse around here. Earning a reputation for a deliciously smooth orthodynamic sound. The signature is cohesive across the spectrum with a touch of warmth around the bottom end. Fantastic isolation and has a rugged tank like build. Scales about as well as the hd650. 
 
Weakness-some may consider the slight darkness a con...I don't. 
 
3. he400-despite taking some deserved heat for production issues, this is a beautiful headphone. The second best bass that I've ever heard. Only second to the lcd2r2. This is not flabby exaggerated or boomy bass. It is rich with texture and impact. Great with Jazz, Pop and anything with a nice bass-line. Very good sound stage and a good all rounder. 
 
Weakness-heaviest and least comfortable of the three. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The Maddogs are darker than the HD650?

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

^^ Yes. With the dogpads the maddogs are darker than the 650. The 650's, at least the newest version, is not as dark as what people say they are.

I'll tell it just like everyone else tells it. The Q701 is less warm and less bassy, and more treble happy. Overall it's more analytical and detailed. The HD650 is a great headphone, I just prefer the sound of the Q701. Plus, i can always EQ in a little more warmth and bass if I want it.

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

well my friend has the K601 which i actually like which is weird given how much i like the HD650. I struggle to like the sound of the beyers (personal prefs), so yea im looking for a second set of headphones, might check out the audio technica lounge tomorrow
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Don't get the 650 my friend.  It will ruin everything.  No more buying headphones all the time... what would you do?  My life is now over... :)
 
Seriously though.  With the right amp these things far surpass any ideas I previously had about them.  Very much worth their price tag IMO.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
That's what I am worried about also. I don't know if I can live without this "cheap-phones-buying-addiction" lol.
 

 
And the right amp seems to be the Lyr, so there's another $400    Maybe I will instead just stay addicted and continue going broke nice and slowly. Somics... here I come lol!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
That's the best way to go broke really. It softens the blow and the shock of it all.

Exactly why I buy vintage cans, that and general fascination with old ****. Lol.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I think the K701 are a nice compliment to the big Senns - brighter, more spacious, faster, but less musical. They go well together. The K701 being much less expensive kind of messes with that perception though (people tend to want to place it in "entry level" or "mid-fi" because obviously price tells us everything ).
Personally I don't have a solid 1-8 (or is it 1-10?) ranking of all of my cans, but I can say that recently my top four in terms of actual usage are:
- Koss ESP/950
- Ultrasone PRO2900
- Bose AE2w
- Grado RS-1i
The Bose are scoring "high" because I enjoy them for gaming and watching TV (they isolate, are very comfortable, and have a sufficient soundstage - also the kind of rolled-off top-end makes them among the least fatiguing headphones ever conceived (so listening to lots of explosions and gunshots, while less visceral, is also less obnoxious after 6-7 hours)), but I don't find myself using them for music that often (and inversely, the Grados score "lower" because I don't use them for gaming or TV, so all of their usage is music related (and I haven't had a lot of listening time this month)). The Koss and Ultrasone are very good at both roles. This isn't to say that the Grados cannot game, they just aren't...particularly awesome at it (dialog and some SFX sound uncanny good and they're very comfortable, but they fall short to most of my other cans in terms of soundstage size, and the lack of isolation can be bothersome too). Very much "built for music" these ones are.
This isn't really "engineered" either - it's just what I've been reaching for in the last few weeks. I still like the RS-1 best for music, the PRO2900 best for gaming, and the ESP/950 best all-around. In writing this I feel like I should give the MDR-F1 and TBSE some more headtime though.

I recently purchased the RE-ZEROS, and I'm so in love with them, i can't see myself loving another dynamic driver IEM the way I love these. They simply vaulted to the very top of my list of IEM's. They easily vaulted over my Sennheiser IE 80's, TF 10's, UE 500's, and MEE A151's. I'm looking into getting the Monster Miles Davis Trumpets (2nd gen), to compare to my ZEROS, but I have little faith in any other dynamic driver IEM touching the sweet smooth beautiful sound signature of my RE-ZEROS.
 
#1 HiFiMan RE-ZERO
 
#2 UE TF 10's
 
#3 Sennheiser IE 80
 
#4 UE 500
 
#5 MEE A151 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Audio Technica ATH-W1000X Mmmmm smooth and relaxing. Lovely forward mids, decent enough bass and smooth highs. They also look sexy.
2. Sennheiser Momentum Portable loveliness, ok not that portable as they don't fold or anything but they sound great unamped from my S3.
3. Klipsch Image X10 (I think it's x10 anyways, their first IEM) my first 'serious' pair of headphones. Superseded by the Momentums which give a much more relaxing detailed sound.
4. AKG K702 I don't like these, have very little bass, almost never use as not very satisfying to listen to, still here as I haven't got around to selling them over the last 2 years. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Thought I might just add my input here...
 
1. Sennheiser HD800
2. Sennheiser HD650
3. Audio Technica AD1000
4. Sennheiser HD25-1 II
5. Alienware TactX (Rebranded Steelseries 5Hv2)
 
I would say the AD1000s and the HD25s would be very close if I were to rank them. Even though the AD1000 does have rather problematic highs, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the recessed nature found in the HD25s which bothers me. Fortunately though, I really do like the way the bass is presented and even though I don't approve of the sparkly highs on their own, I find that the combination of the 3 attributes makes it amazingly fun to listen to.

I recently bought the UE 700's, which have replaced my RE-ZERO's as my favorite workhorse IEM. Sold my Sennheiser IE 80's, so my top 3 now goes something like this...
 
1. UE 700
2. HiFiMan RE-ZERO
3. UE TF 10
 
recent fun factor IEM with AMP : V-Moda Bass Freq Metal
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

It's really hard for the top 2, but here it goes
 
1. Grado Sr-80i WITH L-cush pads
2. Sennheiser HD518
3. Grado Sr-80i with S-cush pads
4. Sony MDR-XB500
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

LCD-2 > HD 650 > Westone um3x rc > ATH M50... Probably not a groundbreaking ranking...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I'm quite curious about the Westone um3x...how do they stack up against the TF 10's and 700's?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Surprised by your high rating of the UE 700, especially since it's actually quite cheap(for head-fi). Might go pick one up if I see it in the new year sales, or maybe the UE 900...hmm.
 
My top 5 would probably go like this:
1. Denon AH-D2000 with MarkL mod
2. Audio Technica ATH-A900X
3. Personally modded T50RPs(needs a bit more detail)
4. Shure SRH840
5. KRK KNS 8400
 
None of my IEMs really give me the same level of satisfaction as my headphones, but I don't have any flagship or near flagship IEMs yet. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Grado sr325is (stock pads)
2. Sennheiser HD650 and AKG K702 65th Anniversary (these get the most play time)
3. Sennheiser HD25-1 II (also love the fact that parts are owner serviceable/replaceable)
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

This is tough.
1. Sennheiser HD598   -  Bass is not as recessed as I thought it would be. Highs and mids are fantastic. Soundstage obviously very wide and good. A very relaxing, non fatiguing, enveloping    headphone. Some slight sibilance, I expect this to get better with burn in. I'm only about 8 hours in, and the fact they already sound fantastic is saying something.
 
2. V-Moda M80             - Really really smooth and digestible. Also, very warm to my ears, but that's not a bad thing. Bass extension is superb, and impact is adequate and non fatiguing. Mids are otherwordly. As mentioned before, highs are definitely the weakest, but not recessed. Relaxed maybe. Slightly congested because the mids and bass are forward, but then again, a lot of headphones sound congested compared to the HD598. Very fun. Easy to groove, headbang, chill. Awesome awesome headphones.
 
3. Sennheiser HD439   -  Obviously a league below the above, but still great nonetheless. Decent clarity and soundstage. I actually thought the bass was weak when I first heard these, which is funny cuz they advertise these as bass emphasized. Perhaps, because these were my first quality headphones, my tastes were still bass heavy. At any rate, I did the tape mod and the bass improved a lot. 
 
 
My next purchase will be something a little sharper/brighter than the above. Crystal clear. In your face. Any recommendations?

+1. Or if you want to talk about other polarizing options, the Sony SA5000 or an Ultrasone (especially with Ti drivers). 
Recent top 3 FWIW:
- Grado RS-1i
- Sony MDR-F1
- Bose QC15-LE 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Unfortunately I have not heard the TF 10's or UE 700's.  The Westones are the only IEMs I have heard in that price bracket as I got them for a price I couldn't pass up even without an audition.

Bose? Have you listened to the qc15's? They suck. Basically upperclass beats. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



the 700's rate quite high in head-fi reviews and on other audiophile sites. they are going for cheap now, since Logitech seems to be phasing out most of it's UE line, minus the 900. I think they might be gearing up to go towards more consumer grade/cheaper headphones like skullcandy, sony, philips, ect? The 700's provide crystal clear detail, substantial bass for a BA, and a warm fun sound signature. Are they perfect? no. Are they right up there with some of the other dual BA driver IEM's? yes they are.

My top 5 in order:
Fostex T50RP modded (Needs a little more midrange)
ACS T15
Sennheiser PXC450 (Needs a more fleshed out sound, but for an NC headphone, they're pretty darn good)
Monster Turbine Gold
AKG K181DJ
 
Bottom 5:
MEElectronics M9 (But for $10, they're not that bad)
Beyerdynamic T50P (For $200, they're hilariously bad)
DUNU Crater
Realistic Pro 50 (Too much treble for me now)
Philips The Stretch
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Oh...in-ears. 
Ish - have you tried the T70?  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I haven't. I almost bought them a while ago though. Are they worse?
 
I thought people were overstating the disjointed sound of the T50P, but...there's a gap between the mids and the treble that a boat could pass through with ease. They have more bass than I thought they would have though. I kinda like the T50's treble though. If the T70 has some sort of coherency, I'd be up to try it, but their freq graph looks scary.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Haven't heard T50 - was hoping you could answer if the T70 are better or worse actually haha! The T70 are hilariously awful for $669, and even for ~$375 (which they've hit a few times recently) they're uh...yeah. Basically all treble, papery mids, and that's it.  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
That sounds like the T50, minus the bass. There's more bass than the K181 (small club mode of course). The mids are tragic. I'm thinking about trading them, but I don't want to subject someone else to using them. I'll try modding them over the weekend.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



The T70 are comfortable and isolate "ish" (the QC15 beat them up here (which isn't a surprise), but they're better than something like the M50 by a little bit) - but yeah, extremely top heavy. And it isn't like the SA5000 or SR-325 that are topheavy but still have mids and bass, they're just top heavy and dry as a desert. Very papery sounding. I haven't heard the T5p, but the Tesla drivers really don't inspire much confidence based on the T70 (which were/are not exactly cheap - I mean $700, come on...). If they had decent mids they'd be fantastic (assuming you aren't into a lot of bass - I mean I can honestly forgive them having equal (or less) bass impact than the MDR-F1; that's just my personal preference though); but that's just not in the cards I guess.  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I haven't kept an of my cans, as I've sold or given away all the ones I've owned. 
 
as for my IEM's, I'll have to say with my amp on bass boost, my HiFiMan RE-ZERO's are simply AMAZING, with beautiful warm sound signature and very detailed, and unbeatable in concert with my amp + cowon s9 or my Fuze. When it comes to playing my SONY mp3 player or my Sansa Clip zip, I prefer my UE 700's. Don't need the bass boost to get great bass depth from the 700's with these players. 
 
If i ignored the fit and comfort issues, then my UE TF 10's would kick both these IEM's ass easily.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

An update to my list.
 
1.) Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 Ohm: Very fun and clear sounding headphone. Really detailed with great range. It has a prominent, controlled, and crisp bass, nice midrange that is just a tad distant, and sparkly highs. Sounds great on all genre's. They hate poorly recorded and mastered audio with higher pitched vocals, a very easy EQ tames the fussiness with poorly mastered songs, just tone down the 10kHz spike. Improves greatly on amps and loves tubes. Extremely comfy and don't bother me in long sessions.
 
2.) AKG K240 MKII: A very close second. Quite similar to the DT 990. It's basically a softer and prettier sounding DT 990 with mids presented in a more upfront manner but it's also less detailed and not quite as clear and crisp sounding and has a smaller soundstage. It shares the same general frequency response(including the 10kHz spike) as the DT 990 so it's also not very fond of poorly recorded and mastered audio with higher pitched vocals, the same EQ as the DT 990 will tame their highs on those songs. They also improve greatly amped and love tubes. Also very comfy, pads need some breaking in but I can see them becoming super comfy.
 
3.) AKG K514 MKII: This is by far the brightest headphone I've ever heard but somehow manages to sound right and natural on a lot of things, a little too bass-lean as well. Surprisingly detailed. Imaging and soundstage are okay. If this headphone wasn't so bright, I would of loved it, but the brightness prevents me from truly liking this headphone. These are the most comfortable headphones I own, may not be the most comfortable at first but they simply disappear after you have them on for a while and they weigh less than all my other headphones. Barely improve at all with amplification.
 
4.) BRAINWAVZ HM5: I just don't like the signature of this headphone much at all. The sound is fine until you get to the treble, the treble just dips down and the sound has no life, air, or sparkle to it. It's also not very detailed and the tonality sounds unnatural. Soundstage and imaging are okay. Most uncomfortable headphones I currently own. Excessive clamp that never goes away no matter what you try. Pads get hot after a while. Don't improve much with amplification.

No one should be surprised with this order. The HE-400s are in a league of their own next to the rest of my gear. If I still had the IE8s they would be even with the TF10s and my Shure E4g's (cable broke, I really miss these) would have gone probably under or even with the 558s. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

3. Sennheiser RS-180 - great for portability, I've used it when play rockband, it just rock
4. Sennheiser PX100 - this is my first love with the headphone about 4-5years ago.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Denon AH-D 1000- Recable with D2000
What can't be said about these?  Check just about every known site and these are in their TOP 10 list.
Not the perfect can but they have a pleasing sound that just makes your feet tap...Higher sets have come and gone, these are still here if that tells you something?
 
2) HD 428 with Bass mod- These have been said to beat the famous 580 and even push close to the 600, Both I've never owned, but that's saying a lot coming from a under $50 set.  By far the cleanest low end Senn I've heard, Nice mid to top end detail here.
No darkness (Veil sound) here, Even the 439's are darker...  Got to do the simple bass mode tho, it makes them in another class sound wise. Don't know why Senn didn't just tune them that way from the start..  It's a piece of tape, really.
 
3 & 4 tie)
HD 439 and Koss DJ100
Take the 428 and add more Bass and a slightly darker sound, By no stretch these have a veil, they are really Bright and Crisp just a tad colder sounding then the 428's. Still very detailed..I'm using them now and Camels- The Snow Goose, it's giving me chills..Very pleasing!!
 
Koss- Are you kidding, these are $50, Did they price these wrong?  I've heard mids worse then these on much higher $ sets, These have some of the best (At this price point). The Bass has a nice little punch to it, that never creeps up into the rest of the spectrum. My only gripe is the top rolls off a little to soon, A little Eq here works wonders, Also I found these really need to be matched up correctly with your source.  They will really show flaws in the music..  Well matched these sound fantastic.
 
5) HD 419
The darkest of the newer 400 series, This is the classic Senn Veil, They remind me of the PX100 in some aspects, It has a great sound tho, everything is nicely detailed, just dark.  At 30-40 tho it's hard to beat really.  But you got to have that Senn likable flavor.

I haven't owned many, but I have listened to a lot of headphones before I bought the Q701s. I bought it on sale for 190 with free shipping. No matter how good something sounds, price to performance plays a big role for me. For instance I think the HD800s sound a little bit better than the Q701s, but not by a whole lot, and certainly not enough to justify the price tag. 
 
The only thing I find better AND worth the money above the Q701s are electrostatic headphones.

5) Yuin PK 2
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1-5 are all super close
 
1) AKG K702 - Love the soundstage, love how smooth the mids are, great treble. Enough bass for me
2) AKG K167 - Tighter bass than the denons. Still has the smooth akg mids which I love
3) Denon D2000 - Love the bass and the big sound and resonance that it has
4) Grado SR80i (with L cush and tape mod) - Love how intimiate it is and the wall of sound that you're hit with
5) BMF Spec Fostex T50RP - Very smooth all around, nice extension
6) Sennheiser HD280 Pro - By far the worst. They were good when I first got into headphones but just don't do it now.

I've got the A151, Philips 3580, Monoprice 8323 and 8320, and the Panasonics. I'd say of all of those, the Philips are my favorite for clarity, fun, and comfort. The A151's lack too much bass for me and i'm far from a bass head. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



the UE 700's are excellent for the price. Same with the Philips 3580 for a SOLID and FUN budget IEM, and the HiFiMan RE-ZERO's are simply AMAZING and a beautiful listening experience for great value. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the consensus regarding single BA drivers, is that they lack that bass "punch" that DDs provide. I love the value that the SHE3850 provides; such a capable IEM at such a low price. Right now, I'm on the hunt for those super cheap TDK's haha.

Jeff, If you mean the TDK HA-FX40's, then don't bother. After the Philips, these things will be very disappointing to you. They have recessed mids and sparkly highs that are most definitely fatiguing, even after 50-100 hours of burn in. I rarely use mine. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
You mean JVC FX40's (and I generally agree with your assesment - well, I didn't find the mids to be too recessed, but I could not overcome the brightness). Not sure what Jeff meant by "super cheap TDK's", but if he meant the TDK MT300's, you could do a lot worse (they are pretty darned good for $10-$20).

Nice list, I've said it for yrs, that the Denon 1001, is top of the heap...I'd put the 2000 just over it, but the price difference isn't worth it to me. The 1000/01 are 90% it's bigger brother at under 1/4th the price and going upwards.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
And you can mod them to sound even better than the D2000 with relative ease! I could've done the markL mods on the D2000, but didn't feel comfortable doing so with something that cost over $200 (at the time). Now that they're discontinued they're worth even more...
 
The D1001 really is the best bang-for-the-buck headphone out there.

I've done the MarkL to my CALs and  my D5k and D2k. I kinda want to see if I can eek any more out of the CALs with some custom wooden cups. I just need to find a tonewood stockist and somewhere to turn them.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



That would be cool, Bet it would sound like a baby 5000, as the Cal/1001/1000 FR is the closest to them.  Not that FR's mean much...But that would be interesting to hear!!!

I've thought of doing the same thing, but never got around to making the wooden cups...

Denon actually did this commercially, more or less - it was called the AH-A100. One of the best looking headphones ever made imho - no idea about sonics though (never got them at a nearby dealer to demo, and the price was a bit much for a whim).Edited by obobskivich - 1/16/13 at 12:28pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah, but that was based on the pile of fail D1100. The A100 had it's fans, but mostly it was an overpriced trinket. At the price the forks should've been machined alu or cast magnesium as well.

I'll agree that it should've had more metal for the $500-$600 point indeed - wasn't aware it wasn't D1000 based though. Still, it's a looker.

@ Grumus
The koss portapro are very good bang for Buck headphones. They are extremely portable, I always have one in my school back pack as a backup and they are good for watching a movie in the bus.
But I guess the boses are good for that purpose too. And you're looking for something better. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

@IEMagnet01
The SR60i is what I'd recommend, It very clear, pretty balanced sound sig (a bit trebly, not much bass), although Grados are not known for their comfort. They can be great DIY projects too :P 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Thanks HolyCheese I will look into them. My Bose are falling apart by the minute! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I got mine for ~25 euros so anything near 35 bucks is a good deal.  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
If you wan't looks, comfort, isolation and value when it comes to sound look the Philips Downtown. The Uptowns are pretty good too but costs a little more.
JVC S500 are a very good sounding on-ear but don't have the comfort of a Bose or Downtown.
You should look at the JVC FXD70 however if you are after good sound under 100$ but now we are talking about in-ears. The new Hifiman in-ear may also be a serious bang for buck as is the Sony MH1C.

The Downtowns look very good and philips say they have a natural and clean sound, which I am after. Will have to test them out when my bose finally give up. I have tried and owned a few in-ears (sennheiser CX300, JAYZ three among others) but i never have liked the fit (small ear canals?) . They always seem to fall out when I am on the move so I always tend to take on ears outside. Thanks for the suggestions!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
You won't have any problems with the FXD70 falling out as you where them with a deep fit and I also like to have them around-the-ear which makes them impossible to fall out.
If I use these foam tips I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Only if you have really tiny ear canals can fit be a problem. I have small ear canals myself and can only have the tips in small and the fit is tight but not an issue.
Nothing I have tried be it on-ear or over ear sound as good for the price as these. Extremely clear and engaging sounding with good timbre, balance and imaging. They will make your CX300 and Jays sound very mediocre. Isolation and build is also very good. For 60 bucks they are a steal.

I had the Koss Porta Pros before I gave them to my brother in law as a gift. He'd borrow them every time I'd go visit, and keep them the whole time, listening to classical music. They are very nice value/budget phones, and definitely better than falling apart Bose. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Koss Pro DJ100 / TBSE
 
Sounds better than my HD-650 with the same setup if you ignore the fact that the HD-650 is open (which is a slightly unfair advantage). As much as I love my HD-650, it doesn't really sound technically better in any way. Yeah I know about all those wonderful measurements. What holds the DJ100 driver back is it's enclosure. Koss could do so much more with this one. This one seemed to benefit more from equipment upgrades than my HD-650. About the same as my Q701. This thing is so revealing of every single change in your setup. Feel free to call me nuts if you want! Like the K701, it's easy to hate this with the wrong setup. It's best with very neutral gear to my ears. I want to see an open HD-650 killer from Koss 
 
2. AKG Q701
 
No clue why I put the HD-650 above this last time. This thing got even better when I did some upgrades recently. I think it pretty much couldn't possibly sound any better, but it did. This headphone with my setup is not too forgiving anymore of poor recordings, but yet is still not fatiguing at all ever. It's treble is really smooth.
 
As much as I hate to say it, but the DJ100 sounds often more detailed and clearer. It's sometimes easy to get confused because the DJ100 is warmer/bassier. When my DJ100 sounds less clear than my Q701, it's the fact that the recording is what's not clear! No joke. I didn't realize stuff like this until I tried gaming.with my KRKs and the soundtracks were more muffled on very revealing CLOSED headphones.
 
3. Sennheiser HD-650
 
I love this headphone. It's not boring, but is slightly laid back at times. I didn't think so at first until I compared it to my other headphones. It's nice and full sounding and very well balanced. Mine is even more balanced sounding in the bass than my HD-580 and 600! Makes no sense right? It doesn't seem dark to my ears. It has slightly less treble than my HD-650. No huge mid-bass hump on this pair.
 
Despite sounding very smooth it's almost too forgiving and makes nearly everything sound almost too good.
 
I tend to hate this with warm sounding sources. It was awful when I tried it with the Clip+ to amp (not that I'd use that setup).
 
None of my other headphones have gotten any use in a long time. It's safe to say that these are not going anywhere and will be use for many years.

Just got the HE-500 and I'm listening to them exclusively before I compare them to my 700 head-to-head. I love the 700 for jazz and classical, but the 500s are doing very well, too.  It'll be interesting to see what happens in a couple of weeks when I sit down to compare.
 
i think it would be good to list amps in the context of the headphones as well.  Pairings matter.  Here, I use my Vamp 90% to an appletv/magni 10%.

tdockweiler,
Random thought on the TBSE - you had said the TBSE drivers were 1:1 with Grado drivers, right? So what about dropping a pair in a Jaben AluMod enclosure?  I mean, you'd have a big open enclosure and around-ear pads and all that; should work, right? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
It'd be really expensive just to try. I did this once by destroying a DJ100 and installing it in the open HD-497 shell. It required a pad mod though and it lost most of it's warmth. It ended up sounding like a much clearer HD-598, but with more treble. It wasn't worth the hassle though, but it was portable! I never heard such a small headphone with such a huge soundstage. It was larger than the HD-598, but nothing ever sounded too distant.
 
Too bad the HD-497 is discontinued.
 
If you install it in the XB500 shell it's a bass monster due to those pads. Pretty funny though, but sounded AWFUL. I think a ton of the bass from the XB500 is from the pads! No joke.
 
The DJ100 drivers are nearly the same design as the Grado drivers. The DJ100 driver is too difficult to remove really. Same plastic around the driver etc.

I've been selling a ton of my equipment, and buying several upgrade IEM's! I even sold my Senn cans and used it towards my VSonic GR07's! I also bought the JVC HA-FXT90, and the UE 600's. I've got a bid for the Monster Miles Davis Trumpets, which seem to be the highest rated Monster product? Just above the Coppers. I haven't received any yet except my UE 600's, which sound almost identical to my Sony XBA-1's and are not quite up to par treble wise to my UE 700's.

I think I already posted to this thread a while back but I've picked up some new cans so I guess I'll re-rank them.
 
1. Sennheiser HD600
2. Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro
These 2 are very close and pretty much tied for 1st place. They are both super awesome and put everything else I've owned to shame
 
3. Beyerdynamic DT770 Premium 600 ohm
These were the reason I got the 880s because I absolutely loved them but wanted something very similar sans the bloated bass / recessed mids
 
4. Ultrasone PRO 750
I'm not as happy with these as most Ultrasone users are but I can't deny the awesome punch and texture of the bass on these things
 
5. Beyerdynamic DT 235
Absolutely, hands down, the best budget cans I've ever heard
 
6. AKG K422
I love these little guys. For the $20 I spent on them (Musician's Friend "Deal of the Day") they are superb
 
7. Monoprice 8323 w/ DT250 velour pads
Atrociously uncomfortable in stock form but they are actually quite comfy with DT250 velours. However, they get absolutely no use because of their ridiculously narrow soundstage. Aside from that they are very surprisingly good for the price
 
And the rest of my cans really suck and you should stay very far away from them:
* Sony ZX701iP (ZX700 with the iDevice mic cable) -- These are terrible. I have no idea why people like these. Everything sounds like a 128k mp3 through them
* Denon D310 - Not worth 5 bucks
* Sennheiser HD202 - Not worth 5 bucks
* Sennheiser CX200 earbuds - Meh
* Monoprice 8320 IEMs - Good sound except for a couple frequency ranges that are absolutely atrocious. I was told they were faulty. Got a second pair and they are identical. I was then told it was the tips I was using. Tried a few different tips and they were still they same. Not good at all.

It had more to do with fit than sound. I thought the sound was great. very clear. very balanced. The problem is they never sat well on my head, and the slightest headbanging movement and they flew off. This was unacceptable, especially since i owned the Koss Porta Pros. Any suggestions for balanced cans in the $80-120 range that actually fit snug on the head?

I'd say senn HD 558 but I guess that's out of your budget? Don't know the price. You cold look for a second hand pair.

For $130 yo can have the HD518 which is pretty great.

HD 518 is really great! But it isn't very balanced.
Imo HD 518 = HD 650 and the HD 558 = HD 600 sound wise.

1) Klipsch Image X10
2) V-Moda Crossfade LP2
3) Noontec Zoro
 
Im not saying that I dont like the Zoros, but with my musical preference they are behind the other two. The Zoros are actually wonderful cans, I use them when I walk around town, I can hear all my music loud and clear, yet I can still hear traffic and things like that. 
 
If it wasnt for the fact that I listen to alot of dubstep, and Im a bit of a basshead, the Zoros would be above the LP2s. Honestly I regret buying the LP2s at all, they are just one of those phones that is only good for bassy music. If I could go back to the point that I bought them I probably would have either bought some M-100s or DT770s.
 
As for the X10s, easily the best IEM Ive ever heard, which may or may not be saying much, Ive only heard six IEMs, but one of them was Westone 3, and I personally think the X10s blew them out of the water.

After spending like 5 minutes trying to figure out how the last list and the first list both have 12 items (ostensibly the same things), but the TBSE doesn't appear on the last one, I realized your first list has 13 items and re-starts numbering mid-way through. Still can't figure out what item is missing from the last list.

No love for the TF10 customs? I haven't heard one so don't know whether or not it's an improvement over stock, but something I was considering.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Well in terms of IEM's I'd have to lose my JH13's for them to have the same standing they used to. The reshells will seal better and I guarantee they'll sound better for like 2/3 of the people with TF10's. Theres a reason the Fisher Reshell thread is as large as it is. I consider it almost essential, especially if you've got a worn cable and your TF10 stock shells are starting to show wear. It's a nice way of sending your UE era IEM's off to a "spa" of sorts.

It was tough putting the Atrios and HFI-580s in order because I like them both a lot and on about an equal level. The 5 and 6 spots would go to the broken Sennheiser CX300 and Koss in ear buds that I probably threw away. It was easy positioning the HD 280 Pros because I am not a fan and both of the broken ear buds were much more enjoyable when they worked. I lent the 280s to a friend and I'm not even sure that I got them back. If someone can get some enjoyment out of them, I'm fine with that.

I should probably update my gear list and just get rid of the busted and lost pairs.

The hd518 comes VERY close to my personal preference, there is almost no other headphone that makes me truly enjoy music like the hd518's do. That said, the hd518 covers all the frequencies and the ms-one misses alot of bass. ms-one unmodded has way too harsh and fatiguing treble. The hd518 is also more detailed so yea the hd518's are better. They are seriously underrated cans imo.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Best on left, going down to the right. Simplified collection in one picture.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My Lists:
 
1. Sennheiser HD650 - The Gold standard for me. Other headphones may be better, but these are the standard by which I will judge all other headphones. I am sure running them off an Oppo 105 is not optimal, but when I do, these things are absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!! Unfortunately, because they are hard to drive AND open back, my use of them are limited
2. Sennheiser Momentum - My newest cans, already have impressed me tremendously and I have yet to use them as they are intended: every day portables for school/work.
3. Sennheiser PX360 - The work horse of the bunch. These have been used practically each and every single day for the last year. They are great headphones, well worth thier price when mated to a modest portable amp. People complain about how skinny the cable is, but like I said, Ive used these nearly every single day, in every situation: studying, walking, working out at the gym, working, they get thrown into my back pack, they go with me when I travel, etc etc etc. Never once had an issue with their durability.
4. Bose On Ears - Yes, I am aware of the scorn Bose products elicit round these parts of town, and sure enough, I now KNOW what you all are talking about. However, these headphones were responsible for me to get into Head (and Hi)-fi. They were a major step up from the crap i had before and made me want MORE.
5. Bose In Ears - See above
 
I should be receiving my HD429s soon, they will be used for the gym, playing sports purposes. Now that the Momentums will pick up the PX360s duties, the PX360s are going to be handed down to my wife; however, I still love my PX360s and told my wife she cannot take these to the gym, so I will be buying her a pair of Sennheiser HD201s.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My top headphones in no particular order: HE500, HD650, ER4S
 
My second best headphones - worse than the aforementioned ones, but still very, very nice. Again, in no particular order: Audeo PFE 012 with grey filters, ER4P, DT990 Pro, FXT90.
 
I don't really care much about the other ones listed in my signature, although HD555 is quite decent and RE0 used to be one of the favorites of mine until the quality control on them went downhill.
 
I can't really rank my headphones any further than that for now as each has its strengths and weaknesses.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Ranked by best sound quality 
 
1. HE-6 - Grand sound stage, and weighty clean sound with great resolution in the highs, and fast bass. Handles fast and complex music with ease. Impressive, and engaging sound with most recordings. It's a bit bright in the tonal balance, and could use more bass, and better definition/relief in the imaging (perhaps partly caused by the bright tuning). They can be fatiguing, I usually don't use them for very long at a time. Very heavy, but somewhat comfortable, but the clamp is a bit strong even with the headband bend out. Nice soft velour pads (currently got the old stock velours on). Ore thing that would really suit this headphone is angled drivers, to make it sound like the sound is coming in front of you. If I was Hifiman, that would be my main priority for a new headphone. No idea if it's possible though.
 
2. HD650 - The classic do-it-all can. Perfect fit, but a little heavier than the ones below, can wear them for hours, they're not fatiguing at all, almost perfect tonal balance with forward mids, great attack - acoustic instruments sounds great. Nice open sound., but a little lacking in clarity, could use more bass too. I've used these for 6+ years, always been satisfied with them.
 
3. Creative Aurvana Live - Sweet smooth sound, nice boomy low end, good tonal balance, easy to listen to, good clarity and punch. Maybe because it's a closed headphone, the sound is a little small and closed in, but they isolate well which is really nice. Almost as comfortable as the HD650, it's very light, but it pushes a little on the ears. This is my newest headphone, and I'm using this most of the time both as a portable, and at home. Nice soft pleather pads. Liking this headphone a lot.
 
4. Panasonic HTF600 - Slightly bigger, and more open sound than the CAL, nice dark tonal balance, I think maybe vocals sound better on this than on the CAL because of this. Good bass. But overall it doesn't sound as good as the CAL, I think. Pretty comfortable, but they clamp a little. Using the stock pads pleather pads, which are not very good. I used to use these with my phone, and also at home sometimes, but I think the CAL has replaced them.
 
5. Superlux HD681 - Good punchy sound, good fast bass, but a little too edgy in the highs. Light in weight. bad vinyl stock pads, it's better with velour pads. Not using these anymore.
 
 


 
Nice collection, that's pretty much the headphones I'm most curious to hear. I agree with the bolded part. I'm toying with the idea to swap my HE-6 for an HD800 , just need to demo it somehow.

It would have been more funny, if you actually owned / tried them. But yeah, that's a bit that.
I  understood that, when I saw so many people  discussing which cable with exotic names and expensive prices,
would be best for the hd800 on the original appreciation thread  (closed thread, but replaced by a new one).

I don't have as much experience with headphones as most of you guys on here but from the ones I've owned/own I would have to say:
 
1. Sennheiser HD600  (Just sooo good with every genre)
2. Beyerdynamic DT990 600ohm

4. Alessandro MS-1
5. Grado SR60 (My first real pair of headphones that made me want "more")
6. Sennheiser PX100
 
Also thinking of owning the HE500 but they are quite costly for me and I am not sure if they would be worth it, I have to think a little more on those

i just sold my VSonic GR07. I didn't get the same WOW from the sound that many have talked about. I felt it was one of the biggest wastes of $150.00. Sold them and almost broke even, which was nice. Money went towards purchasing my new UE 900. I think I get as good a sound if not better from my amped RE-ZERO. IMHO.

1. Koss Pro DJ100 / TBSE (modded Pearstone Velour pads)
 
With these pads and my setup (transparent), it's as close to MY HD-650 as i'll get it in a closed headphone. A little more energetic and clearer though. Both have similar amounts of bass and it's very well controlled. DJ100 has more treble and is more revealing and less forgiving. With (modded) Pearstone pads it's so smooth sounding. No forward anything really. NOTE: without a good desktop amp/dac it'll never be this high. No way.
 
2. AKG Q701
 
I've had this since Oct 2011 and I wouldn't change a thing. I don't need more warmth or more bass. Non-angled pads would be nice without degrading the sound! I guarantee you i'll be listening to these five years from now unless I go broke.
 
3. HD-650
 
Love it. This one is way better than the last two pairs I had with a muffled sound and too much mid-bass. I listen to this when I don't want to be bombarded with harsh/garbage tracks. My Q701 isn't as forgiving.
 
4. K400
 
Got this in on a trade and the first day it was REALLY trebly. Turns out my new surge protector I thought wasn't screwing up my amp actually still WAS in some way. Now it has smooth treble and decent enough bass.
 
Totally addicting mids (not too forward), crystal clear sound and a huge soundstage. Not so much that it makes anything sound too distant. The mids on this are almost as good as those of the DJ100. They sound slightly more engaging than those of the Q701.
 
If you love acoustic music with a huge soundstage, you NEED this. Also great for Jpop with female vocals. Bassheads avoid at all costs! Seems like a slightly more energetic/aggressive K501. I think the K400 has more treble perhaps?
 
One of the first headphones that WOWs me with acoustic music AND it's soundstage.
 
BTW this was AWFUL on the HRT MSII for whatever reason. Same amp..
 
Also..it doesn't sound as warm as the Q701 or K601..but I don't mind.

In what ways did you have to mod the Pearstone velours to get them on the DJ100/TBSE? I think its about time I finally get these Koss' you keep goin on about. :D I very much prefer velour to leather/pleather so that sounds enticing as well. Are there any other velour pads that fit that you've tried?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I made them closer to how the M50 pads sound. Inside the edges of the pads I cut four tiny "vent" holes. On the top, bottom, left and right. About the size of an eraser head. The M50 pads have only two holes. Without the holes in the velour pads they are too warm sounding and bassy with the DJ100. Slightly bloated mid-bass. Some may like it though. Took me a year to figure this out. I think the M50 pads sound so good with the DJ100 because of these vents, a good seal and the foam backing.
 
I have SRH-940 velour pads to try today. I hope they work!

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I originally ranked my headphones like this, with cost, amp needs, etc, not being a factor. They were ranked PURELY on SQ alone:
 
1. Sennheiser HD650
2. Sennheiser Momentum
3, Sennheiser PX360
4. Sennheiser HD429*
5. Bose On Ear
6. Bose In Ear
 
*The HD429 were previously unranked, as I just BARELY got em last week.  I ranked em after a proper break in and some good long listening sessions.
 
Another ranking would involve PRICE. What I consider "price" is not just the cost of the can, but the cost of the equipment needed to actually get something descent out of your headphones. So with that idea, with price involved, here's how I rank em:
 
1. Sennheiser HD650 - If you can get them for the price I got the for ($367 total, including shipping), then these rightfully belong at #1 even if price is considered. To really get these to sing you need at the very least a descent source and a descent desktop amp. By descent, I mean a mid-fi CD/SACD/DVDA audio player, a good soundcard for your computer, or a mid-fi DAC. As far as descent desktop amp, a FiiO E9 has more than enough power to drive them. For a while I mainly hearing them through the FiiO E7 DAC docked to the E9, and although they sounded great, I always felt they weren't really being used right. I truly fell in love with my HD650s after hearing them through my Yamaha DVD-S2500 player and E9 amp. But the HD650s do get better and better as your equipment gets better, the HD650s will rarely be the bottleneck in your system. Right now, they are used on either my computer through an Emu 1212m card to a Yamaha 5950 amp, and out to the E9, and they sound awesome. But when I plug them in directly into my Oppo BDP-105 and play SACDs or CDs, wow....I mean WOW. The Oppo not only has high end DACs, but also a high quality, head phone amp built in, and plugging the HD650s into this player was a major leap in SQ over any other set up I've plugged them into. True to the word: HD650s scale up scary good!
 
2. Sennheiser HD429 - Of all my Sennheisers, these are weakest overall cans by SQ (as evidenced by the 'price is no object' ranking. However, they require nothing else but a descent source. I hooked them up to my J3 and they sound great unamped. If you do have some amps or some nicer stuff, these will scale up well enough. Hearing them through the Emu 1212m to 5950 to E9, I rocked for 3 hours long, without thinking of switching up headphones; but again, they deserve the #2 spot because the dont REQUIRE better equipment, and still sound great. You spend $50 on these and that's all you will need to spend on; you get great sounding cans, period.
 
3. Sennheiser PX360 - I got these headphones from about $120 over a year ago, and they really do sound great. However, you get almost NO volume from a J3 if  you dont get at the very least a  portable headphone amp. I use a FiiO E7 with these, but a cheaper E11 will probably work fine (from what I understand, is that the E11 might be the better amp, but the E7 cost more because it is also a DAC). Once amped, these sound really good, and while they don'r reach the level of the Momentums or HD650s, they are still a worthwhile headphone.
 
4. Sennheiser Momentum - You WILL pay $350 for these new (at least the black ones). Although they sound good off a DAP unamped, they do not sound like $350 cans without an amp. Again, once you get an amp like an E7, you will be set. I usually listen to these through and E7 and Cowon J3 and they are CLEARLY better headphones than the PX360s, however, they also cost at least $200 more, and they are NOT $200 better sounding. I wrote up a review comparing the PX360s to the Momentums and said they were worth the upgrade, however thats taking into consideration the "law of diminishing returns": the idea that to move up in quality in audio gear, you have to pay more than what you get in return, in other words, if you want something twice as good, you will be paying much more than twice as much for it. But this list is not about that, its about pure SQ vs Price, so with the "law" thrown out the window, the Momentums rank lower than the PX360s. Dont get it twisted though, I bought the Momentums as an upgrade to the PX360s and I don't plan on returning them, they are here to stay!
 
5. and 6. Bose cans. The good thing is that these will play very loud with no amplification at all, however, now that I've been exposed to more natural sounding headphones, the super piercing, unnatural highs of the Bose headphones kill their value as $80-$100 headphones. The HD429s are better headphones, regardless of price, but considering that they cost $30-$50 LESS than the Bose, it really knocks the value of the Bose cans severely.

2. Denon AH D2000 - for home usage
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I don't think they are a "WOW" sounding IEM either, they are neutral with no peak in the treble which is why they remind me so much of the HD600 but with a much smaller soundstage and less detail. I paid £100 for them and they were worth the money for me...although they do hurt my ears after a while.

After spending a few months with my headphones and getting rid of a few pairs I don't like. My order of preference has changed, especially my number one headphone.
 
1.) AKG K240 MKII: After owning these headphones for about 3 months, they are clearly my favorite headphones. Their rich, seductive, detailed and smooth midrange has won me over in the test of time. They add this groove and are very musical to my ears. They ended up being hard for me to take them off my ears and end up getting the most head time, they have the least amount of bass of my headphones, I consider them quite neutral in bass with a slight boost in midbass, but still within neutral range. They are very good with male vocals and are good with female vocals. They improve drastically with an amp and I don't think they should be considered if you don't have an amp.
 
2.) Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro: These headphones are bright and bassy but in a non-fatiguing way as the entire sound from bottom to top is quite smooth. The bass is punchier and extends deeper than the K240s, but doesn't have that groove the K240s bass has. It's very clean and a bit analytical sounding, they need to have a tube amp in my opinion otherwise they sound a bit unnatural and too recessed in the midrange. Midrange is transparent and smooth, this headphone is amazing with female vocals, but it falls short on male vocals when compared the K240 and as a whole I say it's a little worse in vocals than the K240. The timbre of the sound isn't as good, it's slightly unnatural sounding. Technically it's the best headphone I own, but it's simply not as fun and organic sounding as the K240 and thus is a bit lower on the list as it ends up getting less head time as well. This is the second bassiest headphone I own.
 
3.) Sennheiser PX-100 ii: These headphones are clearly dark sounding, but they are also very good portable headphones. The treble is there and is good quality but sometimes it is painfully dark. I really enjoy these headphones. They sound pretty warm and fairly natural, easily powered and don't need an amp. These are my bassiest headphones, the amount of midbass they produce compare to my other headphones is insane. To my ears, many Senns have been unusually bassy compared the other brands such as AKG and Beyerdynamic.

Need to change mine a bit now. My all time favourite this week has been my HD600's. Subjective to change next week though.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Update to my list:
 
Sennheiser HD600
 
The only thing I listen to anymore, very smooth and natural sounding.  The only complaint I could level with it is one I'm sure a lot of people would be surprised by; I don't think its quite "thick" enough.  It needs a hair less upper mids and a bit more lower mids, and then its tonal balance sounds perfect to me.  It can sound thin on some material,  but never sounds overtly thick on anything, and I like a thickness to the sound where it's called for in the source material.  The EQing I tried mostly solved this, but I'll be getting a Rolls Bellari HA540 and rolling a few NOS tubes in it soon enough; a tube amp with the right tubes should provide what I'm looking for.  I'm not concerned with audiophile reproduction anymore, all I care about is how enjoyable the headphone is, and to me that means natural and completely transparent, with insane levels of clarity, and something I have absolutely no complaints about, but still has sublime detail, a proper stage, and precise imaging, mostly.  Looking to the Koss ESP-950 as my TOTL headphone after this one.
 
Everything Else
 
Meh, they all have distracting problems that don't let me listen to the music, and instead force me to listen to the flaws because they're so front-and-center.  Mostly bad tonal balances.  DT1350 in particular has a few layers of haze over it that I can tolerate if need be, caused by a forward upper midrange and some other things, but I'd prefer to be using the HD600.

Short list, but these are my top 3
 
1. AKG Q701 (with a 2db bass boost)
2. Modded Fostex T50rp
3. Vsonic GR01
 
I have a few other cheap headphones/in ears that I haven't used in months, so I won't bother listing them...
 
The Q701 with a slight 2db bass boost is the best headphone I've ever heard and makes me completely happy. I feel no need to own any other open headphones. The GR01 and T50rp are my portable and the latter being my portable with an amp outside the house headphones. The T50rp is good enough to use at home as well, but I just still prefer the sound of the Q701. The GR01 was a game changer for me. When I got them, they were the most accurate thing I'd heard, which eventually left me looking for a full size open copy of them. Which brought me to the Q701.

In terms of head time:
1.) AKG K240 MKII(warm and engaging with just the right amount of treble for my ears)
2.) Sennheiser PX-100 ii(can be too dark and bassy at times, a little too smooth in the upper midrange and treble, can be surprisingly fun and musical at times)
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro(not very engaging, a little bright but not enough to bother me, needs a tube amp to be engaging and fill out midrange, would be ranked #2 on a tube amp)
 
Headphones too new to determine their place:
Sansui SS-2(vintage late 60s to late 70s, amazing midrange, but lacks some definition)

My modest collection:
 
Sennheiser HD439 - Good all around performance.
Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80 - Excellent bass impact and extension but slightly fatiguing highs.
SoundMagic E10 - Fun sounding though slightly veiled and warm.
Monoprice 8320 - Extraordinary value (so much so that I've bought three more pairs after my first), great clarity and nice vocals but lacking in bass presence.
Koss PortaPro - I'm not sure what it is but I really don't enjoy these headphones, I can't put my finger on it but I just don't like listening with them.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Grado RS1i: Bright, aggressive, fun without being too harsh. I love these for anything with electronic guitars to classic music. The L-cushions are a bit painful after a few hours though.
2) Beyerdynamic DT990: Bright, has a bit more bass. Pretty good complement for the Grados. I use these for bassier music / games / movies. Super-comfortable.
3) Focal Spirit One: Darker but wouldn't call it warm. Clear. VERY fast bass. My #1 choice for portable use. Bassy but not overwhelmingly so, sensitive, a bit difficult to drive with a desktop amp. Very comfortable, but the headband tends to creak a little bit now and then.
4) Ultimate Ears UE700 (Newer version, IEM): Clear, insanely good all-rounders. Bright. Downsides are kinda annoyingly prominent microphonics plus the comply tips hurting my ears after a while.
5) Sennheiser HD555: Haven't used these for a while, but they were my #1s before I got the Grados. Easy to drive and good SQ. A bit bland-sounding.
6) Shure SE215CL (IEM): Bassiest of all the stuff that I have. Fun for electronic music and maybe some classical stuff, but I really dislike its sound for guitars (both electric and acoustic). Kinda artificial sound. More comfortable and less microphonics than on UE700 though.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I would say it the other way around. The PS1000 has a rather large mid-bass hump and doesn't go anywhere as low as the HP1000s. Technically the HP1000s measure (and sound to my ears) better across the board. The PS1000s do throw a more expansive sound stage though. But we all have our tastes.

Sennheiser HD-598 (this is a fun headphone to listen to. I recabled mine with Mogami W2893 and felt it was worth the trouble)
Sennheiser HD-580 (sounds slightly more energetic than the HD-600. Due to grills)
AKG K702 65th Anniversary (have the Q701 + Annie pads, supposedly sounds the same. Feel a bit weird/guilty for even listing this. Oh well.)
Sennheiser HD-600 (this has annoyed me more than any other headphone)
 
K400 is new and don't really know where I'd add it in there. With stock pads maybe below the Annie. I like it a lot with Annie or Q701 pads.
 
I still have both KRKs but I destroyed them I think. I almost never use them.
 
BTW I've now owned the Q701 since late 2011! The DJ100 has been used the most out of any headphone and since 2010 maybe. I've probably destroyed at least 7 pairs with my worthless mods.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I disagree about the PS1000 not going as low as the HP1000, for me, it's the other way around.
That being said, even though i do prefer the PS1000 to the HP1000, it's not a night and day difference, but just enough for me to give the PS1000 the edge.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
The differences wasn't huge, but the depth was still deeper on the HP1000s to my ears. 
 
The top one is the HP1000 and the bottom one is the GS1000 (measure very similarly as the PS1000s).
 
 

The very natural treble of the HP1000s was also quite good. Joe Grado really had an ear. 
 
FWIW, GS1000 vs. PS1000:

Very close measuring and sounding, but I do slightly prefer the PS1000s, but the GS1000s are sure light and easy on the head WRT comfort.

I find the srh-940's to be a scaled down version of the 800's they have similar tone but the 800's extend lower and the bass has a tad more weight, they also have a wider soundstage though higher is about the same. With the 940's I fund they have great detail retrieval and they sound very open for closed headphones, I mainly use them as my portable phones, when at home I still go to the 800's though, same detail retrieval and dynamics but the bass extention, weight and the soundstage are just that step above. Plus the 800's are the comfiest headphones I own 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yep, the HP-1000s are pretty amazing and definitely reference and more accurate, but I can understand someone preferring a more colored sound.
I think both complement each other well since they sound so difference and were designed with different goals in mind.
Regarding the 800 vs srh940:
I'd agree completely. The 800 is slightly better all around when well amped ($$), but considering the massive price different and how close the Shure gets. I consider it a pretty amazing value regarding SQ. The 800 has a sort of artificial sound to me that the Shures don't have either.
However, the headband on the Shures is incredibly ugly and they have a history of the cheap plastic cracking.Edited by robm321 - 4/21/13 at 4:55pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Thanks. I'm surprised regarding the bass, because I  think the srh940 has more sub bass (although I've done a mod).
Also I  think the treble of srh940 has a different "flavor". Doesn't it sound "sharper" ? ( I  guess some other people would use more negative adjective, such like harsh, or hardness). Regarding comfort, my  cheaper hd595 are more lightweight , so you feel them less on the head.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'd  be curious of  how people could describe what they find artificial on the hd800.
I  think the big stereo separation, which is more a feature than a flaw, might disturb some.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'd say if anything it would be the soundstage width, it's the widest of all the headphones I've tried. The stereo seperation isn't too different from any other open headphone far less seperation than closed headphones.
As for sub bass on the 940's I can't really comment, I do most of my listening with them on the train whilst I use the 800's at home. The 940's do make the highs more aparent than the 800's but its harsh in comparison, it makes female ballads a tad too bright. Though the 940's are great for the price plus they're super easy to run, give them a fiio e06 and they'll sing. Whilst the 800's only sound there best with good amplification and synergy. I run mine off a WA5 and you can tell which tubes they like it dislike.
I should also add the 940's sound, to me, as though they have a tall soundstage compared to its width, due to its extension and slightly boosted highs the notes just seem to float upwards.Edited by Fririce0003 - 4/21/13 at 6:20am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

For me, the "artificial" sound with regards to the 800 might have something to do with the soundstage, but also it's timbre. For example, LCD-2, HD650/600 sounds more natural to me. The 800 is very detailed and well done but has a reproduced quality to it that's hard to explain.
I'm not trying to rain in anyone's parade. If the 800s sound natural to you, enjoy them. They are very nice headphones, but that's what kept me from ultimately getting them.

Not trying to be a smart *****, but i don't care too much for graphs, i believe that it's the sum of the whole system that counts, if you have a brighter sounding source, a neutral amp and headphones with a rolled off treble, the en result might sound very good, even tough two of it's components don't have the flattest frequency responce. And even if the whole system ends up being far from flat, it's still might sound good to some people. Also if they told the whole story, most Grado headphones would be unlistenable, but i admit that i'm surprised that, on paper at least, the HP1000 do seem to have more bass than either the GS and PS1000.
 
 
It's not hard for me to understand that you, and many others i'm sure, prefer the sound of the HP1000 over that of the PS1000, the HP1000 are wonderful sounding headphones. And like i said, it's not a night and day difference, and to tell you the truth, i consider myself very lucky to have the liberty to chose between these fine sounding headphones for my listening sessions, it's a nice ''problem'' to have. Even my SR80i bring a smile to my face everytime i put them on, my GS1000 are the ones that get the less headtime.
 
There's nothing i like more than to reading positive comments where people have found the ''perfect'' headphones for them, i have, and mine are the PS1000, by a hair

Been a while, and I've gotten more headphones and modded a few.
 
1: Sony DR-Z5: An old beast from the late 1970's/early 80's. Designed for portable CD players, which were just developed at the time, and is thus very easy to drive.  Two words: Holy crap. Extremely detailed and fast. Their decay is instantaneous; better than the DT1350's even, and their attack is comparable to that of a high-end Grado. Neutral and flat, with very deep bass extension. Very slightly lacking in impact, more stat-like. Excellent imaging, relatively deep soundstage but very little width. Treble is amazing, cymbals are there and gone almost instantaneously with no splash or distortion. Absolutely no sound leakage and great isolation. Somewhat finicky fit, but very comfortable. Built like a tank and looks quite handsome. Possibly the best portable headphone in existence. Absolutely unbelievable.
 
2: KOSS Pro/4AAAA "Quad-A": This is the name I have given my modded 4AAA. They have been completely rewired with OFC, have dual-sided detachable cables and have been converted to a vented open-back design. Very warm and lush with a very smooth frequency response.  Euphonic and impactful. Well-detailed and controlled sound. Very wide and deep soundstage with great imaging. Speaker-like bass, very tactile. Absolutely perfect isolation but lots of sound leakage due to the open back. Decent comfort, but pads are old and hard. Will be replaced soon. Very heavy; huge and tank-like. Difficult to drive so usage is typically reserved for home use. Excels with trance, EBM, hardstyle, etc. Sees a lot of use.
 
3: Beyerdynamic DT1350: Somewhat neutral. Very tightly controlled, lots of detail. Very good low end. Somewhat hazy midrange; artificial sounding treble. Warm and euphonic out of sub-par equipment but neutral and ruthlessly revealing when used with a better source. Very DAC-dependent. Excellent decay, decent attack. Somewhat diffuse imaging, very small soundstage. Amazing isolation and build quality. Very comfortable and stable. Light yet tank-like design, almost entirely made of nextel-coated aluminum. 
 
4: Pioneer SE-700: Extremely neutral and flat with somewhat rolled off bass and upper treble. Excellent imaging but absolutely no soundstage. Somewhat thin with moderate attack and decay. Becomes fuller and faster out of more powerful amplifiers. Build is good, with lots of aluminum integrated into the design. One of the most gorgeous headphones ever made. Fit is somewhat loose and finicky, and the thin pads are bad for comfort. Since it was designed for speaker taps, this headphone is harder to drive than the HiFiMAN HE-6. The piezoelectric principle makes it unbelievably insensitive and its impedance is infinite. Aren't used very much due to this. 
 
5: Pioneer SE-500: Similar to the SE-700 but even less bass due to the thinner diaphragm. Bright. More detailed and significantly easier to power than the SE-700 (though the SE-700 might be better with proper equipment). Even though they're bass-less, they are very exciting to listen to. Not quite as flat as the SE-700. Excellent imaging, decent soundstage. Much more snug fit-wise than the SE-700 and more comfortable too. They're different, but they still see some use.
 
6: KOSS K/6x Plus "Digital Ready": These headphones are pretty bad. These were my first headphones. I got them from a garage sale when I was somewhere around 12. They are very bassy, and have good treble and decent mids. Good imaging, but lacking soundstage. The deal breaker on this is the infamous "tin-can" veiling so common in headphones from the 80's. They also do not seal properly on the head due to the fixed yoke design, and thus aren't very comfortable either. However, KOSS's build quality is wonderful. Extremely sturdy plastic, aluminum struts, metal baffle. Very light. 
 
7: AKG K240 Studio: I do not like these headphones. They are moderately detailed with an incredibly warm and airy signature, and beautiful treble. However... they have absolutely no control of the diaphragm. The attack and decay are so slow that it is possible to physically see the driver moving, which is extremely bad. They have a small soundstage and decent imaging. Somewhat passive and lacking in impact. Extremely comfortable and light, built like a tank, and has a nice detachable cable. I really want to like this headphone but I just don't.
 
8: Audio-Technica ATH-M50: Had these for almost 3 years now, and I've grown tired of them. Their low end doesn't have good extension and the highs are shrill and piercing. The lower mids simply aren't there, giving it a very hollow, thin sound. Not very fast in either attack or decay, and not very detailed because of it. No soundstage, poor imaging. Comfort is decent, fit is very loose. Basically just an all-around "meh". Extremely overrated; not recommended as anything but a first headphone, and be prepared to sell it because you're gonna want something better after a while. I'm keeping mine because it was a gift.
 
9: Sony MDR-SA3000: I'm sorry, but these headphones are terrible. They try to fake being fast by being trebley and dry, when in fact they lag behind headphones like the DR-Z5 and my friend's RS2i quite considerably. The entire sound is crammed up into the high registers. They lack any form of body or impact; very thin and uninvolving. There are no lower mids or bass, it's basically like listening to a 2-way headphone that only has the tweeter. Not a particularly good tweeter either. Their presentation sounds very closed-in, everything comes from a single spot in front of you with very little width and depth. Put simply, they don't do anything right. Can't believe these headphones are rated so highly.
 
Cheers!

Greetings. I would first like to say that I am new to the boards and looking forward to combing the threads for good info on all types and brands of headphones. Anyway,my rankings are:
1. Hifiman HE-300

q460 over k551? tell us why 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Beyerdynamic DT880 premium 250 ohm- Hard for me to find much not to love about these. So comfy, nice detail, closest to neutral and most realistic sounding of all my cans. They also sound really nice with the tubes on my Maverick A1 amp. I can put these on and just get lost in the music for hours. They play really well with my preferred genres- Jazz, indie, vocals,classical, but also give me enough bass and are  engaging enough when I want to listen to some dubstep, hiphop, punk etc. Plus they respond well to EQ if i want more bass.
2. Shure SRH940- really enjoy the mids and the detail on these, heavy bass impact isn't big on my priority list, so not a problem for me. I actually enjoy the tight and accurate bass on these, plus bass extends really well. Can be a little uncomfortable and don't sound as realistic to me as my Beyers, so I will rarely reach for these over my Beyers unless I need the isolation. Also had to fix a couple cracks recently with some Gorilla Glue, but are holding up fine now.  (Glad I bought these used for a good price.)
 
3. Etymotic hf3- I am not big into IEMs, but when I need isolation and don't want to haul around 940's I enjoy them, I love the amount of detail on these for the price ($65 cowboom sale a while ago)
 
4. Pannesonic RP-HTF600- my beat up cans or if I just want a little bass in my face. Don't get much use these days.
 
5. Jaybird SB2 Bluetooth- not great SQ for price but made the list of my headphones I use b/c they are convenient for running or doing yard work.
 
Have one other full size and IEM, but they don't make my list b/c they are sitting in the closet collecting dust.

1: Heir 8.A
2. LCD-2.2
3. W1000x
4. HD558
5. GR02
 
The LCD-2.2 re starting to lose a bit of favour, i find the shelved treble a little too relaxing, the 8.A just brings music to life a little better. Also the W1000x are seriously amazing, probably the only the only set of cans I own that could be "bright", and I'm finding myself enjoying the treble quality :) Still all my cans/IEMs are all mostly warm in sound sig, might be getting a more neutral pair soon....
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I agree that the W1000X is pretty astonishing. I consider it top-of-its-class for dynamics, though I'd love to compare it against the HE-400.
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

It's a bit hard, really depending on the music type or movies. But anyway, I'll take my shot.
1. hd800, best for classical, well recorded jazz and movies.
2. ad2000, best for vocal and high speed bass.
3. lcd 2.1, good overall
3. hd650, very nice vocal warmth, mushy soumd but micro detail is very good, if you notice.
4. sony sa3000, very detail mid, vocal a little bit far.
5. ad700, wide, open soundstage, with a little vocal warmth, really love it, punchy bass too.
5.2 t50rp, very detail vocal for movie, but the bass is not really hard hitting.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


There is no way that a JH13 is second to a T50RP, modded or otherwise. You can't fix poor transient response and bad decay. You also can't fix high THD.
 
It's possible to achieve a good tonal balance with damping but fixing slow attack and decay is not possible without heavily modifying the driver itself.
Edited by takato14 - 5/7/13 at 2:48pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
'Fixing' the transient response is very easy with DSP.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



This isn't an objective thread, though. I prefer the JH13s to the HD 800, T1, LCD-2 myself (haven't ranked in the latter trio as I don't own them), and that's purely a subjective preference.
 
There are some headphones that measure like poop (e.g. vintage sextetts, ATH woodies) and aren't technically superlative by any measure that I'm sure many would place near or at the top of their lists.
 
I'm sure people's opinions go all over the place.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
AKG of the Sextett vintage measure quite well apart from a couple treble spikes.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I don't count DSP effects as "fixing" the driver, because the hardware itself is still flawed.
 
Nonetheless it's quite impressive what can be achieved with convolution.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Call it fixing the sound, then. Either way you get better transients.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Is this your list?  i see you dont even own the jh13's....
 
you can't fix trolls either by arguing with them either
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'm not trolling. I'm questioning your credibility, since you seem to think that a $70 orthodynamic can be better than a multi-way, balanced armature, $1100 CIEM.
 
I have heard the T50RP, modded and stock, and was significantly unimpressed.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


whats your credibility?  you dont even own the jh13's...so how can you even have an opinion on them?   I question your credibility if you base preference of gear based on price.  
 
So you were unimpressed.... what does that have to do with MY list?  I think MH1's were garbage but there are people who love them.  It doesn't make me right and them wrong or vice versa.

Have you heard the Maddog or Paradox? Whether you were "impressed" or not really doesn't change the fact that these headphones compete with headphones costing upwards of $1k.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Bull. The stock HD600 is superior to a modded T50RP.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Have you heard a modified T50RP by a reputable modder?
 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Have you actually heard either of the hp's that I mention? Maybe you have, I don't know. 
 
I like the hd6xx a lot. It's certainly able to outclass a modded t50rp that you'd make, but not the MD or Paradox. Of course this is just one man's opinion. I'm entitled to mine as you are to yours. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'm really getting sick of that argument.
 
No, I haven't heard one. And I dont need to. Mods can only affect tonal balance and possibly presentation (ie soundstage). The drivers will still have the same poor transient response and high THD, regardless of how euphonic it may sound.
 
You can be the best artist in the world but if you're restricted to a program like MS-Paint there's only so much you can do to make your picture look good.
 
I understand getting attached to your handiwork, but be realistic.

how do i attract trolls where ever i go?  who cares?  you dont own the jh13's.... so im pretty sure you've never heard it.  so all arguements you have about it are null and void.  
 
artists aren't restricted by their tools.  Art isnt defined with what you begin with its what you end with.  SMH; people who think they know what art is.
 
This is what happens when people try too hard to mix tech and art together..... a complete piece of crap.

I'm not sure why you're so fervently against something you've never heard. It's pretty basic head-fi etiquette to not give judgement on pieces of equipment you don't have experience with. 
 
Lol! This is a little humorous. Not my handiwork. It's a little difficult to understand and wrap your brain around, especially in the audio world. $300 headphones beat $100, right? I used to think like you do. 
 
When it comes down to it the T50RP drivers themselves are actually really good. That's why so many people hopped onto modding them. They have less distortion than the HD600 to start with, AND have a much much faster response because they use orthodynamic drivers. The modders saw this and started retuning them. 
 
How much do you think those HD600s are worth? Are they worth $300? Are they worth that because of the material involved, or because Sennheiser is forcing merchants to sell at that price? The materials involved in the HD600 are pretty cheap. Plastics, metals, copper, and some synthetic plastics for the driver. Not a lot of money involved there. Sennheiser took their HD580 driver and made the HD600 by retuning the driver. The HD600's driver has kind of maxed out the performance. 
 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 he doesnt even own the hd600.  smh
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I am not a troll, and obviously you care if you keep pressing the issue. My arguments are not null and void because the T50RP is a piece of ****.
 
Artists ARE restricted by their tools. You don't know jack **** about art if you think that. Try giving a painter a piece of charcoal and bristol board, they won't be able to produce anything near the same quality as their paintings. The amount of time it takes to blend colors in MSPaint is incredulous, you'll have color banding even if you take hours to color a small area. It also lacks any sort of brush dynamics, layering, or post-processing. Hell, transparency barely even works. I'm not saying good results are impossible, I'm saying that the trouble needed to get anything near something from Photoshop (sort of like replacing the driver magnets perhaps?) is almost completely pointless.
 
What in the hell are you talking about with that last statement?
 
And, don't be stupid, my friend lent me his HD600 for a couple weeks.

1. They are ok, nothing special, not really good. You can get a 120ohm SFI tweeter driver and specifically dampen them to sound better than most modded T50RP.
2. People jumped on them due to the hype. Apart from the Paradox and MrSpeakers and few others carefully modded most of the user modded T50RP are quite bad.
3. Wrong, nothing was retuned, same driver with only a difference of clear vs yellow membrane used and different outter filters for the housing chamber that secures the drivers.

1. Not opinion, pure experience. Why do think most of the ortho veterans stick to the older stuff in the Ortho thread?
2. Hype as usual, don't tell me you're stuck on the hype bandwagon.
3. There was no revisions done. It was only a small upgrade to the back port filter, this was not a substantial change to be called a revision as evident by the model names still remaining the same. The change was done just so Sennheiser can use materials they grab hold of easier. They updated the 580/600/650 drivers from the dark black filter to the white less course filter in 2006/07. I know this because I emailed Sennheiser directly because i was concerned about night and day distinguishable differences which were not eventually.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
1. If I ever hear it, I'll let you know. The reason so many people started using these is the potential they had, and the relatively low price for orthodynamic drivers. Have you heard the latest Mad Dog headphones? 
2. I agree with you on all parts. Most people don't make them sound a lot better.
3. I also agree with you here. The word 'retuning' is up for debate. They put in a different grill and called it a new headphone.

You guys need to chill.
 
The idea here is to Rank YOUR headphones. If someone doesn't agree then take that disagreement elsewhere or keep it to yourself. People posting here shouldn't have to worry about someone bashing their own list of their own stuff. Or at the very least be respectful and talk it out without name calling or questioning anyone's intelligence.
 
Lets not act like A-holes people...
 
My list.
 
Music Cans:
 
1. LCD's 2.2 - Still working towards the proper amp but they still are by far the best I've ever heard or owned.
2. HD650 - Bought ef5 for LCD's and the HD650's paired up better and sounds fantastic
3. D5000 - Enough has been said, great cans with stupid deep bass.
4. s500 - Best value in the headphone world and more fun then nickel night at a _____ house
5. WS99 - Was very surprised with these. Didn't expect them to be as neutral yet with fast attacking deep bass. Great cans
6. esw9a - Love them. Great on ear cans with better bass than I was expecting. Wish I could have tried the esw11's
7. Porta Pro's - Classic
8. KSC 75 - Great for working out and bike riding
 
Gaming:
 
1. MMX-300 - Holy grail of gaming headphones
2. Siberia V2 - Good for the money and very comfortable
3. Astro a30 - Swiss army Knife of gaming headsets. All kinds of cool options and looks fantastic
 
 
Questions and conversation are more than welcome. D-Baggery is not.
 
 
 
Thanks,

I own the Paradox #5 so hearing you say the JH13 is inferior baffles me a bit; I was planning on getting the JH13 freqphase.
 
I mean, the T50RP Paradox is fantastic, but I'd compare it to headphones hovering around the 500$ range at most. Overall I'd put it between the HE400 and HE500, but both those headphones have it beat on pure resolution because of the superior drivers. However, the decay and linearity of the Paradox is incredible as that was the main point of the mod; making it a reference/monitoring headphone (as far as I'm concerned).
 
I'm listening to them right now as we speak as my curiosity was piqued; kind of really underwhelming after coming off a NAD m51>MC225>HD800 rig lol

I currently own only 2 headphones though I've been through a couple. I'll rate my two and rank a few of my favs according to memory
 
1. he-300
2. dt990pro

4. v-moda m80
5. px100ii ------------ 9/10

How much better are the ATH-M50 over the HD681 EVO?  The HD681 EVO is 1/2 the price and I'm wondering whether there is a vast improvement.

3. W1000X (J$ Beyer pads)
4. HD 650 / Q701
5. A900X
6. Image X10
 
Italics were recently sold.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I wouldn't consider either one better per say...
 
the EVO wins at bass extension, I feel it reaches a bit lower and has a bit more punch although theM50 has tighter bass
 
the EVO's mids a similar to the M50's maybe slightly more forward, but not much
 
I like the M50's highs better... they are very sparkly and bright (some find it too much) whereas the EVO to me sounds a bit rolled off too early.
 
sound stage on both is meh, the EVO being slightly bigger but not huge... it kinda gives you the impression that you have 3 directions of where sounds come from...
 
comfort to me is similar both cause sweaty ears with extended listening...
 
fit and finish on both is nice.
 
hope that helps... FYI I use my e17 to drive both of these, with no EQ adjustment

I'm going to cheat and rank headphones I've borrowed too.
 
1. Stax SR-009
2. Stax SR Omega II
3. Audeze LCD-3
4. Sennheiser HD-800
5. Sony MDR-R10 (bass light)
6. Symphones Magnums (V4 and VX in the aluminium sleeves.)
7. Foxtex TH-900
8. AT W3000ANV (I had fit issues though.)
 
There's very little in it between 3-6 and it comes down to preference really. The order would easily change depending on the amp used, for example. The Fostex at 7 doesn't really tell the full story though: They make up for their lower resolution than the orthos and 'stats by being supremely entertaining with all kinds of music, but with competence for a pair of closed headphones. For that with the cans higher up requires the right kind of tube amp and tubes. The TH-900s are far more forgiving of source and amp but do still scale with better gear.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'm liking them more the more I listen to them.
 
I was supposed to shave last night and be asleep by 10:30pm. Neither happened because of these.
 
I woke up early this morning just to listen to them. Still didn't shave. I might be late to work.
 
 
AT really pulled off some voodoo to get a traditional dynamic transducer to sound this good (e.g. without bio-cellulose technology, ring transducers and aerospace plastic, or high-tesla drivers).

An update to the list. Adding another headphone. Using a Schiit Magni on all the headphones.
 
1.) AKG K240 MKII: Fun and natural sounding. A bit on the dark side. Good bass. Great midrange and vocals. Pleasant and non fatiguing treble. Sounds the best with instruments of the headphones I own. These are my go to headphones for music.
 
2.) Sennheiser HD 555(soundstage modded): Airy and laid-back sounding, a bit on the bright-side but non-fatiguing. Good bass. Great soundstage, can be a bit scary real in some instances. My go to headphones for gaming and movies. Amplification pretty much fixed the issues had with them in the past(bad timbre and lack of detail).
 
3.) Sansui SS-2(Brainwavz HM5 pads): My vintage headphones. These have the best midrange of the headphones I own, the vocals are breathtaking and organic and it's midrange sounds extremely natural. The treble is a bit rolled-off and not harsh in any way. Doesn't sound like a closed headphone, surprisingly good imaging and soundstage. These are by far the smoothest sounding headphones I have. What prevents these from being my favorite is their really weak bass-response, it's there but has very little punch and seems recessed. My go to headphones for vocals.
 
4.) Sennheiser PX-100 ii: Fun and bassy. A slight veil in the treble. Good soundstage. My go to headphones for bassy music and portable use.
 
5.) Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro: I do not like these headphones on the Schiit Magni at all, sterile and lifeless yet bassy and bright. Seems to bring out the worst in music. I loved these on a warm tube amp, but they are a horrible match with the Magni in my opinion. These are good headphones, but they are a bad match for my system, thus I'm planning on selling them as I won't be able to get an amp to bring out their potential for a long time.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah the Magni won't do any favors to hp's with overly emphasized freqs. It's a very good amp and I was really impressed with it, but it will emphasize warts n' all, if there are any warts that is...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. UE TF10 - great all rounder
2. Shure SRH 840
3. Alessandro MS1a
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 

Yea, that's what I noticed about the amp. Compared to the Hifiman EF2A(stopped working after a few weeks) I had in the past, it's really flat and sterile on the DT 990s. Really good for warm and dark headphones though, seems perfect for darker or more neutral Senns. It can be a little harsh in the treble on the K240s at times due to the K240s 10khz spike, but the spike never causes me fatigue on the K240s and doesn't bother me much, but I would like a tad of the edge taken off. I would like an amp that smooths out the treble more though. Any suggestions on an amp that smooths out and tames the treble?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I do like my Audio gd C2.2 it has a nice relaxed tone and nothing seems emphasized including the treble. It also sounds quite airy with good soundstage for a SS amp. It comes with stock burr brown opamps that were a little too warm for my tastes but I replaced them with the much better opa627 and the treble is now very detailed and sweet with no hardness at all. (thats using the HD800's aswell) I've had quite a few amps come and go while I'm hanging on to this one. Quite a bargain for what you get. If you do look into it, makes sure its the C2.2 as opposed to the C2 as there where improvements including output power. If I remember rightly it gives about 3 watts into 32 ohms. 
 
Another bargain is the good ole' M-stage, I use one for my bedside rig and this also has nice treble. Not quite as smooth as the Audio gd but defo not hard sounding either. the M-stage is more suited for higher impedance hp's because of the lower current output (the exception is the K701/2's). Where as the Audio gd can cater for both high and low impedance in my experience.
 
Both amps can be fine tuned with different opamps. And remember, a very subtle difference can make or break a component! IMO :)

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 

Okay thank you, I'll keep those amps in mind, sounds like the C2.2 will be perfect with the current hungry K240 and other current hungry headphones. Yes it can make or break a device, I've even noticed some cables and DACs change the harshness on the components.
 
I was thinking about eventually getting the WooAudio WA6 as it's know to be on the dark side and really tames the treble, and I am a fan of the tube sound, but it will be a very long time until I can consider it. A solid state amp that suits my tastes is first on my list though. I'm done with buying headphones for now as it seems I need to focus on my system first.

"Fixing" transient response with a DSP (Digital Signal Processor)? How can that be done?? The transient response of a headphone is largely dependent on the mechanical and electrical properties of the headphone driver. How can that be fixed with signal processing without actually interfering with the original signal (which most of us don't want to do)? 
Edited by bracko - 5/10/13 at 11:38pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
The transient response of a headphone is (virtually) completely determined by its mechanical design. Electronics can't 'fix' it but may be able to produce an altered signal the listener finds more pleasing.

I am completely aware of what potential electronics and signal processing have. I have phd in signal processing. The op stated that the transient response of headphones can be fixed using dsp and i reacted on that. The only thing one can do is to alter the original signal not to fix the transient response.

PFF. You kidding? The HD800 simply cannot compare with the SR80i's speed. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



IKR. The Sr80i is among the best headphones I have EVER heard, only ever being beaten by the fierce iGrado.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Igrado's receiving a compliment on head fi?!? Must be a first! They are quite nice as a 30 minute listening session headphone, I'd say. If grado could ever re-design them so that they were actually comfortable and had a bit wider soundstage, they'd be just about the best value around. 
 
As far as the 80i's, I'm concerned about the frequency graph:
 
http://graphs.headphone.com/graphCompare.php?graphType=0&graphID[]=353&graphID[]=393&graphID[]=3331&graphID[]=1613&scale=30

Ultrasone HFI 780. Just got this last night and after listening to it for a good fifteen hours i think i finally found my favorite headphones. It has the qualities of almost all my favorite headphones. The metallic sheen of the Koss UR 40. The soundstage and speaker quality of the Audio Technica ATH AD700 without the graininess. The immersive crystal clear detail of the KRK Kns-8400. The openess of a open can yet its a closed can.
 
All of this while leaving the tone controls flat on my Onkyo TX-8555 stereo reciever. Will be messing with bass settings later to see if they give the incredible balanced bass of my Sony MDR XB500 headphones.
 
It will also be interesting to see what they sound like from the headphone out of my Samson MediaOne 3a active studio monitors. I've noticed the sound on some of my headphones is much more musical with the monitors compared to when they play on my stereo reciever which i usually have to play at a higer volume to get similar.Might be the built in amp of the monitors or just the sound of the Onkyo changing things. Might see about getting a more main stream stereo reciever like a Sony or Marantz and see if it gives me that old sound i loved in the 1970s and 80s the Samson Monitors are giving me.

Great approach. I could not believe how good sounding and powerful the vintage amps are. I now have two Kenwood KA-5700 integrated amps driving my main listening station and also my computer station.
After you start listening to vintage, you won't go back. Seriously. My Magni is gathering dust as is my Indeed G-3, not because they aren't good, they just can't compare to the Kenwoods. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have a K701 that is falling apart (foam rings disintegrated, headband plastic guides broken, etc.), Ultrasone Pro 900, and Beyerdynamic DT880 (just got one to replace the K701)
 
Just ranking them on my time with them, with DT880 just a few hours. I'm sure it could change, but only three phones to compare, well it really wouldn't matter in the big scheme of just enjoying the music. I' not an audiophile, so please excuse my rather obtuse and pedestrian description of their sounds.
 
For Classical, in the order of preference: DT880, K701, Pro 900. DT880 has reduced soundstage but offers more in the low end than the K701, its highs are liquid and smooth, and the pleasant tonal quality extends to the bass. K701 has this open, airy quality that resolves the instruments very well, but after listening to the DT880, its low end, while quite adequate, seems a bit lacking. For Classical, Pro 900 seems confused, the bass overpowers and buries the rest of the sound.
 
For Electronic / Pop: Pro 900, K701, DT880: Pro 900 to me has this strange ability to separate various sounds in the music of this genre. It may have to do with its S-Logic that places drivers askew into the low and front area, but it is as if I can enjoy the resolved sounds separately, ponder on that particular sound before moving to another interesting tidbit...the music is presented in a very fun and engaging way. K701 presents the sound in a more cohesive whole, but the amount of bass is quite adequate. Perhaps I need to burn in the DT880s but it seems in certain areas it feels I am being assaulted by a wall of sound. Or a 2x4 when the sibilance kicks in.

Since I got the Schiit Magni, the Denons are closer (in my ranking not in how they sound) to the DT-770 than when I had just the Graham Slee Novo, they sound less grainy and less sharp from the Magni than they sound from the Novo. I still somehow like the Beyers more, they have the cold steely sound which I can't really resist... Of course, the HD 650 cannot be challenged by either of those cans.

Let me preface this ranking by saying that it doesn't reflect the technical abilities or accuracy of any of my headphones to any significant, objective degree. It's simply a rank of those cans I get the most enjoyment out of in my collection, and I personally find some of the TOTL stuff too distractingly resolving to truly find immersion in the music. So, without further ado, here's my latest rankings:
 
 
Koss ESP/950
 
Grado PS1000
 
Mrspeakers Mad Dog (Dog Pads)
 
Beyerdynamic T5p
 
Sennheiser HD650
 
Grado SR60i
 
Fischer Audio FA-003
 
Klipsch S4i

That's it. After all the insanely high postings of the T50RP's (modded) I have set in stone my decision for my next purchase. T50RP's.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Don't do it unless you intend on having someone do professional work on them. They are truly horrible stock. And not much better modded. The only way you'll get a significant increase in performance is if you have a well-regarded modder to work on them for you. And that's expensive.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Uhh...they aren't truly horrible stock. Average, maybe (for its original cost of $74 though, I'd even venture to say a little above average if given adequate power), but not horrible. Worse than a stock Yamaha HP3 that's available for cheaper, sure, but when compared to the other stuff that costs $74, or even $100, they can hold their own. The modded pair I have sounds fine (about half a step down from the K702), and there's minimal damping in it.
 
And while I'm here:
1. K702
2. T50RP RexAEterna Modded
3. Yamaha HP3 Modded
4. ESW9
5. Sextett LP
6. K271
7. K181DJ
8. Realistic Pro 50
 
The rest haven't been used in so long I forgot what they sound like.

Honestly, when I heard the T50RP they were very crunchy and unrefined, and the bass rolled off a lot. They were decently fast but that was about the only perk that I heard. 
 
Belief or disbelief rests with you. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I assume you'll be doing your own modding, then? If you're familiar with modding, don't be dissuaded by any discouragement. There's plenty of documentation of effective mods on the giant T50RP thread, and there's nothing wrong with tinkering with something that doesn't cost too much.

For those wondering why i rank the m50 top; simply it does everything I want in a headphone. 
 
Ultrasones sound too metallic in comparison to the m50, They would've been ranked much higher if i had not heard the m50.

Good question. Don't get me wrong I love the grados but the pxcs are a decent all-round headphone aswell - all be it a lot more expensive. They both have similarities in their presentation (i.e rolled off bass and forward midrange). But the pxcs take the lead due to their comfort. You can wear them for hours and hours, whereas the grados get annoying Edited by bundynice - 5/28/13 at 2:22pm

Triple Post!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Philips HP910 (with Amp)
- balanced, soundstage and extended bass. Needs several days burn time. No Amp? Forget it.
 
ATH A900
- Nice sound but need heavy Eq tweak. Also need some burn time but not as long as HP910. Very tiring for long term use: heavy
 
Only 2, others I don't really like.

Ultrasone HFI-780- Amazing soundstage and a very well rounded detailed sound that revels in treble and bass harmony. A closed headphone thats like having an open headphone on the level of the Audio Technica ATH AD700 but without the grainy sound or leakage disadvantages. While the soundstage of the AD700 feels slightly overdone with its huge almost echo like soundstage as if your in the middle of nowhere in the Grand Canyon the HFI-780 on the other hand gets the soundstage just right making it feel like your relaxing in your audio treated room with some amazing speakers.
 
Sennheiser HD 280 Pro- Best isolation I have seen in a headphone similar to wearing ear plugs. Excellent powerful bass that doesn't overpower the treble. Treble is very good but it doesn't have the sparkly peak of the Audio Technica ATH AD700 or Koss UR40.
 
Audio Technica ATH AD700- Very detailed with an incredible soundstage. Many people say its bass anemic but for me just messing with the bass settings on my Onkyo TX-8555 stereo receiver brings out all the bass I could ever want. The bass is more a metallic slam or thump and not the boom boom you might hear from a car blasting it on the streets. There is an omnipresent grainy sound to the AD700's signature which some may or may not like. I find it brings out more detail in new wave, ambient and classical pieces. If not for it being so open letting in a lot of environmental distractions it would be my 2nd place headphone.

I have 3 over ear headphones only.
This may be a surprise to some of you but this is how I would rank them
1. Superlux 681 evo-amazingly neutral, soundstage, details, just great
2. Ath m50-most impactful. Bass is great and the highs are just right
3. Senn 428-still very neutral. Sounds "robotic" though. Most bass shy
Now I'm still a noob so I don't know how accurate those descriptions may be to all of you lol.

I think it's time for an update to my old rankings.
 
1. Sony MDR-V6 (modded, using Beyer EDT-231v, and a smidgen of damping)
 
Justifying this is going to be impossible to you people, even my mate thinks I'm full of s***...but, explanation as best I can put it in the spoiler.
Warning: subjective opinions ahead.  No flaming, please. (Click to show)
From here on out I'll refer to these as the m-V6.  The m-V6 have a wonderful lushness to the lower and median mids, inoffensive controlled upper mids that are still a bit forward and provide bite, but are naturally wet, (no disgusting Sahara Desert effect here) and bass that lays a proper foundation for the music.  They behave like chameleons in quite a few ways, especially bass quantity, transparent to the source (song) you're asking them to do.  Most importantly however, they have a roundness to the lower and median midrange's sound, things seem to step forward near the center and recess as they near their sonic boundaries. (not necessarily in space, though)  It's a very strange, euphonic experience, and I'm in love with it, I can only hope this is the merest taste, and the TH900 and HE90 provide this to its fullest extent, throughout the entire range.  The controversial part, now: the m-V6 is very technically capable, it doesn't smooth over anything, and its attack and decay keep pace with more expensive fare.  It's just as good as the HD600 in this regard.
 
Now, of course these are not without their faults, not by a long shot.  The m-V6 still has a dip in its median midrange, which is inoffensive to me, but other people may really not like it.  To me, having a dip in the lower mids is what creates a nasty suckout that leaves the headphone sounding bone-dry and unnatural as all get out.  The m-V6 is also missing extension above about 14kHz and below 80Hz or so.  EQing the treble up really helps them with their already excellent sense of space and air.  Their soundstage is average, but imaging is pretty good, giving them a nice dimensionality.  There's plenty of things I wish I could change about the m-V6, but for now they remain the most satisfying, musically engaging headphone I own.  I can really just forget I'm listening to headphones so easily with these.  (I feel I have to say this: I am not you, don't go running out to get a pair and mod them because I love them, chances are you will not like them, my sensibilities deviate from standard audiophile sensibilities at almost every turn.)  I feel I should mention too, my V6s are new production.

 
 
2. Sennheiser HD600
 
I feel I need to follow up here, explaining why these are second to a V6, of all things.
Warning: subjective opinions ahead!  Don't get your panties in a bunch! (Click to show)
There are a couple issues I'd like to address here.  It may be because I'm sensitive to 10kHz peaks, but...the HD600s really hurt my ears.  Like, they give me temporary tinnitus whose duration is directly proportional to how long I listened for.  They have this horrible dryness to the upper midrange around the 10kHz area, with a bloom to it, that I'm going to explain with Tyll's plots for them.  The THD can be seen to start rising towards 10kHz though the measurements don't go that high; this combined with the frequency response peak at 10kHz, is what I believe to be causing this.  The end effect is a piercing resonance, and making the headphone sound dusty and dry like a desert.  Ignoring that, they're technically proficient headphones, sure, but their tonality aside from the peak seems dry and a bit too thin to me, this isn't what real life sounds like at all.  I've known for a while now, I'm sensitive to tonality, and quite a stickler about it too.  My issues with this are the horrendous peak, not enough treble, cerebral, coughing mouse bass response that gives absolutely no grounding element or base foundation to the rest of the sound, and a general dryness.  Altogether, they pulled an RS2i on me; that is to say I tricked myself into liking them at first, and realized I had all these problems with the way they reproduced sound after hearing something that did things more to my liking.  Funny how the human brain can be a dick like that.
 
Maybe an amp can fix it.  Maybe not.  You shouldn't have to correct a headphone's flaws, the design should be competent enough to lack major issues to correct.  Tonality,  yes, sure have at it with the EQs and tube amps, that's very personal and no stock headphone will ever give you EXACTLY what you want on the first go.  Distortion, resonance, narrow band peaks?  That should have been fixed in the R&D stages.  This is a very old headphone, though, it isn't surprising that this resonance was considered acceptable, it's less bright than most headphones at the time were.

 
 
3.Beyerdynamic DT1350
Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show)
Going off what I remember, I don't have these here at the moment, but they had much the same issue as the HD600 does for me, but they're a less proficient headphone all around, so they rank lower.

 
 
4.Grado RS2i maybe?
Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show)
I wouldn't listen to them for any length of time again, and they've been sold anyway.  Still, may be more techinically proficient than the DT1350, but their frequency response really holds them back.

 
 
5. Everything Else  (It's all pretty damn bad to me)
 
 
...
 
 
Second to Last: Sony MDR-V6 (stock)
 
Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show)
This is a HORRIBLE headphone, its a blurred, splashy, uncontrolled mess who has an upper mid spike that splits the heavens (and your skull) with the stock pads.  Who knew it could have any potential?  I found my modification for it by accident, too.

 
 
Last Place:  Reserved for the most awful, offensive headphone I've ever heard: the Audatron SH-608r.
 
Warning: Spoiler! (Click to show)
Nothing will ever top this.  In stock form or modded.  I removed it from my headphone inventory, I'm so ashamed to own it.

Sadly I don't use my HD681-EVOs because they are just too darn big for my head. I guess the originals were as well, but you can force the headband to go even smaller, since the plastic bits can barely slide over the plastic backing of the phones.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Based on recent usage:
 
1. Grado RS2 (semi-vintage, blue dragon recabled): they have the most head time just because my music taste leans quite a bit towards singer-songwriter and guitar driven stuff. These phone are magical with guitar (I don't have a problem with bright treble, I think it certainly helps keep things energetic). Bass is sufficient and vocal is quite good on these.
 
2. Hifiman HE-400: paired with the right amp, these can be great all-rounder. Love the bass, soundstage and clarity. Vocal is ok, nothing to write home about. For guitar I still prefer the RS2 for their intimacy.
 
3. Kenwood KH-K1000: the only closed cans I still hold on to, also a good all-rounder. They render everything nicely although they might be a bit slow for electronic. Bass is rounded and extends fairly well. These are mostly used for female vocals.
 
4. Panasonic RP-HTF600 (closed back modded, DT250 pads): very comfortable, for when I don't care for the desktop rig. These surprise me from time to time about how good $30 cans perform.

Comfort:
AKG K240
Grado sr80i
Sennheiser Amperior
 
The sennheiser amperior is unfortunately not the most comfortable headphone but it does have a very fun and punchy, upfront sound. The sr80i definitely has the edge on the AKG K240. I think the K240 just has a too laid back sound. Unfortunately the amperior's comfort gets a bit 'ouch' after a while, so I end up switching between the sr80i with my portable amp and the Amperior. I prefer the amperior over all though. If only the amperior just had a straight cord without this connector on it. It's kind of bulky.

i hv made a timetable for my headphones.. well i listen to each and every headphone before i sleep.. but this time table is only for holidays..
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have two pair..
 
One is a pair of Microsoft LX-3000 media headset.
I got it for the mic about six years ago for $30. It now goes for ~$23 on Amazon.
It really is the best value headset out there in my opinion.
First of all, the **** is durable. I have not been gentle to them at all and they show almost no signs of wear.
The sound is balanced. I mean, none of it is very good. It sounds decent with a good EQ, but the USB interface I think is what makes them as good as they are.
But it doesn't really have a weak point. It isn't like you think "Wow, the bass is just mud on these.." or "Where the mids at" or "The highs just sound dull or covered with tin foil"
It's more like listening to a poorly encoded audio file.
Great for gaming, travel, or casual use for those on a budget. I recommend them.
 
The other is a long-term borrow pair of AKG K240 Monitors.
They have absolutely beautiful highs and mids, but their mid bass and sub bass is just gone.
While it's perfectly fine for rock, acoustic, classical, and 80's synth, (the music of the days they are from) they suck for dubstep and hip hop as half the song is missing, and the subtle bass undertone is a large part of good dubstep. It sets the mood for the whole track.
They're a little awkward to wear since they're huge, but I really like how the band flexes so much.
The open back design is a problem in the real world. Fine in a studio, but...

 I only have three headphones at present but I will list all my phones that I have used.
1) akg 701 I have over the time I have owned them gone back and forth on my preference between the 701s and the lcd2.Presently i prefer the 701 for its distinct advantage over the lcd2 v2 on soundstage reproduction which is a definite shortcoming of the lcd2.
2) audeze lcd2 v2 Marvelously musical and rarely if ever never sounds less than at least good but is not the most neutral headphone around.
3) stax lamda pro with the dedicated tube amp.wonderfully transparent but let down by the amp.Amp sounded very tubey in the old fashion tube fashion.Bas was rather tubby and dynamics were just not all that great.The amp did improve somewhat when I used a siver wire homemade power cord from a friend.This tightened up the amp and made it more neutral sounding and a lot quicker.
4) stax lambda with energizer box(rewired with high quality wiring)Transparent sounding when used with my old threshold amp that I had at the time
5) yamaha orthodynamic headphones from the 70s do not remeber what the model was but these were of an open back design that would fold up.From what i rememeber they were light pretty comfortable and wer very easy to drive.They sounded pretty neutral from what I can remeber and sounded good even when driven by the headphone amp section of various receivers and tape decks that I had at the time.I think these would have been interesting to hear with a modern headphone amp.I think they would have been pretty good.
6) grado rs1i easy to drive but definitely not the most neutral headphone design.A little tipped up in the high end.Very uncomfortable headphone for long term listening sessions.The headband design on this phone is a joke reminiscent of ham radio headsets of long ago.
7) several pairs of koss pro 4aa headphones.These were popular at the time  in the seventies but the coiled headphone cord would eventually cause the headphone to cut in and out from beeing stressed.That is why I went thru several of these.From what I can remember they were very heavy and you would eventually sweat and your ears would flush from the liquid filled headphone ear cushions.I thought they sounded pretty good at the time.

6) grado rs1i easy to drive but definitely not the most neutral headphone design.A little tipped up in the high end.Very uncomfortable headphone for long term listening sessions.The headband design on this phone is a joke reminiscent of ham radio headsets of long ago.
7) several pairs of koss pro 4aa headphones.These were popular at the time  in the seventies but the coiled headphone cord would eventually cause the headphone to cut in and out from beeing stressed.That is why I went thru several of these.From what I can remember they were very heavy and you would eventually sweat and your ears would flush from the liquid filled headphone ear cushions.I thought they sounded pretty good at the time.

Liking the HD 700 more than the HD 800? I and my wallet like reading that.

Lawls. I was thinking the same thing.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
 

THe music details in HD800>>HD700. the mid range is really what i like about hd800. but hd700 has something that engages me more.. does well with my music. i am into rock,metal more.. so hd700 is little better for these genres. if classical,jazz,acoustic songs are ur choice then u will like hd800.hd700 doesnt deliver that sound.. its personal liking is'nt it...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

currently
1) He500 + OCC cable (dont like the silver ones at all)
2) HD600+oyaide cable (its not really my taste but cant be denied that this is very good cans)
3) ATH W1kx = Denon D5k cant really decide
4)Hd25
5)Shure940

I'm just happy to read things like this. Trying to decide between the HE-500 and HD 700, so any info matters to me.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


As always it depends on your tastes. The HD700 has some peaks in the mids and treble that many people find highly engaging, and also give the impression of greater detail, but I personally don't like it as it makes some voices sound unnatural. HE-500 has a smoother, flatter, more natural sounding midrange.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. audio-technica a900x
 
2. audio-technica ad700
 
3. sennheiser hd201
 
mainly got the audio-technica products because i'm a fan of japanese products as they've never done me wrong up to this point... never had any faulty products or had to return anything in my life and everything i've bought lasted a long time, with mainly sticking to known quality japanese brand stuff.
 
the hd201 only cost me 14 dollars but i don't listen to them, they're hard as rocks on your ears and make my ears hurt very quick.
 
the audio-technica's served me well, both fairly comfortable in terms of wearing them an average of 6 hours a day and both sound decent unamped on my pc.
the a900x being the superior pair.
(although both pairs cause slight irritation at times with 10 hour+ use)
 
i'm in the market for a new pair that will take over for my a900x, not sure what i'm getting yet but i might be going german with the hd600.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I think the HD600 would be a good choice. The A900X has really forward mids which the 600's don't but the 600's have much better bass. The soundstage is much better on the A900X though IMO.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
yeah that seems to be the logical path to go from the unamped level of a a900x/ad700 into the amped world of the higher end.
the only snafu is that i like the look of the dt880 more, the ear pads on the dt880 look so comfortable! (comfort is very important to me as i wear headphones long hours) and the overall design looks slightly better to me.
not sure which has the superior build quality apart from looks.
(as i understand it they are about equal in terms of sound)
Edited by Nowhere - 6/5/13 at 11:39am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

If I were in your position, I would probably get the DT880's too. I haven't tried them myself, but given the reviews and comparisons to the HD600, the 880's seem like the obvious choice seeing as you can get them "like new" for $215 on Amazon.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I know frequency response graphs don't tell the whole story.... but really?

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

You're looking at the wrong graphs.  Try looking at Purrin's HD700 graphs.  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Plus the Beyers are German so you know build quality will be second to none. If it helps, I find the 770s comfortable but after long listening my ears sometimes feel a bit tender.

Personally, I find them to be tad boring, and they are rarely used because SRH940 has much better clarity and detail.

Spend 1500$ to finally get some clarity with the hd800, and still the  top highs feel "controlled" somehow (a bit smooth and not too aggressive , even if not lacking in amount).
If you are not a fan of "senn house" sound, just try some other brand.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



But the porta pro would  sound better with a good source too .
 
In my case, I'm tempted to rank the ksc75 above my hd595, but the ksc75 have a more grainy sound, and comfort is off course not the same. So I conceive that people would like the sound signature of ksc75 more than the hd595;  but in term of refinement , I believe the higher price is justified.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

portapro are 24 ohm headphone they will do well when plugged directly to the source in other case hd600 are 300 ohm headphones. they need power to gv its best... amp will supply the required power. and i rate ksc75 more than my hd515(u can see my list). portapro's r not as accurate as ksc75(imo). hd5X5 series was bad. but the improvement in 5X8 is awesome.as well in hd6XX group..

I expect even a poorly powered HD600 would outperform the PPs from most peoples perspective, I imagine his dislike for them is deeper than that. I still find it hard to believe though considering they're the least favourite pair in my collection!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 

I don't find it too surprising, I found the Senn sound doesn't float some peoples boats, I'm personally not really a Senn fan, something about them sounds wrong to me. For me I haven't listened to a Senn I truly felt was worth the price. I much rather have a K240, K70x, or DT 990(with a decent tube amp to add warmth and tame the treble), etc. than a HD 600/650.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Doesn't PortaPro and KSC75 use the same driver? Or is that SportaPro? Years ago I had a Koss portable headphone with a titanium driver, KSC35? They were decent for the price too.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


KSC35 and PortaPro and SportaPro have the same driver. KSC75 and KTXPro1 have that same driver but it has been titanium coated.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Because of absolutely no fault of the can. I really love my HD 600 for certain genres. I just prefer sparkly and agressive signatures.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Made some minor adjustments 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


When I saw your list, I wasn't that surprised. The HD580s are great headphones, but I don't hardly listen to them because they don't have the signature that I want for most of my music. I'm guessing that the price of the PP and the 600's have an effect on your ranking? In terms of "value" it's not surprising at all to see HD600's at the bottom of someone's list (not saying that's why they're at the bottom of yours). On the other hand, it isn't surprising to see them at the top of others' lists. Personally, if I spent the MSRP on HD600's, HE-400's, and X1's, I'd have a very hard time justifying the HD600 price tag.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yup, you nailed exactly what I was thinking. I'm taking all aspects into consideration. I feel like I have more fun with the PP on my head vs the HD 600 and it doesn't hurt that I'm thinking, "Man, all this sound and fun for $40?!"
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


ksc75 only for 15$, and better sound than PP according to reviews here. Comfort is not great though.
One day, I'd get the dj100, just because I'm curious.

My priorities are speed, soundstage, detail, and sparkle. Would you still go HE-500?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The HE-400 has more sparkle than the HE-500 from what I've read. They may be a better bang for the buck option, though they have a recessed upper midrange/lower treble. Definitely the fastest and most detailed pair of cans I own and they are very sparkly (I have to EQ the highs down a little due to my ears' sensitivity to high freq).

Senn HD800
Brainwavz B2
Audio Technica AD2000x
Atrio M7
Grado SR-80
Denon AHD2000
TDK B200 (IEM)
 
I'm slowly moving up the can list, but for the longest time, I was solely an IEM user. The B2 is my most used and favorite overall, but the HD800 is something that I really appreciate when I listen to. AD2000x is really fun and is a can I can drive off my portable set-up really easily. I have the Atrio out of loyalty (FS1 was my first decent headphone/IEM), but it is rarely used over the B2.
 
The bottom two, I'm strongly considering selling. The recessed mids on the Denon annoy me -they sound fine on some recordings, dull on others- and the sound signature of the TDK is just boring. The SR80 is good for simple computer usage, it's great for casual listening (I found the PS500 to not be all that much better, aside from tighter and stronger bass).
 
Amps - Digizoid Zo, Leckerton 6 UHA MKII, Marantz SACD8004 headphone out, KR9400 vintage receiver (drives the SennHD800 beautifully)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


How much  do you use your hd800 ? You give the feeling of appreciating the sound quality of hd800, but somehow, it doesn't completely work for you.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Most phones will have synergies with certain amps. I believe the HD800 to be end game phones and can appreciate their potential even though I don't have an amp (yet) to do them justice. So this is where I am right now with the gear I have.

The HD800 is headphone sex and mine's not even completely burned in yet. The issue is I do most of my listening in the office and open-back headphones that require amplification don't fit that profile too well. In contrast, over the past 2 years or so, I've listened through my entire CD collection (over 1000 albums) using my B2 and Zo in the office. I know all the nuances of that pairing and is just a very friendly, familiar and airy sound.
 
But one thing I look forward to now when coming home from the office is burning a disc and running it through the HD800. It's genuinely satisfying on a level the B2 doesn't quite reach, hence why I put the HD800 at the top, even if it only sees an hour or two of listening each day.

Hey now, be nice. The HD280 wasn't bad at all when I gave it a listen. A bit lacking in detail and speed sure but it was certainly better than quite a few other headphones in its price range.
Though the KOSS PRO DJ200 I tried soared above and beyond it in terms of sound quality and musical enjoyment for only $30 more. Really good cans.

When you put it on, the clamping pressure and sound immediately force you to evacuate your bowels and brain matter drips from your nose. It's that bad. I'll throw mine up on the trade forum for free this week and only ask someone for shipping costs. It's just collecting dust at this point.

Unless the CD900ST really is as special as people claim... care to enlighten us to its characteristics?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Oh, I never pass up a chance to gush about the CD900STs. 
 
Hands down the best headphones I've heard. I've been fortunate enough to listen to a great deal of $700+ headphones, and no headphone has lined up it's sound signature up so perfectly with my taste in music. (I listen to mostly folk and soft rock, so that should give you an idea of where I'm coming from.)
 
The mids are completely, and utterly unparalleled. Infinitely detailed, yet completely lacking in harshness, with excellent lower-mid body. Soundstage is overall very small, but it works very well for the sound signature. Vocals sound almost perfectly realistic, to the point where the singer sounds like they're singing right in front of your face.
 
Bass and treble is definitely not what most people would consider great, but they get the job done. Bass is a little rolled off, but reasonably detailed. Similarly, treble is a tad rolled off, and is generally down in level. It doesn't sound muffled, but it doesn't really sparkle.
 
But man, those mids... I mean, even Head-fi favorites like the HE-500's don't even come close. Definitely a headphone every mid-head should make an effort to try.

I don't like the hd 280 either, but it's still not a BAD headphone. Even though I feel like my skull is going to crack into pieces when I put them on and the lower mids sound extremely hollow, I still feel that they're not a bad value for $100.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Bad enough to give them away. :)

You are probably the only person on earth thinking k501 has agressive mids. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Hah, no doubt, but to me, they are so harsh I can't see how a person wouldn't find them harsh. As far as open AKG headphones I've heard, I think the K601, K702, and K500's all have much, much smoother mids.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I believe something was wrong with the pair you had. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
They generally fit the description most people described them as, it's just the mids that were vastly different. I thought it might be my amp, since it's slightly forward, and not totally up to the task of powering them, but having tried them on my friend's Lyr, it still didn't help.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Strange. In my experience k501 has the most crisp and delicate mids of all of the headphones that I own. Agressive and harsh are not the epithets I would ever use to describe their midrange. Not only that, the overall balance of the headphone is really good, especially when using k701 pads. I own HD650, k701, DT660 and ATH-M50. I have compared k501 to many, many other headphones too, HD600, HD800, k702 Annies, DT880, DT990, a couple of Grados and Ultrasones and there is no aggressiveness in the mids (or anywhere else) to talk about.   
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


UR40 uses the same drivers as the KSC75 as well.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Besides the K1000 which I haven't heard, the K501 is imvho the best modern day AKG headphone in a long time by a long shot. Followed by the K601, the 70X series is a mess. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Update (I'm getting that feeling we all get after each headphone purchase -- the one that tells you that you're done buying headphones):
 
1. HE-400 - clarity, detail, speed, need I say Drum & Bass?
2. X1 - comfy bass cannons
3. MS1000 - punchy soundstage master
4. T50RP - the cans with the most potential to move up/down the list with incremental modding
5. M100 - holy portability, Batman!
6. HD580 - reference/movies
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

These ones get regular listening, and I tend to rotate through them for different genres/refreshing take with a different sound sig
1) HE-500
2) DT880
3) HE-400
4) HD-600
5) Westone 4
 
Should probably not have anymore, and tend to collect dust. Could use them as birthday presents for friends and family.
6) AD900x
7) MS2i
8) DBA MKII
9) V Moda M100

The Lyr is quite good with the K701, it actually makes them sound musical.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I wish I still had the K701s when I had the Lyr. I've only heard great things with the pairing. So much better than the Lyr/Ed. 8s.   (Inside joke here folks).
 .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I would say the Q701 is better than the K400, K501 and K601. Of course this depends on preferences as always. Those last three I'd rank above the K702 though maybe. Hmm, maybe I'd take the K702 over the K400 with stock pads, but not sure.
 
FYI as you may know, the Q701 sounds slightly different than the K702/1. Had the K702 and K701 several times.
 
Not sure where I'd rank the K702 Anniversary, but i'm not a fan of that at all. I'd much rather have a K601.

Yes the Ed8 was not the greatest pairing with the Lyr to put it mildly!

I'd imagine the noise floor was ridiculous.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Can someone explain the whole Lyr /Ed. 8 thing? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) HD-600 (for CD listening)
2) ATH-L2 (for the office)
3) HD-418 (for walks and travel)
4) JVC Gumy (for bedtime podcasts)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Actually there was zero noise floor. It killed grokit's and my Ed.8s. Blew the drivers. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Are you being sarcastic? Lol 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Oh god. First that was funny, now its painful to read. 
 
I never thought I'd blow a headphone, but then I used my SE-700 with my Asgard, and during a dense moment in one of my songs the right side just suddenly lost ALL of its treble. I wasn't even listening that loud, I don't know how it happened. It still makes sound somehow but its majorly imbalanced from the left side. 
 
I heard that the problem with the SE-700 is that the electrical connection to the PVDF film gets severed at extreme volumes, but wouldn't that mean that the driver would stop making noise entirely? Furthermore, the drivers are rated for 30v and the Asgard only swings 20V p-p if I remember correctly. I had the gain set to low and I was nowhere near max volume on the pot. I thought the issue might've been my poor solder job on the plug, but I redid it three times and it didn't change anything.
 
ANOTHER factor to consider is that I also have the SE-500 and I listen to it at the same volume levels on a regular basis, and it's totally fine. It really doesn't make any sense to me.

Odd, the K1000 is kind of rare and when it does show up the prices go insane, I'd be surprised if he had heard it.

They are unobtaniums now with extremely high commanding prices when they do pop up here or on eBay. Heck they use to sell for $500-600 here years back before they were discontinued. 
 

True, they are still on my radar but man the prices are ridiculous.
 

If only wink...if only.... 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Hell, the MSRP was $500. The way people extrapolate things like that baffles me.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah because people are greedy. Because some thing purchased originally for $500 and all of a sudden it is discontinued it gives them a qualified reason to sell the headphone at $1000. But yet again this doesn't limit to just headphones.

Less than a decade ago you'd be hard pressed not to find a K1000 at a meet. Of all the TOTL out-of-production headphones they enjoyed the most production and sales AFAIK. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


That makes those AKGs a bargain 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Koss Pro DJ 100 / Tony Bennett (I now have both!)
I like it's nice and full mids, good low bass and lack of an annoying mid-bass hump. It's treble is also very smooth to me.
Strangely this has benefited more from amp/dac changes than my Q701 and K400. About as much as my HD-650. Call me nuts if you want!
If I had to live with only one headphone this would be it. Oh yeah, despite the ugly graphs, I find it to have slightly emphasized upper mids (like a Grado!).
 
AKG Q701
Better sounding than the Anniversary, K400, K501, Sextett and K601 IMO. If this didn't exist I'd keep the K601 or K400 with K601 pads.
Possibly the only perfect headphone I've owned. Not even my precious DJ100 is perfect (stupid pads!). I think it doesn't need any more warmth or stupid bass.
 
Sennheiser HD-650
This one sounds very flat and has just a tiny bit more low bass extension than my Q701. No mid-bass hump or lack of treble here.
It does sound warm, but not too warm. The HD-600 definitely had more mid-bass. Weird. I had two pairs a few years back and they were dark and had more mid-bass.
Maybe I have a crappy pair  I love it though. I gave this headphone a second chance after not liking the old pairs. Not sure what happened. Same gear mostly.
 
Sennheiser HD-598
 
Amazing soundstage but the sound is grainier than the HD-650. I've found it to have more treble and to be a little more detailed.
It's smooth sounding yet still fun and energetic(!). I especially love it for female vocals. They do sound more forward and clearer though on the Q701.
Since I have the Q701 and prefer that, this gets almost zero use. Mine is recabled with Mogami W2893. Yes, it was worth the $10 
I don't think this is at the same level as the HD-598, but I love how easy it is to drive.
 
AKG K400
 
I generally find it to be a bit thin with my setup. My amp isn't warm or cold really. To get past that it does sound better with K601 and K702 pads.
It's the 2nd headphone that actually WOWED me when playing acoustic music. The first was the ATH-AD2000.
 
I actually think this has more treble than my Q701! It does have a larger soundstage too.
 
KRK KNS-6400
 
Not enough time to listen to this. I also had the 8400 but accidentally destroyed it. Oops.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I thought I'd update my top 5 since I recently made an upgrade to my gear, which impacted my headphone rankings. 
 
Tie 1) Beyerdynamic T1 - Now that I have upgraded my amp/DAC, these phones have clearly taken a step up in performance. I'm now hearing more of their potential, and they've pulled even with my beloved Grados. 
 
Tie 1) Grado PS500 - These headphones never cease to amaze me with how beautiful they sound even from a source as simple as my Kindle Fire. I've been a fan of the Grado sound since my first listen to my SR80s about a year and a half ago, and the 500s just tick all the boxes for me. 
 
3) Grado GS1000i - Although higher in the pecking order than the 500s and having a much more attractive appearance, they fall a bit short of my favorite Grados. 
 
4) Beyerdynamic DT1350 - Dollar for dollar, these phones are nearly perfect, IMO. The only area I have picked on them about was comfort, and they are addressing that with an updated model coming out in August of 2013. I love that the current pads keep my ears nice and cool, but I typically have about a 2-hr max with them until I need a break. But in terms of sonics, I don't know what more I could ask for at this price point. 
 
5) Grado SR80s - These are the phones that started it all for me. After initially being let down by my first headphone purchase (Sennheiser 518), these 80s were the spark that proved to me that I could find aural bliss outside of my speaker rig. 
 
 

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

As of right now my preference goes: my self modded T50rp > Vsonic GR01 > AKG Q701. 
 
My preferences have changed since spending more time modding my T50rp. My T50rp beats my Q701 in every area except for soundstage width, but in reality the Q701's soundstage width might be too much really. It is far wider than it is deep. The T50rp images much better and has better depth, and sounds just as good or better in every other aspect of SQ. I have also been spending a lot of time with my GR01 in ears lately since getting my new Samsung Galaxy S4 and the sound has also regrown on me. The GR01 sound very similar to the way I have my T50rp tuned. My T50rp has better bass extension though. The GR01 actually makes the Q701 sound a tad bass light and thin now as well.

1. Sony MDR-EX600 ($150 bought a year ago) - it took a while for these to come up on top. They are the most dynamic of my headphones. I'm listening to some psy-trance on these at moment and they are immensely enjoyable. The bass extends deep, and is very detailed. I've had them for about a year and its taken that time to appreciate them. I played around for ages trying the various tips, and something wasn't right. Just recently realized that one of the interconnects was not on perfectly, and it subtly messed with one of the channels. Not sure about burn in, but I've gone from thinking these were too sharp, and not bassy enought to being familiar with it. These are my first choice for music, but depending on genre will become fatiguing. Their design, a bit unusual, is very comfortable. Oh and I wouldn't even think of using these for gaming, bullets will sound like they are peircing your ear drums.
There are times listening to these headphones I can pretend I have an audiophile system in my room.
2. Shure SRH-840 ($100 purchased 4 years ago)- for my large head these are very comfortable. The pads are perfect and I can wear them for ages. These are just great studio headphones, and they are also the best of my headphones for gaming, better than the Koss TBSEs (I know tdockweiler loves these, but the Shure I feel is even better for this application). I've heard this headphone described as trebly but I think they are just fine. They can't match the low extension of the EX600, but have better bass than than the Koss TBSE. They have a great tonal balance. Detail is there. They have a more full, luscious quality than the Koss TBSE.
3. Koss Tony Bennett Signature Editions (bought this past week) - these are good headphones. I just switched them on from going from the Ex600, and it doesn't have near the impact. Running through my Rotel, I get a bit more impact, and I'll take tdockweilers word that these improve with better equipment and source, which unfortunately, I do not have at my disposal. Now oddly, after listening to these for a matter of minutes, you acclimatize to them, and you start forgetting some of their deficiencies. I do like these headphones quite a bit. For a closed headphone they have pretty good imaging a bit better than the 840. They aren't as comfortable as the 840s, and put a bit of pressure on my larger ears. I have a fair bit of DJ experience, and I wouldn't have a problem using these for that purpose. There is something both cheap and classy about these headphones. All in a good way. They are the least fatiguing sonically of my headphones, isolate pretty good, and have replaced my EX600 as my work headphone (the swivel cups making it much easier to listen to colleaugues, or take a phone call).
Listening to Wes Montgomery Impressions the Verve Sides, no problem picking out the background room sounds, conversations and glasses being shaken, and sounding quite real.
I picked the TBSE up for $30, and that is a steal for what may be an under appreciated somewhat average, unoffensive, all-rounder. It won't get in the way of enjoying your music, but it won't reveal all there is. Seems a number of head-fires that own these have technically better headphones yet keep these around. Pretty much says it.
Oh and they come with a great case and detachable cable.
4. JVC FX66 - tons of muddy bass, a whole range of frequency missing. Good if you are at the gym, not really listening. Isolate quite well and are quite comfy. You can listen in bed with these with an ear to the pillow. Forgettable.Edited by Malfunkt - 6/27/13 at 10:18pm

 I like Skullcandy because there cheap (70$ for the Hesh, 40$ for the earbuds), I think they look good (I'm 16). Don't get me wrong I don't think Skullcandy is the best headphone brand I would love to have a pair V-moda headphones but for the moment the Hesh does it's job.

tied for 2. Klipsch x10- my newest pair of IEM's at a steal of a price and are fantastic because of portability and even the packaging was fantastic and the sound is well-rounded and accurate
4. Klipsch S4i Rugged Edition- not exactly amazing anymore but get use for when going to the gym

8. apple buds- infamously bad and easily breakable(unused for obvious reasons)

An update to my list, a new headphone has been added and a few removed.
 
1. (tie) AKG K240 MKII(Zu Mobius MKII Cable) - Detailed, musical, intimate, rich, warm, smooth, and natural sounding. The treble has a bit of an aggressive edge to it and the mid-bass and upper bass are a bit on the prominent side but it's part what it makes it so enjoyable aside from the engaging midrange. Great comfort.
 
1. (tie) Sony MDR-MA900 - Detailed, very neutral, musical, spacious, great imaging and soundstage, slightly warm sounding, smooth, natural sounding, just the right amount of treble and bass compared to midrange. Very comfortable.
 
2. Sennheiser HD 555(soundstage modded) - Very laid-back and smooth and good soundstage and imaging. Boring and lifeless midrange, too much sub-bass, detail doesn't compare to the two above headphones. Doesn't sound very natural despite being quite neutral, tonality is off. It's a league or two below the headphones listed above in overall sound reproduction. Clamps too much to comfortable for long period of time. Only keeping this headphone because it's the headphone that started my audio journey.

3. Denon D600 - extremely comfortable and fun to listen to, surprisingly well-controlled, tight bass and great clarity after significant burn-in
4. AKG Q701 - just got these, so they gotta earn their keep - silky smooth, warm and detailed
5. Sennheiser HD439 - comfortable, natural sound, for use with my portable devices
6. ATH-M30 - my first pair of decent headphones, just don't get enough respect - warm, comfortable and clear sounding, small soundstage though

Just like anyone else, I was trying to find my niche sound preference. I started with the HFI 580s; they were fun, but it didn't live up to its hype (to my ears). The vsonic gr07 was a purchase for taking to work and grad school. I figured the bass, yet still near neutral, would help compensate fr the public noise. They didn't fit me well either and found out that over-the-ear design is not for me. K550 and D600 are still pretty new purchases. I think these two complement each other well. I like all facets of sound. By purchasing these two, I have a phone for most/any situation since I listen to everything under the sun.We probably just like different stuff. No worries.Edited by AJ us580 - 7/5/13 at 11:57pm

Wow.  Quite a variety of opinions on some of these headphones!  
 
As for my own collection, I think it's best to rank them by how frequently they get used.  Obviously, this isn't perfect, but then what is? 
 
Senn HD 600
Senn HD 800
Beyer DT-48 (circa 1960)
Stax SR-Lambda
AKG 702
AKG Sextett
Yamaha YH-100
 
I've been debating buying one really high-end set of cans, but I'm not quite convinced I would get much more out of them.  Given my system, I'm not sure the headphones are always the limiting factor.  And I really like the sound from some of the older headphones....
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

holy moly that is quite the fantastic set'o'phones. it really is one of the best I've seen on my time lurking around

Not sure if you meant my phones or not.  But if so, thanks!
 
While I listen to the HD600s the most because they seem to work well with all of source and amp configurations, the Lamba, DT48 and Sextett pairs are probably the most fun to play around with.

Move over Ultrasone HFI-780, the Sony MDR-1R just took your place at #1 in my list of head of headphones.
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Based on how much I use them:
 
Sennheiser Momentum
Mr. Speakers Mad Dogs
Sennheiser 280s
 
Turns out I spend a lot more time wearing headphones while I'm walking around town than sitting at home and I don't have a portable amp to drive the Mad Dogs. The 280s were the only cans I had for a couple years, but they've taken the back seat to my more expensive purchases now that I'm not a broke college student.

But where is your AKG k314p now? I thougt those were your favorite AKGs!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I don't think of them as headphones but earbuds and tend to leave them out; I used them not ten minutes ago.
 
A recent discussion over at the Sextett thread made me realize now that my vintage K 141 don't have the Sextett-type ringing in their measurement (refer to the K 241 and K 250 graphs for examples of that). Since it's a serviced pair, I suspect the drivers were changed - they're of a grey color suggesting a later model, plus the response isn't comparable to the one seen in this old magazine (spot the hitch at 4 kHz, quite possibly reflecting huge 4 kHz ringing à la Sextett). No idea which drivers they might be.

I wonder how close the seeming treble ringing on the HE 60 is to that on the unmodded Unipolar series and whether it can be modded away in a similar way.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Do you have a graph for reference? I've been looking for CSDs on the HE60 for a while now and haven't been able to find anything more than the graphs over at InnerFidelity. I don't hear any offensiveness in the treble as in the D7000, DT 990, et al. It might have been this way on the HEV70 but I only listened with that briefly.
 
It's probably the fastest headphone I've heard. Would love to see a CSD to better understand its merits.
 
I do consider myself lucky to be able to own one.

so you would rank the D7000 under the DT880? Why is that. Is it because of D7000's lack of neutrality?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



No problem! It may just be that the HE-400 is more suited to my tastes. I've gone through a pretty large gamut of headphones over my tenure here, and the HE-400s seem pretty much spot on to what I've been looking for in a headphone. The HD800 is extremely neutral and has a massive soundstage, which may be what many are after but I sometimes find them a tad boring as a result. I really love how involved the music sounds with the HE-400 - bass has weight and authority while not being bloomy, soundstage is large but encompassing and instrument separation is always discernible. Just more dynamic and fun while not being overly coloured. Both headphones are an excellent contrast to each other but I find myself reaching a tad more for the HE-400 - so much so that I'm debating whether or not to keep the HD800 since adding the HiFiman to my stable.
I always get more immersed with what I'm listening to with the HE-400 - it's more enjoyable, while with the HD800 they're a bit too clinical that I find myself listening to the headphone rather than the actual music... If that makes sense??Edited by Steve-72 - 7/28/13 at 7:11pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I figured that ranking might be a tad controversial. You pretty much nailed it there.  Don't get me wrong, I love the D7000 (I'm actually listening to the new Daft Punk album on them right now ).  I find myself naturally gravitating towards the DT880 over the LA-D7000 since it is so close to neutral.  I've really come to appreciate the DT880, especially over the past few months.  They sound so good with just about any type of music to my ears.  They are also extremely comfortable on my head and I can wear them for several hours.  
 
These however have been recabled for balanced use with a Black Dragon V1 cable so that may have something to do with it.  I haven't heard a stock DT880 so I can't say for sure if the cable has had a substantial effect on the sound.  It definitely has plenty of thump in the bass, though, which is an area where many have said it lacks.

Thanks for getting back with that, Steve, and it makes a lot of sense. I enjoy having a range of cans for different purposes. Like you, I really enjoy the exciting and vivid presentation of music that I get from my HifiMans, but often at night, I end up reaching for my HD598s a lot, due to their supreme comfort and easy going yet detailed approach. Everything sounds slightly rounded off with them, but so smooth and inviting, which is a nice balm from the HE-400s.
Being a musician who has also spent many hours in big studios, hearing stuff played through industry standard setups and monitors, I know what a clinical and analytical approach sounds like and it doesn't always move. Still though, I do like to dig deep into recordings and hear between the lines, especially the great big orchestral stuff that I'm mostly into and I dearly hope that one day I'll be privy to hear the HD800s!
Happy listening! (Just listening to Sibelius's 6th symphony, played by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Colin Davis through my HE-400s)

The HD 600 are good for out-of-box performance, relatively speaking, though price is their issue. For a used HD 600, you can get five used pairs of Yamaha or three used pairs of Unipolar - you see the problem.
 
The DT 990 are marked modded, though the only mod on them is that I stuffed the old flattened pads with some cotton. Even with flat pads, I liked them better than the K 601 I had a week before.
 
The K 250 are very skewed in the treble response (very bright) and not as clean in decay as some of the others, so they score lower on performance. It's a Sextett-based driver and those tend to be subjectively enjoyable, still.

AKG K702 (with Anniversary pads) - Wished it had just a little more bass.  A little less bass and they would be gone.
 
Vsonic  GR07 -  Small, portable, sound great,  great sub-bass, good isolation.  What more does a growing boy need?
 
AKG K550 -  Comfy, incredible sub-bass, great isolation.
 
Beyerdynamic  DT1350 - I would rank these higher if not for the clamping force. 
 
Alessandro  MS-2 -  They sound great, but they are a pain in the ass to use.
 
Sennheiser Momentum - Fun and beautiful.  A little too much bass or they would rank higher.
 
Sony MDR-7550 -  An IEM with very little isolation.  They sound great, but if a mosquito flies by, you will hear it.

Sennheiser PX100 - Probably my favorite headphone.  I take them everywhere - they have been with me for ages and I will probably ask to be buried with them on when I kick the bucket.

T-Peos  H-100 -  Really good, but they acquired a bad rep on this site.

Sennheiser MX760 - One of the best earbuds I've heard. 
 
Apple EarPods - Not bad...not good.  They came with my iPhone 5, so I can't complain.
 
Sennheiser PX200 - I don't like them much...I gave them to my girlfriend.

Sorry. I should clarify , what I meant is that the HD598 sounds spacious but too laid-back. The HD558 was more enjoyable for me due to its more forward nature.

Wow :D so I'm not the only one who loves the sound of the DT880? I've heard HD650s and HD600s at meets and it's not really my sound although I do prefer the HD600 over the HD650 for it's neutrality. I also have modified DT880's so I don't see the bass being missing, it has a very strong impact and presence for an open can with the sparkly realistic treble. I think the fast decay and soundstage of the DT880 is what creates the illusion of space and transparency. I'm listening to Disclosure - Settle in 16bit FLAC and if any of you like house or electronic this album is a must-listen to. I get a nice club sound filling my ears :]

I would put LCD 2.2 above HE-500 if it wasn't for comfort issues.

Hi all,
 
As mentioned in another thread in the forum, I think I like better the 558 over the 598 because its sound is transmit more "emotion" to me. But the 598 are very nice headphones and I like them a lot for Jazz and movies.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


signed... sad but true. The HD598 just has more treble, which is not always a good thing.
plus, with some easy mods, the HD558's FR is almost identical to the newer HD600 with a bit more harmonic mess. (still better than most cans on the market)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I prefer IEM over headphones...so here I go.
 
IEM ranking:
1) Westone UM3X (red) ------I prefer this over W4 by hair because it gives the most isolation + fit.
2) Westone 4
3) Yamaha EPH-100
4) VSonic GR07
5) JVC HA-FXT90 -------- (Just had it. still need longer burn-in hope it gets real better like GR07)

Headphone:
1) AKG Q460
2) AKG K518 LE (Green)
3) Sony MDR-ZX600
4) Klipsch image one --------(worst headphone I had...I regret for owning it...equivalent to Beats headphone I'd say and paid full retail price before I discovered amazon)

maaaaybe? I dunno, the more I listen to it, the more I like the increased sense of openness vs the HE-500. And the HE-500 does not sound closed or congested. 
 
But I do like the heavier hitting HE-500 for some songs. But for most of the music I'm listening to now, the Lambda is coming out on top.

3. AKG K702 65th AE (on my gaming rig and on my desk for classical, jazz, and youtube)
 
I listen to music much more than I game. The AE, therefore, gets the least headtime out of all despite having the best sound quality. I like my music to sound more closed in rather than as open as the AE, except for jazz and classical. This leads to the MDs getting the most headtime and since I spend a lot of time on campus my 4R gets almost as much.

1. Koss Pro DJ 100 / TB + M50 pads
 
2. AKG Q701 - Totally smooth with nearly everything on my Micro Amp + Modi (both transparent). Sounds good with E17 DAC too.
 
3. Sennheiser HD-650 (this sounds pretty balanced, but I got a little more mid-bass with new pads and it became very slightly more muffled sounding). I use this for gaming/movies.
 
4. AKG K400 EP (see through screen, deeper pads, less treble than LP). Sounds like a more forgiving Q701 that's darker. Scored this for $69 on Amazon mint!
 
5. Sennheiser HD-598
 
6. AKG K400 LP (very trebly/thin. Not very warm at all and almost requires K601 pads)
 
7. AKG Q701 + Anniversary pads (this is 99% identical to the Anniversary or so they say) - Hate it. Seems warmer, but can't really hear much of this increased bass. Just sounds like less treble and more muffled sounding.
 
BTW the two K400s have totally different drivers. Weird huh? My K400 LP driver looks like a K500 driver!
 
I would say my least used headphone now is the HD-598. Not sure why since I like it so much.
 
The ranking is also based on how much time i've spent with each. I've purchased about a dozen DJ100s so far and most of them are gone now. Nuts! They do sound maybe 20% better with M50 pads. I don't like them as a portable.
 
Right now I'd say I use my Q701 for music 75% of the time.

1) Beyerdynamic T1 (best all-rounder, musical sound with incredible detail)
2) DIYed LA7000 (fun, more balanced sound than the LA5000. Has great detail retrieval, but can be fatiguing during long listening sessions. Beautiful wooden cups!)
3) ATH-W3000ANV (wonderful mids and detail, beautifully made)
3) Stax SR-303 (balanced and speaker-like sound)
4) Yamaha HP-1 (hidden gem at its price. Sound like a mini LCD2 and when modded can come very close to the LCD2)
5) DIYed LA5000 (fun sound with very tight and controlled bass. Can be too dark for some)
6) AKG K240 Sextett (great bass but mid bass can be too much sometimes. Probably needs recabling)
7) AKG K240 Monitor (no slouch but still takes the rear in my list)

Oh come on, we all know that the lowly Q701 is no match for Beats!

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In order of how many hours I typically use them a day:
 
1. Beyerdynamic DT770 80ohm (Use them primarily because of their comfort and build quality. No longer a fan of their sound signature.)
2. Astrotec AM-90 (Not a fan of the mids on these, but everything else is just fantastic including the $40 price tag.)
3. Meelectronics M6 (Got these because I needed a cheap pair of IEMs for the gym. They've got a surprisingly decent sound, and are great for the price.)
4. Sennheiser HD515 (Other than the lack of clarity with these, my only complaint is that I didn't wait for the build quality upgrade that was the HD518. These were significantly less comfortable than the DT770s when I bought them, and have become even less so since they snapped. Now the only thing holding them together is duct tape and it's too loose no matter what I do so they don't clamp well at all. Keep them around because they were my first significant headphone purchase.)
 
Now I'm saving up for AKG K702s which I've demoed alongside the other equally respectable flagships and absolutely fell in love with. Not sure if they'll will be my last over-the-ear headphone, but it's certainly possible.

Oh well... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Well, it's been a while since I've last posted in here. Time for an update.
 
Starting from most favorite, and working my way down from there, with an asterisk next to headphones I don't actually own at the moment, but have auditioned enough to feel like ranking anyway:
 
-1: Stax SR-Lambda
(That midrange, sense of clarity, soundstage and overall comfort...just wow. My mind was really blown when I actually got one in stock condition, well cared for and with the original drivers intact. I don't think I'll find anything that's a real upgrade from these 'til I step up into the Omega-series models. They even sound great off of SRD-series transformer boxes, if you've got a speaker amp of some kind lying around.)
-2: Sony MDR-MA900
(Has most of what I like about those Normal bias Lambdas, except it's just $150-155 and doesn't require a special amp. Treble's a bit diluted and it doesn't sound quite as clear, but I still like the basic sound signature and presentation enough to consider it my default recommendation.)
-3: that old beater of a set I once mistook for an SR-Lambda
(The drivers were rebuilt at some point; the midrange is still great, but the bass and treble are rather rolled-off compared to a real SR-Lambda still in stock condition. And while it's comfortable, the clamping force is even lower to the point that it just kind of loosely rests on my head...)
*4: HiFiMan HE-400
(With velour pads, it was surprisingly comfortable, and the weight's a non-issue. It also works well off of modestly-amped sources. But the midrange is recessed and has this raspy texture over it that I don't like at all...)
*5: Stax SR-202
(Basically an electrostatic HE-400, sound signature-wise. That means the midrange just took a huge step backward from the original 1979 Normal bias design. Comfort's better and yet worse in a number of ways. But I put it below the HE-400 just because of the amp requirement.)
*6: Audio-Technica ATH-AD700
(It's pretty much what everyone else says about it. Huge. Comfortable. Loose-fitting. Great soundstage. No bass.)
-7: Philips CitiScape Uptown
(A good music set with great comfort and isolation, but it lacks the soundstage depth needed for gaming, and that volume slider seriously sucks.)
-8: Sansui SS-20
(The sound quality's decent, but if you thought the HE-400 was heavy, you know nothing until you put one of these vintage beasts on your head! It's the comfort that really sends it near the bottom, more than anything.)
-9: Panasonic RP-HTF600
(Once burned-in, it's a very nice set for $30-36...until one of the drivers utterly craps out on you and sends that money down the drain. Quite a shame, since I'd easily put it above the AD700, possibly even higher, if reliability wasn't such a problem.)

Surprised you went with another normal bias if your amplification presumably also has a Pro bias output. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Ah, somebody with both an 1840 and an MD! A brief comparison?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Two very different headphones  - opposites really.
 
Aside from the cost and fact that one is open and one closed.
 
Build, fit and  comfort - both very solidly built.  SRH1840 lighter by quite a large margin - easier to war with glasses too.  Actual wearing comfort pretty close - MD has a more comfortable headband, but 1840 has more far more comfortable ear pads. I prefer the 1840 because of the weight difference.
 
Sound signature - 1840 is flat (but tends to a bright signature), open, airy, bass is very textured, but well extended and linear.  Extremely detailed.  MD is comparatively very, very dark.  It's detailed - and the vocals are good and clear - it's just a far more earthy than airy sound (if that makes sense).  MD has more bass presence and texture - less air and sense of space.
 
Soundstage/imaging - MD has small and intimate stage, but imaging is actually very good.  Accurate sense of placement.  Vocals / mid-range quite forward.  SRH1840 has wider stage (as it should) and is very, very clear.  Imaging is extremely good (better than MD).
 
Tonality - SRH1840 is slightly on the bright side of natural - overall quite flat/balanced though.  Lack of mid-bass hump (compared to HD600) is quite pleasant.  MD is definitely on the darker side of natural (quite a bit) - and although both are reasonablty 'neutral' cans - IMO the 1840 is closer to natural instrument tone.
 
My preference (for now) very much for the 1840.  I bought the MD to see what the fuss is about.  Very different to what I am used to, and will take considerable time to acclimatise.  I am hoping to get a listen to the Alpha Dogs at some stage to see if the sound is closer to what I'm after.  I'm not sure f the MD will be a keeper for me.  And if this is what somewhat like the LCD2 is voiced - at least I'll know that can is not for me.
 
Sorry for the complete O-T.  Please resume normal headphone ranking

Been far too long since I added to this, and a recent headphone has really turned the tables.
 
 
Top five: All of these see regular usage and eartime.
 
1: NAD RP18 Mylar (Fostex T50v1 OEM): Absolutely incredible, these are so far ahead of my other headphones that it's not even funny. Lightning fast attack and excellent decay. Totally flat response from 20-1000Hz with a bit of dropoff in the treble. Wonderful treble and bass extension, and extremely clean sound throughout the whole spectrum. Astonishing detail retrieval and control, and extremely precise imaging. Sounds like a wall of sound with the stock pads, however. Somewhat heavy, very thin supra-aural earpads, and a high level of clamping force. As expected, not very comfortable. Difficult to drive, but not restrictively so. Responds well to pad-rolling. Very pretty design.
 
2: Audio Technica ATH-8 (Signet TK33): Very nice-sounding cans. Extremely flat response with excellent treble extension. Warm, but a bit bright. Electrostatic attack speed and imaging, and likewise very low distortion. Nice little intimate soundstage. Featherlight design, suspension headband, and very soft velour earpads make these the most comfortable cans I've ever worn. This also makes them a bit flimsy build-wise, but still better than most modern cans. A bit lacking in the bass department since they're stats. Somewhat sloppy decay, oddly enough, and a bit lacking in micro-detail. Very difficult to power, requires (good) speaker taps to get good volume levels without clipping. They are currently being woefully underpowered, so take this evaluation of them with a grain of salt.
 
3: KOSS Pro/4AAA (heavily modded): Great all-rounders. Very smooth sound with downright excellent bass. Very bassy, but never dark or veiled. Does extremely well on bass-heavy music but still manages to make other genres very listenable. What little it lacks in upper treble extension it makes up for with speed and impact. Great soundstage, good imaging. Gets very slightly congested on complex passages, but no more than an HD600 does. Huge and heavy, somewhat unweildly, kind of uncomfortable. Somewhat difficult to drive. Absolute ******* tanks, these could get run over by a car and survive.
 
4: Pioneer SE-500 (modded): Remarkably stat-like. Sparkly, extended treble without splash, grain, or distortion. Absolute smoothest sounding headphone I've ever heard. Very lush and "wet" sounding, as opposed to the somewhat dry sound of the TK33. Chameleon soundstage with good (if somewhat diffuse) imaging. Stupidly difficult to drive and no bass to speak of whatsoever, yet somehow very listenable. Comfort is decent, build is good.
 
5: Sony DR-Z5: Downright excellent portables. Good attack speed and excellent decay. Ruthlessly analytical and revealing. Very flat sound, good bass extension, decent slam. Excellent isolation and no sound leakage. Very, VERY comfortable despite the weight and clamping force. Decently stable, but not good for active uses like jogging. Fold almost completely flat and are very easy to wear around the neck. Fairly high distortion in comparison to the others. Absolutely lacks treble, unfortunately, else these would rank much higher.
 
 
The rest: These rarely get used anymore, and thus have more brief descriptions.
 
6: Pioneer SE-700: Very flat and smooth response, no peaks or resonances or anything of the sort. Extremely low distortion. Unfortunately, even more difficult to power than the SE-500 and somewhat lacks speed and control. I know I still haven't heard these at their best, and unfortunately I might not ever, since the drivers are fragile and easily overvolted. These are one of the sexiest-looking headphones ever made.
 
7: "Pioneer SE-700RP" (T50RP drivers in an SE-700 shell): Pretty good, definitely a far better implementation than the stock T50RP shell. Flat sound with a slight tilt to bright. Fast attack, good decay, decent soundstage. High distortion is what kills these.
 
8: Stanton Dynaphase Sixty (modded): Extremely good bass and massive soundstage. A little muddy treble, probably needs new crossovers. Lacks control, gets congested on fast content. Decent speed despite the 2-way design. Double the weight and size of the LCD-2 (no, I'm not exhaggerating) but surprisingly comfortable. 
 
9: Beyerdynamic DT1350: Good portables. Lacking in attack speed, good decay and control. Sounds very closed in. No soundstage is better than a closed in soundstage. Good treble and bass extension. Decent slam. What ruins these is a terrible haze in the midrange caused by the cup reflections. 
 
10: Sansui SS-20: Another 2-way design. Very good detail retrieval, better than the Sixty and definitely uncharacteristic of the time period. Good soundstage. Sansui made some nice stuff. However, there's a pretty nasty resonance in the midrange that really just seems to ruin it for me.
 
11: Numark HV-215v: Decent headphones. These are a retro-DJ style can from the early '90s. As expected, lots of bass emphasis and shelved treble. Honky midsection and overcooked bass. Intriguing driver design. Surprisingly comfortable. Built like a tank.
 
12: Bang & Olufsen U70: Real stinkers. Sounds like a middier 4AAA with less detail and without any sort of bass slam. Very lacking in speed for an orthodynamic. Not all that comfortable. Very neat design and quite pretty. More of a display piece that just so happens to make noise. 
 
13: KOSS K/6x Plus: My first headphones ever. Good detail, good treble and bass extension, but kind of muffled sounding. Infamous tin-can veiling so common in headphones from the '80s. Decent comfort and the famous tank-like KOSS build. Still somewhat listenable now.
 
14: Audio-Technica ATH-M50: Not so crazy about these anymore. Nasty sounding highs and a complete lack of control throughout the spectrum. Very farty bass without true extension. Closed-in sounding. Good build, but not great. My first "audiophile-grade" headphones.
 
15: Fostex T50RP (stock): Okay, so I technically don't still own a stock T50RP, but I do remember what they sound like. Even more middy sound than any of the others, and an incredibly muffled, veiled, distorty sound. Not very comfortable either. Really bad. 
 
16: Audatron SH-608R: Nothing will ever top this, in stock form or modded. A Wal-Mart clone of the Numark HV-215v mentioned earlier. I used to like these quite a bit; I don't know what the hell was wrong with my ears back then. Worse build and FAR worse sound than the 215s. High distortion, overcooked bass, no treble, no soundstage, and uncomfortable as sin. No redeeming qualities whatsoever.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I have a few good reasons for that:
 
-I wanted to be sure that the "SR-Lambda" I had, with the mineral wool removed, the rebuilt drivers, and a 5-pin Pro bias cable for whatever reason, was indicative of a real SR-Lambda in stock condition. It turned out not to be, not by a long shot. These last two years left me kinda deceived, actually.
-Word is that the original SR-Lambda has the best midrange reproduction of the entire Lambda line. I don't want anything getting in the way of my vocals.
-I didn't like the Nova/numerical arc due to significantly higher clamping force, but it actually turns out that a vintage arc in good condition clamps almost as much, and my first set is just unusually loose in that regard. For this reason, I may start looking into the Lambda Nova Signature once more, provided that I can find a set for sale.
 

 
I thought nobody else on the entirety of Head-Fi owned a set!
 
The sound quality seemed decent enough, with unusually good soundstage for a closed set, but the sheer weight and shallow earpads ultimately detract from comfort too much for my tastes. It doesn't help that the original pads on my set were pretty much ruined from old age, so I improvised and barely fit the pads I salvaged from my Panasonic RP-HTF600 (which I would still be using if not for the driver failure).
 
Part of the reason I actually started shopping around for Head-Fi-worthy headphones was to find out how much better modern sets might have it over the SS-20...or equally vintage sets, in the case of my Stax equipment.

Although I only ACTUALLY still have the XPT100s and (disasembled) HD650s, however tomorrow I'm going to have the Westone 4Rs.  Getting back in the game a little, heh.
 
XPT100 was honestly the most worthy headphone I've ever had.  It's great with the biggest variety of music, unfatiguing, musical, and to me pretty neutral.  For only $100.  Definitely more versatile (sonically) than any of my other headphones.  Honestly I think they might be better than the Grados.  Much less fatiguing, pretty decent at Grado's rock/metal game, WHILE being able to excel in many other forms of music
 
I lied to myself for a while and told myself I liked the M100s, but honestly they just had too much bass for my liking.  
 
The Westone 4Rs are pretty impressive.  Much more versatile, and less congested than the Shure 530s.  Not to mention the fit is far superior.  The default silicon inserts just seem to fit better (and of course the foam inserts are great as well).  The plastic wire holder seems to be the biggest reason for such a great fit

Still fairly new to audiophile quality headphone appreciation.
Lived with and loved my Shure's for many years before moving into an apartment and feeling the need to move away from speakers.
 
It now seems to be an addiction , as I want more without being able to justify it. ;)
 
Owned and operated a mobile disco business for a few years, so need to resist the temptation to only play "doof, doof" music now.
As we call it in Aussie land.
 
Here is my list. (first post on Head-Fi)
 
01. Alessandro MS-Pro
 
03. Q-701
09. K-601
 
02. HD-650
06. Momentum
07. Amperior
10. RS-220
11. RS-180
 
08. Yamaha Pro500
 
05. Beyer DT-990 Premium
 
04. Shure E4.
 
Thinking about adding:
HE-500
LCD-2
HD-800
HD-600
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

For me, No 1 by a long way are my HD800's.  After that the list moves around a bit depending on mood / source / music etc, but I am getting more and more impressed with my Shure 1840's - these headphones are very good at everything; brilliant at not a lot. and poor is not a word you would use in any context - a real mid / hi level contender.
 
After that I go:
 
HiFiMan HE-500
Sennheiser Amperior
HD650's
AT ATH-W1000 Grandioso
 
But context matters.  The Amperiors feature high on the list because they are my main portables.
 
Cheers,

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
They came with an SRD-7/SB, which only has Normal bias outputs. In light of that, I don't think the prior owner would have ever plugged it into a Pro bias output.
 
I'm also thinking that whoever rebuilt the drivers would have had the sense to not plug it into a Pro bias output by accident.
 
Still, the drivers must have been quite deteriorated if they needed a rebuild in the first place.

I preferred the T1 to the HD 800 personally. I slightly preferred the R10 to the Orpheus when I heard them. I think a lot has to do with the system the headphones are hooked up to. I don't think he's being serious with the post.

Sony MDR-V6 w EDT 231V - Still, nothing has come close to touching it.  Missing amplitude in the treble which will scare most away, (it is there, but like a bass guitar in a rock song, it acts as subtle backing) but cleanliness and accuracy throughout the rest of the range with excellent soundstage, holographic imaging, wonderful tonality, and a special tactility on good recordings pushes it far beyond everything else I've heard.  Not at all perfect, but a hell of a lot closer than the rest.  I'm hoping the TH900 will be the "perfect" version of these.
 
2. NAD RP18 - More enjoyable overall than the HD600 was, so it makes the list.
 
Honorable Mention: HD600 - Unnatural, dry tonality.  Overall better than everything that isn't on the list, but not good enough to make it on the main list.
 
 
Ended up deciding that nothing else warrants a ranking.

Personal preferences are personal lol I would disagree and swap the Senns and the AT's and  the LCD3 and the Stax... but again that's my personal opinion.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Sennheiser HD 449
2) Sennheiser HD 598
Reason being is that the 449s sound exactly the same as the 598s, while being over $160 cheaper. The 598s are just more comfortable to wear, that's about it.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have doubts that an open headphone sounds anything like a closed headphone with a completely different driver and housing.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

okay so it seems I'm having mood swings, because one day, I LOVE MY X10's then the next day I'm all like meh, but today, I'm flipping out at how amazing they are,except for their tiny soundstage and their uncomfortability, otherwise they are phenomenal.
1. Akg Sextetts: unfortunately these aren't getting any head time as they are being prepared for operation "Super Sexytetts"
2. Denon Hp700: Holy Fizz do these sound super awesome, now that I've given my ears a taste of Mid to Hi-fi, they seem to sound supremely natural and neutral, also the velour earpads broke in making them way more comfy
3. Klipsch X10: ER MAH GERD IMAGING IN DAT BASS, AND MIDS! the only place they lose out on is soundstage, and comfort.
4. Audio Technica ws99: very soft leather pads and great hiphop cans make these great for trips, or for showing people the light because of their surprising capabilities
5. Koss Ksc-75: really nice and surprisingly not muddy in comparison to my hd 439
6. Hd 439: oh how the great have fallen, these used to be my favourites/comfies/basshead can but the bass has become unbearable now as I'm starting to realize my true love for cold and analitical cans (the k701 and hd 800 make me wanna... let's not talk about it)
?. Beyer dt250-250: I wonder how they will sound?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
you find x10 to be uncomfortable?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The X10 is the most comfortable IEM I've ever used... Also, I quite enjoy the soundstage on mine. Maybe its my amp?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
X10 are indeed one of the most comfortable iems I've tried, along with MDR 7550. But I see how it might slip out of ear easily.

2. Superlux HD668B (Haven't listened to these for a long time so can't remember how they sound)
3. Beyerdynamic DT100 (Strange sound, a bit colored next to DT48, but has alot of potential. Haven't listened to these with proper pads yet, since mine are broken and leaking)

Just curious how do you like the modded Grado Sr80 compared in just sound quality? I am going to be working on custom SR60 with what looks like very similar mods. I just do not  know how it will compare to other headphones
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


If it was overall sound quality, it would probably sit in 5th place after the same headphones from 1-4 shuffle a little.
 
I punched 4 holes per driver and the earpads I made cover up the outer ring of holes on the baffle which seems to tame the treble shrillness and control some of the 'bass boom' from punching driver holes - making it a much more versatile headphone and more enjoyable experience.

This has now changed to (with 2 new additions) -

Joint 2nd - Koss Sportapro on KSC75 clips/Grado SR80 (modded)
3rd - AKG K240 DF (would be near the top if they had more bass presence)
4th - Koss KSC75 on Sportapro headband
5th - Koss Portapro
6th - Beyerdynamic DT231 Pro
7th - KRK KNS-8400
8th - JVC HA-S400 (modded)
I don't understand why the Yamahas don't get more attention, they are shockingly good headphones, regardless of price. I'm struggling to fault them at all, except maybe a tad small soundstage and very slightly bass heavy, which is something many people want in a portable and quite surprising for an open backed headphone (surprising in a good way for most people).Edited by amigomatt - 10/3/13 at 12:54pm 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I'd hazard a guess based on his profile image and his signature that they're Genelec, though everything in their range looks too similar for me to pinpoint a model.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
What kind of potential do they have? I personally found them quite bad and even Golden Ears rank them pretty low. Tried some mods and then trashed them.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I remember I digged them with acoustic guitars, Rodrigo y Gabriela for example.. Guitars had a nice body. Dunno.. Haven't listened to them for a while really, and never got to listen properly because I need new pads for them. Never would use them as main cans though. They are just refreshing to listen to once in a while if you know what I mean.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

IMO the DT100 sounds a lot like the K240DF, that is with good sealing pads and foam inserted (on the drivers).
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hmm aren't the old K240DF actually pretty decent headphones? At least my K240M 600ohm were. I can't say that the DT100 would have sounded anything like the K240M though. Maybe with properly sealing pads, maybe?
 
EDIT: By the way, I paid 15€ for my pair of DT100's. They are 20years old I think. So that's probably something I forgot to say xD
Edited by Headzone - 10/4/13 at 5:59am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My DF sound nothing like the DT 100 (5 €). The DT 100 are kinda like the K 160, though.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The problem with buying the DT100 cheap, is that most of the time the foam pieces and earpads are detoriated.
With new pads and foam pieces installed, they have the same speed, clarity, tight bass and overall cohesiveness in sound as the K240 DF.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

That sounds quite promising. Aren't they quite analytical sounding? Makes me want to buy new earpads for my pair to try out. 
 
I would like to know how old my DT100's actually are, they had some white velours on them when I got them.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I didn't found them analytical sounding. In fact I was really surprised at the enjoyment of their rather toe tapping sound. I had the 400 ohm version, and a tube amp to power them. I did like them.
With new earpads, you will also get the foam inserts.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
No problem with pads on my pair. They look quite minty on the Golden Ears sample as well: http://en.goldenears.net/index.php?mid=GR_Headphones&m=0&page=13&document_srl=8233. I think you may actually have something other than the DT 100 in your DT 100.

Funny you mention this. I looked up an old K160 thread, and found this:
 
"got them today. very hard to drive and very much a vintage monitor type. sound is very detailed, lighter on the bass end. very merciless. much like an akg 240df or a vintage beyer monitor"
http://www.head-fi.org/t/415346/help-with-history-of-akg-k160#post_6272910
 
Indeed, just like the DT100.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I didn't get that guy back then either, as the K 160 sounded quite meager to me overall. (Note that he was later selling his K 160 on HF.) Certainly something to own for the cool oldschool AKG logo rather than sound quality. They were apparently made for talkie radio work, hence a huge freq response hump in the mids like on the DT 100.
 
You'll find me in that thread comparing the K 160 to the vintage DT 990 - the K 160 got absolutely handed.

1. LCD-2 Bamboo
My favourite listening experience, for home use only.
2. Ultrasone Signature Pro
Relatively new to me, came highly recommended. For portable use.
3. ACS T1 CIEM
Brilliant for commuting, near total isolation and zero leakage, but fiddly to use and mine haven't been that reliable.
4.Bose AE2w Bluetooth
I was really surprised at how much I liked these. I find them very convenient when I'm switching between phone calls and music or for use with my laptop.
 
These are my regulars though I think I'll retire the T1s if the Sig Pros continue to impress. I have back up headphones in case of audio emergencies (Beyerdynamic T50P, AKG K490 NC and Shure 535 in that order) because I just couldn't face commuting without music.

1. Shure SE535 (modded with acoustic filters for more treble)
2. Grado SR125i

Before the mod the SE535 was my least favourite headphone, and the HD598 the most favourite. After the mod the SE535 sounded much more clear and detailed. Then, when I went back to the HD598, suddenly it sounded dull and veiled. Go figure.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

 Sony V6 - only use them for turntable setup
 
 DT990pro - Need a good amp to shine. Otherwise, they sound distant with a bloated low-end and recessed (albeit somewhat peaky) highs. They also have an uncanny (bad pun intended) way of extending the soundstage to the point where I sometimes remove the cans to make sure the speakers aren't playing.
 
 DT880/600 - clear, well-balanced tonal balance, an incisive perspective, relatively detailed and very comfortable over a longer term.

^ Lugbug, make me want to buy hd600. How do you find detail retrieval hd650 vs 600? (apart from the frequency signature) I always tempted to buy 600 but I find 650 have a bit more detail. 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I honestly think it depends on how they are amped... I know its a cliche, but the more power they get, the more they open up and with that the more control and resolution. I don't own the 650's any more so I wouldn't like to say which one has the best retrieval of details without side by side examining.  
 
The HD600's are more balanced however, and do have a brighter lit treble so details ime are more prominent in that respect. I like both, but the 600's are more amp friendly because of the balance. They also have the best tonality I've heard below the HD800. 
 
They won't 'wow' you, but they'll grow on you like a very reliable friend :) 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yeah, that I think what I hear at Senn demo station as well. Like more on stage vs listening from smokey pub with a nice plush sofa (hd650), which also not bad. I will be using it for movie, maybe might as well I get one and try. Thanks.

Ety HF5 - great sound, but not as comfortable as above
Sony V6 - very good all around!  Top 2 beats in sound though...
Beyer 990 - great comfort, but their coloration sometimes hurt them... (and me)
Grado SR80 - Great! Almost tops 990s, but 300$ vs 100$, can't blame 300$ for sounding a bit better...

I have a new addition to my headphone stable
 
1.) AKG K612 Pro
2.) AKG K240 MKII
3.) Sony MDR-MA900
4.) Sennheiser PX-100 ii
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Alrighty then... here's my updated list.
 
First, The Fantastic Four:
 
1: Sony DR-Z6: Oh sweet lord. The only thing I can think of to say is "perfect". Nothing beats this headphone... period.
 
2: NAD RP18 (Mylar version)(Fostex T50v1 OEM): I can see why people are crazy about these. Very well detailed and excellent sounding orthodynamics, but fall short of the #1 place for a couple reasons. The bass is there but is lacking real oomph and power, and there is this ear-raping effect on the upper midsection and treble regions that sounds quite harsh and aggressive. This is due to the headphone's abnormally high distortion figures in those regions, which are to be expected since these headphones were pushing the absolute limit of what the tech could do at the time; these measure hauntingly similar to the modern-production Audez'e LCD-2 and 3.
 
3: "Pioneer SE-700RP", a modded Pioneer SE-700: T50RP drivers in an SE-700 shell which has been converted to over-ear. Fully open implementation with minimal damping. Extremely bright and crisp sounding headphones with one of the best soundstage presentations I have ever heard, even when compared to headphones like the HD800. Laser-etched imaging, excellent depth and width. Perfect timbre for every instrument, classical is handled masterfully. Sounds similar to the Sony MDR-SA5000, but warmer and better in every area -- even speed. Consequentially, they are a bit thin and bassless, so are very much a genre-specific headphone.
 
4: Pioneer SE-500 (modded): Why... why do I still love this headphone? It's bright and bassless, no real soundstage, messed up imaging, kind of lacking upper treble, stupid hard to drive, uncomfortable... and yet it's liquidy smooth and flat, with a delightful snap to the lower treble, and vocals that are so seductive that I can still just lose myself in it. A one sentence summation would be as follows: "the piezoelectric version of an orthodynamic, with electrostatic treble, and the impact of a dynamic."
 
 
And... the rest. These rarely get eartime anymore.
 
5: Sony DR-S7: More of a "Holy absolute SHᴉT, Sony" than anything, but very technically capable headphones with a good if somewhat small soundstage. The best 2-way design I've heard yet, the woofer and tweeter seem to mesh perfectly somehow. Somewhat middy but surprisingly listenable. Incredibly rare, holding on to these for the collector's value.
 
6: Pioneer SE-700 (restored): Kind of like the SE-500, but not. More like an orthodynamic with more bass and far less treble. Stupid smooth response and low distortion, but kind of lifeless. Not comfortable. Drop dead sexy. HE-6 levels of insensitive. Fragile drivers.
 
7: KOSS PRO/4AAA (extremely heavily modified): I have torn this headphone apart thousands of times, but the bottom line is this is a nice sounding headphone with an insane amount of bass and raw impact. High end is kind of tizzy and uncontrolled. Soundstage is excellent. Good transients, but lacking microdetail. Think the HD600, then give it bass and isolation.
 
8: Stanton Dynaphase Sixty (modded): Bassy headphones with a massive soundstage. Kind of sloppy. Massive and heavy. Gorgeous, if somewhat goofy looking on the head.
 
9: Sony DR-Z5: I'm sorry, but after the Z6 these are just a gross bastardization of the other two DR-Z headphones. Lacks bass and treble almost completely and is INCREDIBLY loose and smeary up top. Lightweight, durable, and pretty. 
 
10: Beyerdynamic DT1350: I'm sorry, but I just don't see why these are good. What bass is there is thin and loose, the treble is shrieky and hissy, the sound is very closed in, and they lack good attack speed. They also sound worse at low volumes, so while the isolation is great and the fit is extremely stable, they're still not good portables in my opinion.
 
11: Audio-Technica ATH-M50: I hate these headphones now. The treble is harsh, strident, and hissy. The bass is loose and steeply rolled off. The attack speed is lacking and the sound is very smeary and incoherent. Whoever said these were good was pretty damn stupid if you ask me.
 
12: KOSS K/6A: Oh my god, if you ever feel like your upgrades are insignificant, try this glorious monstrosity. Typical 60's sound: stupid middy, thin, boxy bass, harshly bright and bloomy midsection, horrible transients, no imaging or soundstage to speak of whatsoever, and mediocre comfort. Completely unlistenable. Built pretty well though and larger than most cans, so they're a good transplant headphone.
 
 
Honorable mentions: For one reason or another I can no longer listen to these, be it disrepair or misplacement.
 
Audio-Technica Signet TK33: Very nice sounding back-electret headphones. Very stat-like. Warm and intimiate with good imaging and very nice soundstaging. Drivable from any speaker amp. Currently in need of earpads, but even without them is extremely comfortable.
 
KOSS K/6x Plus: My very first headphones. Got from a garage sale for $5 ages ago. Featherlight with INSANELY good durability. Not very comfy. Sound is pretty nice actually, a bit thin with decent transients and good bass and treble. However, the shape of the housing causes an incessent "sound-coming-out-of-a-tin-can" effect that really ruins these for me nowadays. Keep them cuz I love them.
 
AKG K240 Studio: Generic, poor-sounding loudness headphones. A disgrace to the AKG name. Torn apart for modding parts ages ago. Given as a graduation gift, so I keep them.

1. Sennheiser HD-800. Because of their superior soundstage, imaging, neutrality and detail. Mainly used with O2+E-DAC and Aune T1 with Gold Lion e88cc.
2. Beyerdynamic T5p. Best closed cans I've heard (better than Ultrasone ed 8, imo). Great detail, clarity and imaging. A little darkish. Use them as my portable setup with Fiio E17, or sometimes with a CmoyBB with the AD8066ARZ op-amp, through the dock of a iPod Touch with FLAC-player.
3. Sennheiser Amperior. More portable than the T5p and not as fragile. Use them with my iPhone and with Spotify. Warmish, punchy, good resolution.
4. AKG K 701. Neutral, good soundstage but I never use them anymore. The HD-800 beats them in every aspect.
5. AKG K 450. Neutralish, portable, better than my first cans – Koss Porta Pro, but not much else. Never use them since I got the Amperior.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I currently own the HD650s which I got through a trade for the HE-400s which I loved, but really wanted to try the Sennheisers.
 
I intend to eventually get the HE-500s but since I am not financially well off, doing so would require me selling the HD650s. So, how do the two compare? (Or three, if you've tried the HE-400s as well)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Koss Pro DJ 100 w/M50 pads (has my perfect sound signature. K712 Pro is pretty close, DJ100 with M50 pads has less treble and more low bass presence. Fuller, but less forward low mids. DJ100 sounds clearer and more detailed too with a transparent setup)
2. AKG Q701 modded (K712 would go here too once I can afford to buy one. I listened to it for a long time)
3. Sennheiser HD-650 (I really like this for gaming/movies but now with my modded Q701 it rarely gets used)
4. Sennheiser HD-598 - I always have liked how this sounds. Wish it sounded a bit clearer. It's one smooth sounding headphone to my ears.
5. AKG K400 EP (stock pads)
6. AKG K400 LP (Q701 pads)

The East German wonder climbed to a deserved second place after mods. The unipolar maintains first over the HOK thanks largely to its out-of-world soundstage. The Stax are Stax and the modded Yamaha are tied with them. The rest are your average headphones, some better and some worse; excepting the ATH-2, which may get more attention in the future.

The HOK sell often enough and usually for about $10 or less. They're not recommended unless you're really into modding headphones, hence the price.

3. Monster Miles Davis Trumpet
4. Philips SHE3580/LG Quadbeat 2
5. Sennheiser CX 890i

That's all I have. Delta's are the budget busters. Detail and life, with quite a bit of bass. The Delta's sounds QUITE A BIT like my MMDT's, but $200.00 cheaper. UE 700 lack bass punch and depth, but I love their resolution, detail retrieval, and fit. MMDT too much bass, and not enough top end, but good overall and pretty. Sennheiser's and JVC FX 40's share a similar high end sparkle that borders on fatiguing. 3580's and LG Q2's would definitely be the budget champs if not for the dry/dark/grainy mids, but so very close.

After selling 95% of all my IEMS/OEMS...these are what I have left, and ranking according to my favorite sound sigs :
 
EDIT : Just got some Comply T-200 Olive tips and put them on each of my IEM's, and this has influenced my original order. 
 
1. Ultimate Ears 700
2. Monster Miles Davis Trumpet
3. JVC HAFX 40
4. Philips SHE3580
5. Brainwavz Delta
6. JVC HAFX 30
 
Since the Comply tips, the Delta's sound was the most affected in a negative way. The lushness was gone, and the sound became more laid back, with the bass still being too thick boomy. No more do the sound like my MMDT's. My UE 700 really opened up, adding punchy bass to their resolution, detail retrieval, and fit. They easily jumped to the top of the pack. The MMDT don't have comply tips, so they remain a tad too bassy, and the highs are still too laid back, but still good overall and pretty. The JVC FX 40's changed the most for the better! Gone is that excruciating top end "smack" and unruliness in the treble that made them so disappointing. They've become very smooth and detailed with these tips. while retaining a deep rounded bass. They jump all but the UE 700's and the MMDT. The 3580's really got a bit more transparent, but lost a tad bit of the top end sparkle I liked. They tamed up a bit, but the bass is still controlled and deep, so they move just above the Delta's ever so slightly. The JVC 30's are complete crap on a wire. Useless ****. 
 
*** Just purchased the TDK IE800 dual dynamic drivers, after selling my Sennheiser CX 890i's and my Quadbeat 2's. Order could change very soon.

Can you recommend me a headphone equal or better than sr80i except for ms1 because they're not available in my country. I'm not pulling the trigger on Grado sr80i yet because I'm concerned about it's versatility, and I enjoy a lot of music genre except rap and R&B. Unless someone would tell me it's versatile enough for other genres other than rock and metal.  Max $100, preferably doesn't need an amp unless it will not go over my budget too much and not bass oriented. And is L-cush pad really a must for sr80i? Thanks.

The 880's and 240's are from memory. I do not own them at this time.
The 668's and KSC75's are what I listen to the most, swapping out the CAL! and perhaps one of the IEMS. The Sony sound very good with a home amp setup. When traveling I use the 750's or UE500. The ES18 are good, but not up to the level of the other IEMs and they feel 'hard' when inserted.
For the price it's the 750's or KSC75's, hands down. 41RMB, $7 USD including shipping. The Koss' are 3X the price here. $30, not $9 as you would pay in North America.
For $9, they are a must purchase. Just add them to your line.

Wow! Ok, considering that you haven't heard them in over 27 years, their ranking for you is quite impressive! You should try them again with potentially better sources. I got mine only a few months ago (thanks Nick!), and I can't believe how nice they sound.

Something I want to do. Get some classic 880's (although they are still made more or less), the AKG 240DF, 240 Sextett and 280's.
I miss them, but I really did destroy them not just wear out the pads but cook the drivers, break wires, everything just fell apart. Dj work, eh.
The Sextett's were very clear and clean with great soundstage and detail retreival, but a bit of sizzle. That could, however, have been due to abuse and excessive volumes. Or my 1978 receiver.
The 880's had a slightly darker sound, more bass. Beyers, no surprise.
The KSC's have such a clean, detailed, clear, upper mid and treble - but without Ssssibilants, fatigue or sizzle like the SuperLux get after foam mods.
Definitely better than I recall the Sextetts, and I am even listening to the same music, even if sourced from a file rather than cassette, 8-track, or lp.Edited by marone - 11/17/13 at 4:45am

well no sh!t, Sherlock. I'm sure there's many other headphones better than the HD380's, but for the MONEY they are excellent, fun, and smooth. I'm fairly sire the T1's, HD800, any Stax, or HiFiMan HE series headphones are better, but so is the price tag. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Most Sextetts can be had for <$100. A Sony MDR-V6/7506 with Beyerdynamic EDT-231v pads (also $100) can stand up to headphones in the $300 range and are a hell of a lot more "fun" than the HD380 Pro. Hell I'd even recommend a stock T50RP before I'd recommend the HD380. Both it and the 280 Pro sounded really muffled and bloaty, especially on the low end. They lacked refinement and detailed is definitely NOT a word I'd use to describe them.
 
They were mediocre at best, Watson.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


to your ears. They were nowhere near bloaty, muffled, or bassy to me. They were fun, had nice treble extension and yes they had good bass, and decent soundstage. Not the best but again, you speak as if you're gonna get some GRAND soundstage from $100.00 headphones. Most of the time, it's not going to happen, Moriarty. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'd kinda agree... I also found the HD280/380 to be muffled/veiled/overly smooth to the point of smothering detail... Maybe not so much muddy (they might be on the verge of qualifying as muddy) However if someone were a bass head or treble sensitive they may really enjoy these cans... for similar money I'd recommend the m80/lp2 or DT770 (if you're basshead) the Grado SR80i/225i (if you like somewhat bright, in your face rock, with super tight bass or acoustic music) the MDR-V6,  (for a more neutral take on things) the AD700x (for female vocals and stringed instruments/acoustic/folk) ... really its up to what you like... if your happy with what you have just enjoy it!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


That's what I originally said. They have a smooth sound with treble extension and bass depth with average to small soundstage. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Actually the V6/EDT combo has an insane chameleon soundstage, but that's not my point. They had decent bass, and bad everything else. Poorly extended and lacking refinement. There were a lot of resonances up top that mucked up the perceived clarity and cleanliness and the FR is simply wrong. I'd take my M50's over a 380 Pro, and I hate that headphone.
 
Yeah, to my ears, which are obviously more conditioned than yours. Sennheiser's low end stuff is downright atrocious.

When did this thread turn into "Rank the Headphones that OTHERS Own" ?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I thought this thread was "Rank the headphones you own" not earbuds.
 
I doubt many people here own more than 7 flagships unless they have stacks of cash lying around.
 
So I'm doing a rank the headphones I've tried/own
 
1. Stax SR-009 Neutral sound, deep bass, air, soundstage.  everything you could wish for but don't have the money to buy
2. Audeze LCD-3/LCD-X(I need to try them both again and A/B  but it came to a tie)
3. HD800 - I heard two setups. One I liked, the other was way too bright and sounded worse than my Beyers
4. Mr. Speakers Alpha Dogs - I really enjoyed these cans and for a closed pair they're outstanding for the price
5. Hifiman HE-500 - I really enjoyed these especially the impact they gave to the music and dynamics are very realistic. Haven't tried an HE-6
6. Beyerdynamic DT880 600 ohm - The king for the price you pay

Thanks for your opinion but this thread is about how we rank our own headphones and I stand by what I wrote. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


come on, he's only stating his opinion, not trying to change yours. That's what's interesting about this thread. 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Once upon a time, this thread was a fascinating collection of lists that nobody questioned. 
It was a unique insight into peoples preferences, unique way of hearing and untainted wild opinion.
There was the occasional 'chinking' of beer-mugs, and sometimes a cry of blasphemy, which for the most part was acceptable. 
 
I've got nothing against debate and counter opinions, but they simply belong in other threads. 
As soon as people start stating their opinions they don't stop. Headfi is largely turning into an "opinion-size measuring contest", and I don't want that to happen to this thread.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Great point.
Nobody usually mentions what they use them with either, because this particular thread is simply supposed to focus on personal headphone preference as a headphone apart from mention of any sources.
There's plenty of other threads for technical battles.
And all technical measurement crap aside, I maybe won't like what you like, and you won't like what i like. Actually I can pretty much guarantee that.
 Stating the obvious here, obviously.
this is a great thread.

I completely agree. I mentioned my CX215's in an earlier post, and I got people giving me grief about wasting my time with the CX215's. I happen to love the lower end Sennheiser sound. I used the CX300 II as my go to IEM for 2 years, and when they broke, I was heartbroken. Eventually I graduated to the Soul SL49, then the UE TF 10, but just because I'm not listening to my music through HD800's or T1's or GR07's (I owned them and hated the sound sig and fit) or Heir Audio 5's, then I'm less refined or some Neanderthal. This is about sharing what audio equipment makes us happy to share, or in some cases not so happy to share. The criticism is lame. Leave that for other blog sites. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Why is the 700 so high and FXT90 so low? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The 700's, since I replaced the stock silicone tips with Comply olives, opened up with far more controlled highs, and gave the lows a nice rounded boost. Couple that with the dual knowles TWFK drivers provide a sweet, smooth, crystal clear sound signature that's perfect for metal, classic rock, rock, and pop music. The JVC's, which offer a FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE sound, can be a bit THICK noted in the mids, and though I love the detail retrieval and fun factor of the FXT90's, the 700's are just smoother and clearer, as are the IE800's. The 800's fitted with comply's are smooth as butter, and the details shine! I fit those CX215's with comply's before I sold them to you, and they really took off soundwise with them on. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Because this isn't just about full sized headphones. Go back to the beginning of this thread, and full size have been posted alongside IEM's from the start. Though it's a little rude to question my post, when the posts beforehand are about keeping negativity out of this thread, you are forgiven, and I ask you, what are your best IEMs? As far as full sized, I personally like my Sanyo E 333's. OLD AS HELL!! But I got them on ebay because back in the day, my cousin had a pair and we'd listen to Dio and Scorpions records from his Marantz with those Sanyo headhones. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'm actually putting my JVC FXT90's up for sale on ebay. i think between my Sony XBA-30's and my TDK IE800, I'm just not gonna use the JVC's, and they are too good to really just collect dust.

 Comfort is a big part of why it was ahead.  With artist to artist it goes in favor of one or the other.  To me the hd650's won some of my favorite artist so that is why it is number 1).  I am currently saving up for some hd800's but I wont get them till the summer.

I found the soundstage to be a little wider with the HD650, and the midrange just barely pulled ahead of the LCD2. Ignoring the price, I'm surprised how similar they sound when you aren't listening critically.

I had cans like HE-400,T1 or SRH940 and I'am kind of basshead so if someone says HD700 is bass light than I just don't get it.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Pretty much everything on your list is bassier than the HD700, but you could probably bring it up with a little EQ.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

IMHO, the HD700 has more bass than both HD600 and HD800.  The HD700's bass is tight, punchy and fast, though the HD800′s bass is technically better.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
HD600 is bassier than the HD700 !!!!??

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I think that's probably the right progression bass wise regardless of graph. The higher up you go on the HD scale, the more refined and less prominent the bass becomes, as they become ever more balanced. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

It’s interesting that you prefer the HE-400 over LCD2.2.  Seems you prefer the planars with more trebles energy, if so you should try the LCD-X or Alpha Dog when you get a chance.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Thanks for the suggestion! Yeah I guess sometimes I like neutrality (HD600) and sometimes a V shape (HE400). To be fair to the LCD2.2 though my ranking takes into account cost and comfort, which is did poorly in compared to the others haha
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

#1) Koss Portapro -easily the best headphones outta the three working pairs I own that I even count as headphones, and they're going to be my go-to phones from now on because they sound so good, plus they look cool and are actually really comfortable once adjusted right.  The foam earpads do tend to get a little itchy, but that's not the phones' fault, foamies in general tend to get a little itchy.
 
#2) V-moda Bass Freq -decent IEMs for $20, but a little heavy on the lows, and the highs tend to be a little on the harsh side, plus IEMs tend to feel weird in my ears after a while.
 
#3) Sony MDR-V150 -they're OK closed-back supra-aurals for their price point, their sound is more than acceptable to me, as they were only $20, however the Portapros definitely blow them outta the water as far as sound quality goes. On comfort, they're good and comfortable for a few hours, but then they start to hurt after a while, and as far as durability goes, left headband snapped at the left adjuster on the bus back in August right when I was putting them on, however that was nothing that a crapton of tape on both the side that broke and the side that didn't couldn't fix. All in all, they're pretty much a good $20 set of closed-back on-ears, nothing special about them.
 
I do however wanna get my hands on either some SR60s (the original flush-housing SR60s, not the SR60i's), some MDR-V6s/7506s, or some ATH-M50s at some point in my life though. :)
 
I also have some earbuds that came with my Sansa Clip+, but I don't even count those as headphones, because stock MP3 player earbuds pretty much universally suck balls.

dude, I like your style. comfortable with the budget phones, and not one bit of snobbery. Very cool. I gave my Porta Pros to my brother in law for Christmas. He borrowed them to listen to some classical music, and didn't want to give them back. Loved the soundstage. I told him he could keep them. Now I have cheap ass Sony's and some old Sanyo's. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Thanks! The Portapros truly are epic headphones, listening to them paired with an EQ'd Sansa Clip+ currently and absolutely love them so far, and they actually sound best on the Sansa followed by my receiver and then my computer. Don't mean I don't wanna try Grados at some point in the future because I do, but still.
 
Portapros are definitely my fave sub-$50 headphone though, while the UR40s come in at a very close second place.
 
And the best thing about the Portapros (but I suppose this goes for Grados too) is they've used the same design for almost three decades now, which is really sweet.
 
PS: The ComfortZone seems to be the most comfortable on the middle or Light setting.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I'd go for the Grados man  the WOW factor you get with Grados is like what you have with the PortaPro only EVEN BETTER. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I guess that some may perceive HD700 bass as "light" because it's precise and has fast decay instead of "boomy" slow bass as for example HD650 has.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Also you can't go just by measurements. 
 
For example; a flat measuring closed can will sound like it has way more bass than a flat measuring open can. 
HD700 is a very different headphone design to the HD600 series, with bigger earpads etc. Naturally it should measure better, but the actual experience on-ear will be different. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My list，
 
1. Stax SR-009（great details，best transparent，very satisfied mid and bass）
 
2. HD800（very balance and very transparent，wide soundstage）
 
3. LCD-3（very warm sound，much better than HD650. bass is very good）
 
4. TH900（I like TH900 sound very much，though it is not very balance. also wide soundstage）
 
5. HD650（warm sound，beautiful）
 
6. HD600（a little balance than HD650，but soundstage is not as good as HD650）
 
7. DT880（250Ohm）（great sound for its price，more transparent than HD600，but the HD600‘s tone is better than DT880）
 
If I buy a new headphone，I will update the list.
 
LCD-3 is not in the picture because it has been sent to America audeze. Audeze will repair it for right no sound.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Sold my JVC HA-DX3's, gave away my Sony's and Sanyo, and kept my Roland RH-200. The comfort is the best of all of those, and the sound is so clear and balanced, with beautiful detail, great timbre, and decent soundstage. Ok soundstage isn't the best, but heck, it's not like they are $1000 Sennheisers!

Considering you have the HD600, I'd say the HE-500 is the closest in sound while the TH600 is almost the complete opposite. You also sent back/sold a LCD2 and HE-400 - The HE-500 is similar to the LCD2 just with a fair bit more treble and larger soundstage. The treble is not harsh/sibilant like the HE-400 can be at times.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


They are incredibly transparent and clear, it's even alot better in this area than $700 open headphones like the Sennheiser HD700 (I don't own this headphone, but I did A/B testing against my Shure SE535). 
 
The fun factor is a personal thing. It sounds very smooth, clear, detailed with a great soundstage. It's better to test it out since I don't know what type of colour you like best. (for example: some like the more flat / neutral sounding westone 4R or the more bassy Shure SE846)

If we were going all the top ones I've heard
 
Audeze LCD X ~ HD800 ~ LCD 3 ~ HE-6
T1 ~ TH900
LCD 2 r2 ~ HE-5LE
TH600
HE-500
 
My personal preferences. The TH600 is about 85% of the TH900 for me, ofc YMMV for different tastes/experiences.
 
The LCD 3/X - HE-6 - 5LE were only brief listens and are only estimations on my part to where they'd stack up for my preferences
 
I only prefer the TH600 to the 500 because my listening is about 30% electronic these days and they get the most usage. The others to me are "technically" better for more styles.

The IEM SoundMagic ES18 is superior to all of these in detail, but it is complicated to explain. It's as though everything is compressed and all detail pushed up, with an odd harmonic suck out that runs across the entire spectrum. I can hear things with them that all of these hps simply don't catch.
Past few weeks I usually listen on the 668 or 681b or KSC75's. Don't care for the 681f presentation. Good sound, standard SuperLux quality but I just don't like it that much. The H840 is a CAL1 Classic clone with a bit less treble and slightly smaller soundstage. CAL! just not getting much time lately and the Edifier not used much at all.
I have another 8 pairs of very mid-fi cans but none are worth mentioning.

Yeah, the HD598 is technically better; however, I ranked the headphones by current enjoyment and use ^^
 
Some 7 months ago I only had the Sennheiser CX300-II, Momentum and HD598, and the HD598 was by far my favourite.
 
However, after listening to some more headphones, I discovered my true sonic preferences and the HD598 kinda lost its magic. It didn't have quite the clarity I want when listening to heavy metal, nor the bass impact I want when listening to electronic and pop. So it became a dead weight for me (it's now borrowed to a friend btw)
 
The Momentum, on the other hand, is still quite fun to listen.
 

 
Well, some bass impact is important to me.
 
To my ears the Momentum midrange is smoother (tough it get congested more easily), and it also have a much taller soundstage, which I often find more enjoyable than the horizontally wide, but vertically compressed, soundstage of the HD598.
 
I should add that my HD598 have a unusually huge dip in the 7500 Hz area (like, some 15 db or more). I think it makes it sound duller than it should.
 
Overall, I just think the Momentum is more fun. That is all.

it's all about fun! When fun starts taking a backseat to analytics and utmost accuracy, then you start losing out on what the artists originally intended for the music..for it to be fun and for you to lose yourself in the art. My Roland RH-200 are the least technically capable of all the cans I've owned in the mid tier range, but I wouldn't trade them for their incredible fun factor. Oh and they do have technical merit. Like TF 10's supersized.

Well, now that I have a Beyerdynamic MMX 300, which is apparently a DT770 32-ohm with a good mic attached...the second place on my list is now getting quite contested.
 
The Sony MDR-MA900 still wins out in overall comfort and soundstage, but the MMX 300 easily bests it in treble reproduction (not like that's difficult for me) and not leaking sound out...plus that mic is actually of decent quality for VoIP and makes for a gaming headset that doesn't suck, albeit overpriced at MSRP. Then again, the MA900's overpriced at MSRP too; I got 'em both for around the $150 mark with shipping.
 
Of course, the original Stax SR-Lambda still beats both of those and everything else I've heard hands-down, but it also demands far more in terms of amplification like all electrostatic sets do...and regrettably, I don't own it or the SRM-T1 anymore, just the "beater" set, but that's the way things go when you need money fast.

1. K702 (w/ bass mod) - love the resolution
2. HD600 - ditto, albeit with an almost opposite (sonic) perspective
3. DT990pro - they're just fun
4. DT880/600 - sometimes, at night, I have to take the HP off and check if the speakers are playing. That's how enveloping they can seem. Relatively unexciting tonal balance at first listen.
4. AD900x - beautifully delicate mids and highs, proportional lows. Most comfortable cans I own
4. K612 - warmer tonal balance than the K702, more bass, less overall resolution, fairly forgiving
5. MDR-V6 - Only use them for turntable setup. Overall, I find their highs and upper mids unlistenable
X - K550 - just got them, no opinion as of yet. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) AKG K612 Pro: They just sound real to me.
 
2.) Sennheiser HD 555(soundstage modded): Very forgiving and non-harsh in the treble, nice for those times where I'm oddlly sensitive to treble and on unusually harsh recordings. Robust bass that extends quite deep. Vocals are too forward(especially male) and it's on the boring side. It's also a bit veiled sounding and somewhat lacking in resolution.
 
3.) Sansui SS-2(Brainwavz HM5 pads): Insanely musical and very full midrange, smooth treble, rather subpar and light in bass. Surprisingly good soundstage and imaging. It's on the veiled side but has a sound signature I have never heard before and is oddly addicting.
 
4.) Sennheiser PX-100 ii: Bassy and musical sounding, bass can intrude into the midrange some, lacks resolution and is a bit veiled.
 
5.) AKG K240 MKII(w/ Zu Audio cable): Very fun and musical with lots of mid-bass and upper bass while also keeping a nice smooth midrange. But the massive 10khz treble spike is just too much for me to handle and causes ear fatigue. If it wasn't for the treble spike this headphone would be number 2 on my list.

So what's the deal with the OM Audios? 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Wonderfully tuned single BA/single dynamic driver hybrid. Lively and balanced. Not v-shaped and with sucked out mids like the majority of single/single hybrids. A solid performer for the same cost as JVC FXT90. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Very intriguing... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I'm enjoying them immensely. Just very musical and detailed. Clear. Oh so good while listening to metal. The guitars are so edgy and sharp. Great treble extension. Bass is there but balanced. It comes to the forefront when needed or called upon, and it's a refined bass. Not a boomy LF driver.

Yep compared to the two beyers, the Yamahas, the akgs, and the fostex, they sound ..... Muffled and hollow. It's weird. The dt990 pro surprisingly can output the same amount of bass while keeping the vocals esp female pristine.

Here is a review for the Hope VI. I am not really good at describing it so shall not mislead anyone. The SQ itself is good but only down side is it might not be comfortable enough for everyone.

But do you really, honestly place it below the HD201 in terms of SQ? I just can't fathom that.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Could be based on comfort or other things as well.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX




Yes actually, tho I do use the he400 more, due to the sennys being a little weird fitting. The he 400 is actually very comfortable. Now what they do good is the bass, no denying that by any stretch. The dt990 surprisingly can do more bass, like detach retinas hard and low bass like can't use the bass booster on my amp concussion inducing skull cracking bass.  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Grado 225i. My flag ship.
Yamaha EPH-100. Best iem I have ever owned.
°Audio Technica ATH-PRO500MK2. Good on the ear for on the go.
°Koss PRODJ200. My closed back preference for home use.
NVX XPT-100. Best comfort of all my headphones but if they had a slightly decreased soundstage,they would behind the 225i.
Koss UR40. Cheap build,short cable,bass sounds plastic. I still think their overall sound is good for their price.
°they both sound the same to me but the 500 has better build qualities and clamping force.Edited by dwayniac - 1/10/14 at 2:19am

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

My ranking isn't based on sound quality or aspects of sound quality alone, but more on the total experience and enjoyment they gave/give me. Hence a Portapro ranking higher than the DT880 and k701. 
My genres are mostly extreme metal, dark ambient, neofolk and classical.
1. Sennheiser Hd600 (exactely my prefered signature)
2. Sennheiser Hd580 (95% of the HD600, best value headphone in the world)
3. Sennheiser Hd25-1 II (perfect portable)
4. Koss Portapro (fun, cheap, charming, musical)
5. Sennheiser Hd590 (most comfortable headphone I own, great for metal)
6. Grado Sr60 (the one that started it all)
7. Teufel Aureol Real (light, comfortable, balanced)
8. Yoga cd-880/Brainwavz Hm5 (isolation without too much sacrifice)
9. Beyerdynamic dt880 250ohm (detailmonster, comfortable, too bright)
10. Grado Sr225i (too uncomfortable, too bright, too constricted)
11. AKG k701 (detailmonster, no center, we just never clicked)
12. Audio Technica ath-ad700 (great for gaming, positioning is amazing, basslight)
13. Superlux hd668b (great value, hot treble, plasticky)
14. Superlux hd662 (same as hd668b, good bass, uncomfortable)
15. Sony xb700 (BASS)
16. Yoga cd-340 (ultra affordable, nice soundstage, weird mids)
17. Superlux HD651 (fun, ultra cheap)
18. Sennheiser hd202 (decent, boomy)
19. Sennheiser hd280pro (uncomfortable, mediocre sound)
20. Sennheiser hd201 (meh)
21. Kanen Km880 (worse than the sound of your favourite dog dying)
IEMs
1. Hifiman RE0 (amazing detail, comfortable, high end sound, needs amp, basslight but responds wonderfully to eq)
2. Sony MH1c (best value, musical, comfortable, terrible flat cable)
3. Brainwavz M2 (comfortable, lovely tuning, addictive bass)
4. Dunu DN19 Tai Chi (uncomfortable, silly bass ports, amazing build, alrounder)
5. Brainwavz ProAlpha (cheap alrounder, nice cable, fun)
6. Teufel Fidelity (great build quality, too consumer oriented)
7. Monoprice 8323 (unwearable, ugly, meh)
8. Everything Kanen (i prefer silence)
I've got a Vsonic GR07 and Havi B3 Pro coming, looking forward to ranking them. Edited by Negakinu - 1/10/14 at 10:00am .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

I got the HAVI B3 coming too, as well as the DUNU DN-1000, so my rankings are on hold.

My current list:
 
1. HE-6
2. HD800
3. T1
4. T5p (portable)
5. GS1000i
6. W3000ANV
7. Polk Ultrafocus 8000 (ANC)
8. UE900 (really dislike IEMs)
 
Recently sold: LCD2.2 - they just have no place in the collection with the HE-6 around.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

LCD2.2
LA5000
RS1i
Q701

But I like them all in their own way, some do different genres of music better than others and some do movies better.
 
I will wait till later in life to progress higher into this hobby. When I get my own place I will start doing speakers :)

Then you need the T1. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


To be fair, the T1s only have a bit more bass than the DT880/600s. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
What about Beats by Dre Pro, a lot of bass. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
LOL, there are even bassier headphones out there like the original Beats Studios?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I used to have one of the original Beats Studio, the Pro has more bass. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Really? I'd say it would be the other way around? Regardless, neither as good as the T1s. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Honestly, I think the T1s have enough bass quantity.  I like the T1 for Rush. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


And with this we are in complete agreement! 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Gladly.
The midrange and treble clarity, and sound-stage and instrument separation of the KSC-75 are such that they trump the impact and bass that the closed CAL has that the Koss' do not.
I am listening to the KSC right now and even compared to the Pro80's, I sometimes think they are better.
I must add a caveat in that I don't think that 'bass=good' is a valid criteria to judge a headphone, so I am willing to forgo the bass that many cannot live without, when judging a can. The Koss' lack bass, impact, heft and slam even when pressed against the pinnae or in a headband mod.
They are *that* good. Such a clean, hash-free and sibilance-free midrange and treble. Almost a 'sweet' quality to that part of the FR.
I am well into middle age, and it is often common for audiophiles that age to prefer sweet, clean, hash free, mids and treble, over other sonic considerations.
I suspect the 75's won't be bettered until I move to the HD-600 or so level.
Really, just outstanding.
{Ed.} I just had another one of those out-of-head binaural moments with the Koss that I don't get with any of my current stable. Perhaps (and I hope!) when I continue on up the price ladder, this will occur more often.
I am listening to Pell Mells "Interstate", the track Saucer and as the track ends and the band stops playing there are room sounds that come from behind me. I thought there were birds in the front yard, played the track again. Yep, sound coming from behind me. That is just eerie, and it doesn't happen with my other cans.Edited by marone - 1/11/14 at 8:51am

I will say I never planned on liking the HD 600 from the way it was described, but I took a chance and it paid off surprisingly well. The HD 700 was exactly the same. I guess there's a certain amount of faith Sennheiser given me. Still, the only alliance I have is to my ears.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Top four:
 
1: Sony DR-Z7:
 
--Simply incredible. Insane transients that make everything sound organic and real, absolutely ruthlessly revealing and extremely transparent/neutral, impact not only in the bass but throughout the entire sound spectrum, and completely devoid of harshness, etch, or noise. All in a small, supra-aural, foldable package. Almost entirely constructed of die-cast aluminum; easily the best built headphone I've ever held. Timeless styling. Excellent isolation. On the downside they have no soundstage with most material and aren't super comfortable for long (3+ hour) sessions. These headphones are a completely different beast from anything else I've heard, it feels like there's nothing between me and the music, even without a dedicated DAC or amp. I'm almost scared to think about what these could do out of a world class rig. 
 

 
 
2: Fostex TH600:
 
--My "fun" cans. While the Z7 is better in every area except soundstage, these still see a lot of use, mostly with music that doesn't have the best production values in the world. They have a very enjoyable, bassy tonality with flat-line treble extension and a very wide, deep soundstage. Some bass impact, but nothing like the Zs. They have a bit of splash and hiss on the treble caused by a lack of control; it'd probably improve with better amplification but nothing can eliminate it. Keep in mind this is all relative to the Z7; these headphones are aeons ahead of most of the other things I've heard. Extremely comfortable, big and beautiful. 
 

 
3: Pioneer SE-500 (modded):
 
--I honestly do not know why these are still on here, but for whatever reason these headphones are still listenable. They don't have bass, at all, and they're kind of splashy, but what they do have is a ridiculously smooth sound with razor flat treble extension and an amazing crispness to the sound that's extremely pleasing to the ears. Excellent soundstage and imaging, though a bit restricted in width. They're bright, but in a very special way, and I adore them. Amazing for metal. Plasticy build, clamp like a bitch, thin pads. Gorgeous.
 

 
4: Sony MDR-605 (modded):
 
--My beaters, and portables of choice. These are the consumer version of the Sony MDR-F1, and have a very good, VERY good soundstage, with a slightly warm, natural tonal balance and pleasing bass. Not the most detailed thing in the world but still quite good with nice treble extension. Unfortunately they are extremely rare, likely due to sounding like complete garbgage in stock form. Sony crammed a lot of frontwave damping on it to make it bassier, at the cost of everything else. Removing it gets rid of the nasty bass bloom and opens up the sound, giving it air and spaciousness as well as nice, crisp treble. You may be curious why a fully open headphone is my portable of choice, and that's because I hang out with friends a lot and this way I can hear everything around me. A bit meh on the build side, but good for a featherlight design. Pretty interesting looks wise, but kind of silly on the head.
 

 
Nothing else sees any use, save for one more honorable mention:
 
Koss PRO/4AAAT:
 
--Extremely underrated. These headphones have decay similar to the Zs and are generally very very clean sounding with extremely impactful bass and good imaging and soundstaging. However, the tonality is borderline veiled. They're very heavily colored as the driver topology was designed for vocal monitoring. Most people won't be very pleased with it, which is why they have such a bad reputation. However they isolate unlike anything else, so these are my other portables, used for when I can afford to keep everything outside at bay. Big and beautiful. Good build.

I'm back and I'm much farther into this hobby than I would have liked to have been at this point in time
Headphones:
1.Sennheiser HD800: This... is an amazing experience that has everything I've ever wanted in a pair of cans
(tied)2. Beyerdynamic Dt250: after quite alot of burnin (around 40 something) and a little bit of modding these things are excellent for whenever I need to quench my hip-hop fix or when I need extensive amounts of isolation.
(tied)2.Shure srh840:the excess amount of detail and great (although a bit thin) soundstage makes this great for whenever I need to play some games, or when I want a very neutral experience
(tied)2.Grado Sr60i: when I got these cans I was very pleasantly surprised to how wonderful the grado signature sound is and how portable these cans are
3. Denon Hp700: anyone who knows me knows I love these things to death for how well they can do everything with a very neutral approach while being very portable, but without much Isolation, while still being able to give off a sun sound if need be (via eq)
 
IEM:
1. Klipsch X10: my favorite because of the excellent detailing that I can't get with any other IEM
2.Monster Gratitude: nice pretty pair of IEMs that are sometimes comfy
 
STUFF NOT ON LIST:
 
Due to death:
1. HD439: this poor peppy pair of cans was amazingly fun not only to listen to, but also to mod, it was what got me here to this point, and I'm truly grateful to have bought it.
 
Due to being in mod/workshop:
1.AKG K240 SEXTETT: in for a nice cleaning/refresh on parts, and is here for a recable
2.Audio-technica WS-99: in for a headband and resoldering fix
 
Due to being en route/Kickstart:
1.Piston 2.0: was a large recommendation from the discovery thread (also I'm a science nerd so I find it pretty cool )
2.Velodyne Vfree: free bluetooth headphones
3.Aurisonic Rockets: looks great at a very nice price

2. Grado SR-80i Modded (best sound off all, but limited to quiet indoor usage)
3. Klipsch X10 (really smooth clean sound, recently my ears seem to be rejecting having them inserted, they used to be INCREDIBLY comfortable) .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

Well I currently own 4 but I will list 5 headphones in my list since I owned it for a long time and just this weekend I gave it away to a family member who needs some head-fi introduction/education. 
 
1. Beyerdynamic T5p - amazing, perfect for my closed-headphone needs. Very detailed, warm, good imaging, great soundstage for a closed headphone (the depth is fantastic, all orchestral layers and textures clearly positioned, incredible with well recorded baroque music).
2. Audio-Technica  ATH-W5000 - used to be my favorites, but they lack detail and transparency next to the T5p. Voices are good but bass is very weak. 
3. Sennheiser HD650 - not suitable for me (for now) because of its open back, but also a little too neutral for my taste. 
4. PSB  M4U2 - noise cancelling, I needed one of this type for specific situations and they are really good for a NC headphone.
5. Sennheiser HD380 Pro - My first non-Bose non-Sony not-too-cheap pair of headphones, opened my ear to better things but now I find it quite dry, though well detailed. I gave them away to a young relative who likes music and needed some headphones to save him from Beats-hell... 
 
Future projects:
Closed cans: none really, I don't expect any closed-can to perform significantly better then the T5ps to justify the purchase. 
Open cans: HD800, LCD-3 or, ideally, a Stax electrostatic. Though I would like to try to get at least the SR-007MK2, since I know the 009 will be pretty much a pipe dream. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Based on how much I enjoy listening to each headphone including comfort, portability, ease of use, and sound.
 
1.) Sennheiser HD 558 (custom pads)
2.) ATH-M50 (shure 940 pads)
3.) UE-6000
4.) Sony XBA-1
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) Audeze LCD 2.2 (The best headphones I've listened to so far, a lot more comfortable to wear than the HE-500s in my opinion)
2.) HiFiMAN HE-500 (They are right up there with the LCD 2.2s, I haven't really managed to make a fair comparison yet because of imbalance (they are in for service, they will most likely change both drivers)
3.) BeyerDynamic DT 990 Pro 250 Ohm (I used these for 2 - 3 years before I finally went all in on the HE-500s, really, really comfortable and great for gaming. They are decent for music, good for bassheads, but I can't even compare these to the LCD 2.2s in terms on sound quality)
4.) BeyerDynamic DT 250 80 Ohm (Used these before I got the 990s, lasted me a year and was great for the price, I got them used from a friend, but I am not really a fan of fully closed headphones)
 
I used to have the Fostex TH-600s, sent them back, too bright for me. Bass was great though, nothing like the deep Audeze bass though.. (I currently have my eyes on a couple of fully modded D7000s that I might get.)
 
I also owned the AKG Q701, a bit bright, weak bass but they had great detail, sold them after a month of use.

Uh what? The TH600 isn't bright... quite the inverse imo. It does have some splash up top though. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) AKG K612 PRO: Linear, natural, and very musical sounding. A lot of detail, revealing, transparent, and very accurate imaging and soundstage. Great extension in both extremities. Surprising sub-bass for an open-back dynamic. Very dynamic and has a lot of physicality and body to it's sound with the right system. It's quite demanding and picky.
 
2.) Sennheiser HD 380 Pro: A bit on the warm and forgiving side, good detail, and good comfort after some breaking in. A strangely enjoyable sound with the right system. Has a reverb to the sound and can sound excessively closed-in on some systems.
 
3.) AKG K240 MKII: One of the most addicting sounding headphones I have heard, surprising clarity and detail for it's price, but has one major flaw that takes away from it's enjoyability; a massive treble spike that causes sibilance to go crazy.
 
4.) Sennheiser PX-100 ii: Dark and bassy with a somewhat musical sound, surprisingly good for an on-ear. Does lack some refinement and detail and has a slight veil over the sound. Great for portable use.
 
5.) Sennheiser HD 555 modded: My first open-back headphone, it's always been a mixed bag for me. It's always been fairly neutral, but lacks refinement, clarity, and detail. It's also quite veiled sounding. It's very dull and very boring, a bit of a snooze-fest.
 
6.) Sansui SS-2: Was a curiosity into trying vintage headphones, extremely addicting midrange, has quite good imaging and soundstage, but the bass is severely lacking and the highs are not the most detailed but are pleasant. With brainwavz hm5 pads one of the most comfortable headphones I own.

Same thoughts...until I removed the little sticker on the bass port. Difference was night/day.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Doing this kills the Q's neutrality and I advise against it. If something sounds bright with the Qs, it's mixed bright. It's not the headphone.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I agree. A neutral headphone should sound dark, neutral, or bright depending on the actual recording, system, etc. Although that's not what everyone wants. I do think the Q701 is a tad on the bright and lean side imo but overall quite neutral, it's not as neutral and accurate as the K612 though imo.Edited by kman1211 - 1/28/14 at 11:00pm

For me it's:
 
1. HE-6
2. HD800
 
I've owned much more than these two but these are what I currently have.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
It was piercing to my ears.. Used them for tops 10 hours before I sent them back. I thought trying to settle them in might have helped, but it didn't.
They just didn't work for me :)

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Neutral ~ Lacking low end?
Cause stock the Q701 have very anemic bass. I kept it for its strength as a gaming headphone in online shooters. But I probably hadn't listened to any music on it in a year. I have spent hours upon hours enjoying it as a music headphone after the mod. Not to mention how much better explosions sound in BF4. Neutral or not, the mod was a MAJOR improvement for me. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 

Not many people is placed HE-6 higher than HD 800 or LCD-3. I am glad to see this :)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I hate statements like these.  It's not true.  Put on a recording with deep and solid bass, and you'll hear deep and solid bass.  Maybe not to the point of something like the Hifiman HE400, but saying it's bass is anemic, or "Lacking vitality; listless and weak", is either a subjective opinion based on a basshead's distorted notion of what good bass is, or it's simply an objectively incorrect statement.
 
We could argue all day, but compare to 3 other headphones, Beyer 990, known as a bass monster, Grado SR80, considered a quite good headphone, and HD600, another 'classic'.
 


Yes, the 990 will have MORE bass because of it's 100-130hz bass hump, but another headphone without this emphasized bass is not anemic...  Anyhow, I guess it's something people just will never agree on...   I have the 990 and the Q701, yes, the 990 has more bass, and yes, it might sound more substantial, but saying the Q701's bass is anemic is ludicrous. 
 
If the recording has very little bass, yes, you'll hear very little bass on the Q701, and you might hear what you consider a 'normal' amount of bass on the 990.  Doesn't mean the Q701 lacks bass.  As on a record with a lot of bass, you'll hear a lot of bass on the Q701, and you'll more than likely hear much more bass on the 990. 
 
More bass is not better, and headphones which doesn't emphasize bass are not anemic...

Also some people here in head-fi believe the HE-6 and HE-500 are in the same league. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Nobody who has heard both and heard the HE-6 well-driven believes this. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


When I first heard the HE-6 and the HE-500 off a mjolnir, I actually thought the HE-500 sounded slightly better. I thought both were a level below the HD800 on the same amp. When I connected the HE-6 through a 100wpc integrated amp through the speaker taps, my whole opinion changed. The HE-6 is now a level above the HD800 to my ears. My opinion of course.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



That's exactly the kind of experience I was talking about.
I share your opinion, but I think at that level of chain and headphone, providing all the headphones are well-driven, that it largely comes down to personal preference in sound presentation. At this (sub-Stax/Abyss) level opinions are predominantly distributed around the HD800, HE-6, and LCD-3/X.Edited by NZtechfreak - 1/29/14 at 7:02pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Perhaps not for you, but audio is incredibly subjective and while one person may hear a lack of bass, another may hear just enough bass. Anemic also means lacking power or energy. This is how I feel about the Q701 before the mod. Trance was simply not something I could get into w/ the stock Q701. Now that there's some oomph to the lower end, the headphone does a wonderful job w/ this genre. I am much happier now and just wanted to express that for those that may also be hearing the same thing. If you like the sound stock, great. But if another fella/fellar doesn't, now they have a way to "fix" the problem.
 
I could also understand if I was the only person on this forum that hears a much more natural low end and that the Q/K 701 was still neutral after the mod, but I'm not...
 

 
In fact, the vast majority of folks that have tried this mod have nothing but praise for it.

On the topic of speaker amping headphones, how would tapping a T50RP work? Would this be manageable?? I'm thinking about getting a ZMF sometime, and if I could feed that baby with my 60 WPC Kenwood speaker amp that would no doubt be incredible.
In more on topic news, I'm LOOOOVING these V6's with anything non rock, way more than my SR80i's. So the Grados Woop it for anything rock related, especially prog like Yes and Pink Floyd, but for dance, classical, and just about the rest of my library, these V6's are something else man. Mmm mmm mmm. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The T50RP has a high enough max input to be safely driven from speaker taps, hell people sometimes take the drivers out and use them as tweeters in DIY speakers. However, I'd suggest building a resistor network for them.

4. AKG K272 HD
5. Ashidavox TKM-62

I'd have to add that while this is still a ranking from best to worst in regards to sound, they all have their own niches, especially considering portability, privacy and ergonomics.

5. JVC HA-S500
6. Sony ZX700

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
At least to me, the K271's offer two variables that allow them to sound a bit different than the K272's. The first being that if you keep the stock leatherette pads on, instead of switching them out with the included soft velour pads (which are similar to what the K272 has), the seal over your ears is a little tighter, which blocks out more outside noise, and seems to add to the bass, but also takes away from the comfort level a bit. The second being that you can replace the stock XLR cable; I use an Oyaide HPC-X35 XLR, which seems to add a bit of clarity and richness to the sound, especially the highs. Overall, with different pads and a different cable, the K271's end up sounding a lot less "laid-back" than the K272's, to use a term I've heard others use when describing the AKG sound. I actually got the K271's mostly for use in public; the tighter seal of the leatherette pads, the option of a shorter, more manageable cable, and a "kill-switch" mechanism in the headband that mutes the headphones when you remove them from your head make them more suitable than the K272's for a portable rig (about as portable as any AKG K-series pair of headphones can be). The difference in sound was honestly just a "happy accident".
 
I know this may sound a bit odd, since I'm not particularly well-versed in audiophile jargon, but I would best describe the difference between the two like this. If you were at a bar listening to a jazz band, the K271's would be the seats directly in front of the band, maybe one or two tables back; the people sitting there might enjoy a drink or two, but they'd mostly be focused on listening intently to the music. The K272's, on the other hand, would be the seats farther back towards the bar, including the bar stools; the people sitting there would be there because they appreciate the music, but they might also be reading, doing work, etc., and while the music still sounds beautiful, it might serve a more ambient role.
 
Having said all this, I honestly couldn't see myself owning both of them if they had price tags similar to the K701's, but since the K272's and the K271's with a decent aftermarket XLR cable can both be purchased for about $150 apiece, they're different enough in terms of sound and also ergonomics to justify owning both of them.

I tend to lean towards the more bass heavy headphones:
 
VSonic GR07 Bass Edition
DT770 tied with HD558
AKG K550
Atrio MG7
Senn SE215
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Apparently the K550 was criticized for not having enough bass, but do correct me if I'm wrong :p I'm wondering because you've ranked it above the SE215 which is apparently a basshead IEM.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I really like the soundstage on the K550. Makes it really good for gaming and I tend to enjoy full-size headphones anyways. I also found that the bass was still present in the K550 and just ramped up the EQ a bit to get more quantity.
 
EDIT: Meant to add a quote.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


You sure love that bass a lot then! 
 

Criticized by whom?  IMHO, the 550s are already sitting on the warm side, and it's bass goes quite deep... Maybe you're mixing up the K/Q701?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I've read how AKG designed the K545 to have more bass based on user complaints that the K550 didn't have enough...of course, that could just be consumers confusing 'OMGTONSOFBASS' with 'emphasized bass'.
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The problem with the K550 is getting a proper seal, it can be a huge PITA especially if you have a small head. If you do manage to get them to seal right, they have excellent bass.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
The K550 has a lot of sub-bass.   I think that most bassheads are into mid-bass...that could be one of the reason some people say that the K550 does not have enough bass.    As takato already mentioned, getting a good seal is important if you want to get any bass from this model.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


That's all down to the fit and getting a good seal. If you're head is small, it doesn't work!

Beyer COP
 
Not much cans yet.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Here's an updated list:
 
1. Sennheiser Amperior - Easy to drive, makes everything sound great. Reltively inexpensive (original MSRP $350, bought for $220, now can be had for $180 or even less), they actually scale up nicely with better equipment (usually use them on my laptop running the FiiO X3 as the DAC and E9 as an amp, or the FiiO X3 as the player and E12 as the amp): running off my Asgard2/Uber Bifrost stack, I can tell the increase in quality of sound, everything is smoother, more detailed, bass is tighter, etc.
 
2. Sennheiser HD700-HD650 (Tie) - The 700 took a good long while to grow on me, and at first I thought I was going to send them back. Here's the thing: if you have the right components (not necessarily more expensive), they will blow the doors off the 650s on 70% of the music I listen to: the soundstage is much much wider, the imaging is more precise, and they are much more detailed. They do lack a bit on the bass impact compared to the HD650 (which aren't basshead cans to begin with), but with the RIGHT equipment, and MOST music, you probably will appreciate the tighter more detailed bass. It definitely has a treble peak at around 6Khz that can definitely kill the enjoyment on some songs, but again, a good amp/dac combo with help a lot (though it wont solve the issue completely, you need to EQ the cans to absolutely minimize this issue). I am running them off Schiit's Uber-Analog Stage Bifrost DAC and the Asgard2 amp and the 700s really like the Asgard2 and absolutely love the Bifrost. I do feel that perhaps a warmer amp might suite these cans better. They would be overpriced at their MSRP of $1000, luckily I got them for $650, and at that price point, I would say they are about fairly priced: the only knock is that pesky treble peak which should not be an issue for a $650 headphone; although I would prefer a bit more bass, it wouldn't be fair to say a $650 can SHOULD have more bass, because this would be a matter of sound signature preference (vs say a sloppy bass presentation or a pesky treble peak).
 
By comparison, for the longet time I thought the HD650s could not be beat. Once you fed it enough power, they made everything sound so damn good. The bass has always been nice a tight, and hits (relatively) hard. Just a very smooth, relaxed presentation. Compared to my closed headphones, the wider soundstage when A/B the headphones is immediately noticeable. It is not a basshead can, but even on bass heavy song, where I would wish the 650 had more, it has enough bass such that I would not trade them for another can because they make everything else in a bass heavy song sound so damn good; I can't say the same for the HD700s, there are just some songs where the bass is lacking enough that I NEED to switch headphones. The HD650s only 'fault' is that they require a whole lot of power to drive them to any good level, however, unlike the HD700, they are not picky about where that power comes from, nor are they picky about source. They sounded great running off the X3 or microstreamer DAC, to the FiiO E9, they sounded great running off the Oppo BDP105 analog outs to the E9. At an MSRP $500, they are worth it, with the only complaint is that they don't sound nearly as remarkable at low volumes (where as the HD700 retains its incredible sound even at low volumes); that they require alot of power is not an issue at $500, because we tend to EXPECT audiophile level cans to be high impedance. I bought mine for $360, which makes them the value of the century, giving the Amperiors a run for their money in the value department.
 
4. Sennheiser Momentum Over Ear - I had actually purchased the Momentums prior to buying the Amperiors. When I first got them, I absolutely loved them. Right away, I could tell they didn't have the detail of the HD650s, but that bass hit so damn hard, was so well composed compared to my niece's Beats, that I just didn't care: they were exactly what I was looking for in a portable can. I needed something that closed back, something that was easy to drive, and something that had a rich, full, and impactful sound signature to drown out the sound of the street, students, etc; the added bonus was how gorgeous they were!!! Yes, the bass could get a lil messy and bleed into the mids, but my only real portable comparison at that point was the Beats, which did nothing particularly well, except bass IMPACT, so an MSRP of $350 was more than reasonable, and I was happy to pay the $300 for them when I finally got them. So all was roses in Momentum land, that is until the Amperiors showed up. The Amperiors trounced the Momentums in each and every single way, except for bass impact and style. Amperiors where much more detailed, the bass was much tighter and never bled into the mids, yet the bass was never lacking (even if it wasnt as heavy as the Momentums), then of course there was that issue with the price: at their MSRP, I could see the Momentums being equal to the Amperiors: I saw it as a preference between bass impact + style vs. a more detailed, more controlled, yet more aggressive headphone. But at $300 vs $220, I could not see any justification for going for Momentums over Amperiors, and I viewed the extra $80 as a tax on style. Its not that the Momentums are worse headphones now, than when I first got them, it's that they are trounced by Amperiors. I still love my Momentums, but they get much less playing time with the Amperiors kickin around.

2. Thinksound ON1 (this thing actually sound more detail than the Momentum, however On-ear is it fall. Its still comfortable but I cant go on for hours without breaks like i do with the momentum)
3. B&W P5 (sound good, but again comfort was the key
4. B&W P7 (I really dint like the sound of the P7 compare to the P5, its just something off about it to my ear, plus its very uncomfortable on my asian head)

But, if the source is bad (bad mp3), I prefer the PX100 or PortaPros for listening to that :)

Geez, why so low on the HD590 for everything but gaming? Most people say its 98% of the HD600, just a little bit brighter...
 
(I've been eyeing the 590s for a very long time so I'd like to hear your thoughts)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'd say it's more personal preference.  I think over the years my tastes have changed and my music tastes as well.  I love the HD590s (I even still have the Sennheiser watch that came with them) as I love all the headphones that I ranked, they were my very first audiophile level headphone.  I actually use the 590s more than my 598s (590s are so comfortable) and I'm on my 3rd pair of earpads with the 590s and on my 2nd cable.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Ehhh, yeah times have changed... maybe I went through a weird phase? I still have the Quarts, I just don't use them anymore. I find it weird that I was so obsessed with the K501 when I usually had issues with the upper midrange and/or highs. I'm tempted to buy another K1000 again but I am not sure if I really find it useful for my needs.
 
Current standings of headphones I've used recently:
Rank 1: Q701, K240 Sextett, K240 Monitor (3 way tie)
Rank 2: DT880 600ohm (maybe rank 1 material)
Rank 3: K340, Quarts maybe?

I have Audio GD NFB 28 system. I also quoted my values from prices here in Australia. There was not much separating most headphones from one another in my preferences. Don't let my criticism seem too harsh many of these things are minor annoyances.Edited by Eternal Schism - 2/27/14 at 11:15pm

What I listen to:
 
1: Sony DR-Z7: Adore it more than anything.
2: Pioneer Monitor 10: Best soundstage ever. Has a way of making things sound "just right".
3: Audio Technica ATH-6D (modded): Still working on mods for this one, good all-rounder.
4: Sony MDR-605 (modded): Shockingly listenable. Used as my portables usually.
5: Pioneer SE-500: Doesn't see much use anymore with the Monitor 10 around. Similar but without bass, harder to drive, less comfortable.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

This is an interesting thread! I find it very difficult to rank the headphones I own because I specifically assembled a set that is supposed to be varied, so each headphone is here for different purposes. Therefore, I can't really compare them... in any case, some brief comments. The first six are my main headphones, and the other three are here but don't see as much use.
 
1) Sennheiser HD800
This is the new boy. I had one a while ago, didn't like it but now I've got one again and I'm loving it. In terms of soundstage, imaging and detail retrieval, there's really nothing like it, at least as far as dynamic drivers are concerned. I used to own a K1000 and even though it has an out-of-the-head soundstage, it's still relatively congested and doesn't portray a stage as realistically as the Senns. I also had the chance of staying a month with an Orpheus/Aristaeus combo, and while it's easily a better headphone overall, the diffuse soundstage is not nearly as precise as the HD800's. I've been using it for various genres, but they work best with genres that benefit from extreme transparency, spaciousness and a slightly analytical nature – that is, jazz, classical, acoustic pieces and reference recordings in general.
 
1) Grado HP1000
Extremely natural sound. It's much smoother and more laid back than current Grados, but it's still raw, crude and analog-like. They sound the real deal. Artists playing tired on a dirty stage. They work best with the same types of recordings where the HD800s shine, but for different reasons. However, they are far more enjoyable for rock and less capable with classical or when a spacious presentation is needed.
 
1) Audio-Technica W3000ANV
Incredibly luscious and seductive sound. It has an amazingly euphonic nature and do wonders with female vocals and jazz, mainly, but are also optimal when you just want to be warm, you know? This can happen with pieces like Turn Me On from Black Coffee but also with the likes of Justin Vernon or DeYarmond Edison. Different approaches to musical intimacy. They're obviously colored and not as natural as the other two, but for musical enjoyment, can best them in many cases.
 
1) HiFiMAN HE500
These have been here for a long time. They're the all-rounders, and work really well with everything. I usually use them for modern music – electronic, rock, metal or whatever. They have a very authoritative and powerful sound, with a warm presentation that just seems to suit everything. They're not as technically advanced or spacious as the Senns, as analog and real like the Grados or as seductive as the W3000ANV, but have a rather complete performance that's always adequate. It's not my favourite one, but since I'm rather eclectic, if I had to choose only one headphone, this would probably it. Or maybe it could also be the...
 
1) JH Audio Roxanne
It hasn't been here for long and I'm still maturing my opinions about it. I still respect it more than love it, but I can already say that they are easily the best in-ear headphones I've ever heard. They sound a lot more like headphones than earphones, but obviously without the spaciousness of the bigger brothers. They have a very thick sound, with a warm midrange and very clear and extended highs, without a hint of harshness. What strikes me most is how they combine warmness and fullness with extreme transparency and resolution. These last two characteristics are never thrown in your face, but will be there if you pay attention. The bass control is weird in that they don't seem to start from a lean sound – the Roxys sound very thinck with the bass at the minimum – with an increasing sub-bass boost that makes the sound thicker and more authoritative. What happens is that as you turn the knob up the bass starts to come and fill up a space that feels empty just below the mids. I just left it at 9 o'clock and was done with it. The sound is just nicely balanced and cohesive.
 
2) Sennheiser HD 25-1 II
This is my no-*****s-given headphone. It's really unattractive and badly finished, but they sound great for the price – energetic and punchy – and I don't have to worry about them breaking, scratching or anything. I just throw them on the backpack and that's it. Sometimes I don't want the fuss of the Roxannes – the case is really cool but spectacularly inconvenient and impractical, but I'm not very fond of the idea of just throwing the earphones around – or don't feel like using an IEM, and this is when the HD 25 fit like gloves. I really love these.
 
3) Sony EX1000
They don't sound much like the W3000ANV, but are also very very seductive and easy going. They're also really comfortable and have a very interesting soundstage. Not very precise but quite spacious. They haven't been seeing much use lately, but I'm very fond of them.
 
4) Etymotic Research MC3
To me they sound a lot like Grados. I also don't use them very much, but I think that with some recordings they sound incredibly natural, much in the same way as the HP1000s – although obviously not to the same degree. Also, probably because of the extreme isolation provided by the triple-flange tips, detail retrieval is really good and consequently they can show clear differences in the rooms of recordins. I mean, you can very clearly hear the room on some Kings of Convenience of Chris Whitley's recordings, for example. Therefore, while they're not very spacious, they can show space very competeltly.
 
5) Bang&Olufsen A8
These don't get much love around here, but I find their airy character to be very appealing, and apart from the lack of bass expected with an earbud, they sound really balanced.

Yes. I've read your feedback of the Presonus HD7 in the Superlux thread. From your feedback, the difference isn't big compared to the HD668B. Thing is, I want my next upgrade to be substantial. I'm saving up for something in the $200 to 400 range, preferably open or semi-open. 
I listen to a lot of classical, orchestra, jazz, older pop, disco, contemporary RnB etc. Not a lot of new stuff really.
i.e. 
Vivaldi - Four Seasons
Pokemon Reorchestrated, Kanto Symphony - Red's Journey (Route 3/4 theme)
Swing Out Sister - You On My Mind
Mariah Carey - Emotions
Aretha Franklin - Say A Little Prayer
Alicia Keys ft. Usher - My Boo
Mariah Carey - Honey
Since we're also talking about IEMs here. Anyone have the Sony EX310 or EX510? The ones with the 13.5 mm CCAW dynamic drivers? I tried the Walkman W-series (NWZ-W273 to be exact) which is basically a waterproof, all-in-one earphone music player and I was blown away by its sound. It also has those 13.5 mm drivers and I suspect it's the same driver on the EX310 or EX510. I doubt it'd have the same drivers as the EX600 since it costs more than twice the NWZ-W273.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

really limited selection but I'll at least comment on each for what it's worth
 
1. HD650 - I don't believe I have the right amplification for them at the moment and almost think my HD595's + little dot II++ sounded better in every way EXCEPT bass extension.  I'm driving my hd650's with schiit lyr and bifrost.  mids just feel.... cold.  They sounded so thick and warm on my hd595's on the little dot amp.  With the lyr and 650's, I feel like the mids are lacking.  This could completely contradict what my setups should reflect, but that's just my personal experience.  I could be remembering incorrectly and possibly just having higher than realistic expectations since the new gear cost so much more than the last setup.  I think something like the bottlehead crack amp would be better suited.  I'm still ranking it #1 on my list due to comfort and what everyone else who properly drives them rates them at.  I think I'll get a SS amp for these cans, and pick up some planar's for my lyr.  win-win, right?  except my wallet loses.  always.
 
2. HD595 - My first "audiophile" setup.  Little dot II++ amp.  Blew my mind.  And ears.  Had some crap bose tri-ports that broke after a short while.  They were sadly the best I had heard, and after going through set after set of crap headphones at best buy, I decided to research.  Then I stumbled upon head-fi and fell down a deep pit.  A money pit.  Of delicious phonics.  These headphones are great for a lot of things, but they lack greatly in bass.  There's just no punch, and no extension.  Don't get these if you have to have bass in your music.  There's just a large lack of it.  Get closed headphones if you want bass.  These open 595's have a great open airy sound to them.  Vocals sound great on them.  Comfort is a big thing with senny and these are light and comfy.
 
3. monoprice high fi dj style headphones - don't hate!  they sound great for $26.  I actually like them better than my ATH-50's.  Quite a bit more.  First of all, they're more comfy.  They're MUCH lighter, and they squeeze less.  I also like the sound quality overall. 
 
4. ATH-50 - probably the most recommended entry headphones ever.  they're great.  they were great.  until those monoprice ones were discovered for a fraction of the cost. 
 
I've owned other junk before my "good" headphones.  None are worth mentioning.  Most of it sucked worse than my $10 walmart koss on-ear headphones. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Ehh... changed my mind.
 
1: Sony DR-Z7:
--Perfection in everything but soundstage. Bar none.
 
2: Pioneer Monitor 10:
--Perfection in soundstage, greatness in everything else. Strangely sweet and special sounding with my favorite soundstage of anything, closed or open.
 
3: Pioneer SE-500 (modded):
--I thought the magic of these would be gone after the Monitor 10 came along since they sound so similar... but somehow that is not the case. I still adore them.
 
4: Sony MDR-605 (modded):
--Extremely listenable. Not the most detailed or precise thing, but pleasant sounding with a lot of air and a nice presentation. This would be my go-to budget recommendation if it wasn't so damn rare.
 
5: Audio Technica ATH-6D (modded):
--I'm starting to realize these aren't anything even remotely special... the soundstage is okay, but that's about it. Needs more treble and more detail. Very cloudy and murky sounding.

1. HiFiMan HE-5LE - New toy syndrome? I don't know but the minute I put them on I was in awe. Had a chance to compare a friend of a friends HE-500 and liked these slightly better. Wish they were still made.
2. Sennheiser HD650 - Very solid performer but prefer the LE's by a fairly large margin.
3. Shure SRH940 - My closed headphones for outside. Build quality is suspect IMO.
4. Ultrasone HFI-580 - First headphones bought, got them at a good price so I can't complain. Rarely use them anymore because I'm not into their sound signature as much as I once was.

Cool.
I just did an A/B with the HD7 and 668B and the difference is in a slightly bigger 'body' to Adele's voice and a step towards the mic, but soundstage and the rest remains the same.
For a SL and SL OEM it's on the top end of that line of drivers and design. The best or nearly so.
The entire SL/OEM line is good, but you are correct in that it's just improvements within that frame and no farther. Only so far to go.
It's a very good $36 hp, but if you want BETTER then you are on the right track.Edited by marone - 3/2/14 at 6:26am .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

Bigger body and Adele in the same sentence. Pun intended?  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I guess it's time to update my list, since I've sold or traded away most of my collection since the last round.
 
1. Koss ESP/950
This has been my absolute favorite all-rounder since I first got it, and is the only headphone in my collection I've never really considered selling. Though build quality is a bit shoddy, the sound signature of this classic Koss combines all the best aspects of a 'stat with the warmth and involvement of the HD650.
 
2. Sennheiser HD650
Speak of the devil, here comes my favorite dynamic headphone under $1000. While I've heard an Alpha Dog and acknowledge that it's technically better, the warmth and intimacy of the HD650 is more in tune with what I like to hear. My pair hasn't hit the hundred hour mark yet, so I only expect it to get better
 
3. Mad Dog V3.2
My go-to headphone if I need something closed. About the same level of resolution as the HD650 (except when driven by a high-end rig, in which case the HD650 has an edge), but imaging isn't quite as accurate and bass doesn't have quite the hit.
 
4. Denon AH-C400
A versatile, fairly neutral IEM with top-notch build quality. Portable casual listening bliss, no amp required.
 
5. AKG K67
A bright, sparkly portable for those times when I don't want something in my ears. Much more resolving than you would expect from a DJ headphone, and actually a bit bass light for my tastes.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



How can I not! They have all of the best parts of all of the headphones I sold but I can listen to them all at once. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Stax SR-5 NB - this is my current favourite and will probably stay at the top for long...
Pro: Not so treble focussed as some other STAXen, fast and great stage, bass not too shy for a STAX
Contra: Needs stax or power amp and/or energizer - so not quite mobile, bass could be stronger at times, open back so no insulation
 
2) Etymotic HF2 - current mobile favourite
Pro: Neutral and revealing, great insulation
Contra: Bass not too strong but easy to equalize, dangerous in traffic due to high insulation, takes getting used to the deep insertion
 
3) AKG 240 Sextett MP
Pro: Fun to listen to, magic for voices and guitars, Punchy but not too deep bass
Contra: not neutral at all, rolled off high treble and rarely funny ringing, needs an amp
 
4) AKG 141 Monitor
Pro: more neutral than Sextett, but not totally neutral (or rather lifeless) like K240 Monitor
Contra: On ear design hurts after an hour or two
 
5) Beyer DT990
Pro: Moar Bass!
Contra: not neutral at all, treble hot, mid shy
 
6) Koss Porta Pro - only used on the road when eties are not an option - should mod 'em
Pro: good value for money, modding potential
Contra: stock bloated bass, stock treble shy
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



This might explain its current popularity. Older enthusiasts want to buy something from their youth and don't have the high treble hearing to worry about. Magic midrange also something middle aged enthusiasts tend to seek. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Uh actually the Sextett is popular simply because it's a very good headphone.
 
The KOSS 4AA was far more common among the mainstream population than the Sextett, but it doesn't see nearly as much praise nowadays because it's not all that good by today's standards. The Sextett however, is.

Does someone here has or had the Sennheiser HD700 and the AKG Q701, and can shed some light on differences and similarities ?
thanks!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The hd700 is one of the most boring phones I heard imo (sry to those who likes it). Akg q701 is great, but a bit bass shy and the treble is a bit too much for my ears. Try get some listening time if you can  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Oh no,
The Q701 has the perfect amount of bass to my ears.. sometimes even a bit much :)
(i'm used to the Etymotic ER4s)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


... You found the HD700 boring but the Q701's treble was "too much"? The hell is wrong with your ears? 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Maybe easy on the attitude mate.
The HD700 treble ain't giving me headache, but the q701 does.
And it feels like HD700 ain't got a personality, which the Q701 got.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Full Size/Over-Ear
1. Sennheiser HD600 - I almost never use this one but when I do...wow.
2. Shure SRH840 - Tied with the Amperior because both are very quick and balanced (to my ears). I just recently realized how much I liked neutral sound signatures with minimal reverb but I pick one of these two depending on the situation.
2. Sennheiser Amperior
4. Audio Technica AD700X - Dedicated gaming headphones.
5. Ultrasone PRO550 with PRO750 pads and PRO900 straight cable - I've had this pair for a really long time, and I've spent a lot of time gaming with this headphone and listening to EDM.
IEM
1. Sennheiser IE80 - For whatever reason, I like how "organic" the IE80 sounds compared to the Westone UM3X
2. Westone UM3X RC - I love listening to this when I travel (fly). Great isolation for an universal in-ear.
3. Meelectronics M6 - My dedicated running pair because of how cheap they are and how much bass they can produce even when running.
4. Meelectronics M-Duo - Kind of a V-shaped sound signature with mids missing in some cases. Takes some getting used to.
5. Meelectroncis M9 - Heavy bass is heavy. I used to like this pair a lot and because it was so cheap, it just made sense to get one of these, too.Edited by RallyMaster - 3/14/14 at 9:28am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



That's probably the lower treble glare bothering you on the Q701. I didn't really have issues with the HD 700s treble either, I agree it being lacking in character. I found the HD 800 brighter and more fatiguing than the HD 700. It also lacked character like the HD 700. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I wont get into detail here, but I have had both. My K702 and Q701 were eventually replaced with the K702.65. They both have their place in my stable. Both are great cans, but I prefer the HD 700 over the Q701 for most purposes except where I need a little more depth in my soundstage. I think that's the only aspect where the Q701 is better than the HD 700 for my tastes.

Really? I'm particularly interested in hearing what about the HD600 you like over the HD700. I also own the 700 and 650. My HD650s are my old favorites, they were my go to for over 2 years and I still love them, but I was absolutely blown away with the HD700s (when I finally paired them with the right equipment); there are specific songs I would still prefer to listen to with the 650 over the 700, but I just love the soundstage, detail and imaging of the 700s (but love the bass and warmth of the HD650).
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'll give you an answer without getting too technical here. It's real simple for me. My last updated had the HD 700 as my favorite and above the HD 600, but that was also because I had not owned the HD 800 yet. Because I'm finding the HD 800 does just about everything better than the HD 700, the HD 700 has moved way down in rotation and the HD 600 has moved up.
 
It's less a message about the HD 700 being poor, because it definitely is a great can, and more about the HD 800 being so damn good.

And what pairing is that? I'm curious. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I think I get it: Is it like before you got the HD800, the HD700 was (and is still) the better overall headphone than the HD600 AND different in term of soundsignature; but once you got the HD800 you felt the HD800 and HD700 are similar headphones in terms of overall sound signature, but the HD800 is just better in every way?
 
So although the HD700 is the better over all can between it and the 600, because the HD800 is similar to the 700, but just so much better, the HD700 doesn't really serve a purpose anymore, while the HD600's sound signature is different enough from the 800/700, that it actually has become more useful than the HD700?
 
Correct me if I'm wrong? If that't the case, I can totally understand what you mean.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I am absolutely ape **** over the UberBifrost DAC + Schiit A2 Amp + HD700 combo. The HD700 seems to pair well with Schiit products period. I also own a Loki for the occasional DSD listen and I use a Magni amp at my office, and sometimes I bring in my HD700. When the 700 is running off these products, the results really are spectacular. Actually all my headphones (all Sennehiser) sound awesome on these products.
 
However, my other Senns usually sound good with anything. For example, my HD650s sound awesome even running off a FiiO E9 (which is what I had before the Magni), and even the E12 or the X3 on high gain can run them well (HD650s only require lots of power). My Momentums sound good running off the X3 on its own or with the E12. My Amperiors sound awesome with ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. The HD700s sound like crap running off all that (except when I use the X3 as a DAC with my laptop and run it line out to the Magni), but eclipse the sound of all my other cans when running off Schiit ****.

Soon I will have the Shure SE846. I guess it will be battling out with my Shure SRH 1840 for the top spot.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I guesse since i "technically" own all of these right now:
1. HIFIMAN HE-500- more organic and real than hd700, although not clearly a step above in my opinion.
2. SENNHEISER HD700- more comfortable and does some things better than the he-500, but just not quite enough to take the #1 spot.
3. JH AUDIO JH13PRO FREQPHASE- As good as an iem can get in my opinion. Overall more refined and possibly technically better than the he-500 and hd700, the magic of the full size soundstage puts these 3rd.
4. HIFIMAN HE-400- very similar to the HE-500, but upper midrange dip makes it sound like somethings missing when a/bing the two, and the tizzy treble can be harsh. Alpha pads do wonders for these issues though.
TIE: MR.SPEKERS MADDOGS- more organic and real sounding than the he-400's but can be slightly congested at times, less impactful than he-400.
5. JH AUDIO JH5PRO- somewhat veiled and a bit thin compared to the jh13.

What do you like about the 225 that makes you rate it higher than the 325?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Mostly the comfort but the 325is I have are moded for more bass (vent mod) and they are a bit too loose in the low end compared to the 225s. These are my second pair of 225s and they sound a lot different than my first. A lot more full and rich and the detail in the bass amazing. I'm going to eventually try to reverse or partially reverse the vent mod on the 325 to see how they sound. I think 4 holes are vented right now. I think 2 would be better.
Edit: I should clarify that the reason I find the 225 more comfortable is due to the lighter weight and because the 225 came with a turbulent labs headband.Edited by bassboysam - 3/15/14 at 5:54pm

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: Sony DR-Z7: Simply sublime, a perfect fit for me. Insanely precise transients, extremely clean and free of decay problems, ruthless bass slam and punch, great frequency response. Close to neutral but a little bright up top. Not at all restricted down low; goes down to the absolute extremes of human hearing with no trouble whatsoever. Lacks bass bloom almost entirely. Very pretty, incredible build quality. Extremely good but very uncomfortable for long term (>2 hour) listening sessions and a bit restricted on soundstage performance. Somewhat high THD. These are my "fun" headphones and they see the most use, and this is without a dedicated amplifier. The specifications on these headphones imply that they're hard to drive... I cant wait until I get an amp to suit them.
 
2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Equally as great as the Z7 but an entirely different flavor. Slightly faster and more revealing. Downright incredible soundstaging and razor flat frequency response all the way up to 20kHz. Very easy to drive; sounds great out of anything. Gorgeous, lots of metal but slightly fragile compared to the Z7. A bit less clean overall and lacks the ridiculous slam and punch of the Z7. Also not very comfy for long term use, but for a different reason. Despite being half the weight of their predecessor they are still quite heavy and my neck complains after about 2 hours of use. They also don't play nice with glasses-wearers. The only reason these rank lower is because they see less use; they are just as competent if not even a tiny bit moreso due to the soundstage and lower THD. 
 
3: Audio-Technica ATH-6D: Literally the most comfortable headphones I've ever used, bar none. Extremely light with very low clamping force, a suspension headband, and extremely soft and breathable pads. Sound is great, a bit muffled and lacking extension extremes but very open sounding with a good soundstage and competent transients. Also gorgeous, but unfortunately not the most trustable build-wise. Used primarily for gaming since everything else I own manages to harm me in some way with long term use.
 
Don't have anything else that sees use at the moment; I lent most of my gear to a friend and Tyll from InnerFidelity is currently measuring my Z6 and Z7.
 
Cheers.

zazex, do you think that the 712 worth upgrading from the 702?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Yes - if you've got a solid AC powered amplifier, and listen to lossless files
(and or CD's/vinyl).
 
I'll note here that I recently picked up a new set of K702's, made in China -
the K702's I had about a year ago were made in Austria - and the new ones
(from memory) sound better to me than the older ones.  The build quality is
virtually identical, and they seem to have more bass, a softer yet fully detailed
high end, slightly less soundstage, and a more coherent, stable presentation all
around.  All for $225 or so.
 
What I'm suggesting is that the "new" K702 may be enough improvement for
many over the "old" K702,  
 
But still, the K712 outdoes even the new K702.  In a quite subtle way it's a
spectacular headphone.  As long as there's enough juice behind it IME.
An ALO National, JDS O2, or similar large portable just won't cut it with
the K712's.  Again, IME.

It's the pads.

Right, sorry, my mistake.
 
The pads attenuate the treble slightly and absorb some of the bloom from the bass. It is not a major difference by any means.

If you have a larger head and the NADs are beyond your budget, then the AKG K550 or K545. I haven't heard them but from extensive reading, they're bound to end up on that list, along with the German Maestro GMP 8.35, Beyerdynamic DT1350, DT250, SoundMagic HP100, Sennheiser Amperior, HD25s.

The HD700 is a horrible headphone, avoid it like the plague. 
 
Don't be so sure about the HD800. Its slightly darker than the K701 and is an absolute beast to power. The K701 is an extremely underrated headphone. It seems like it gets kicked to the dirt simply because it's cheap relative to the other flagships. It does a lot of things right and very few wrong. You'll be hard pressed to find a headphone that's a complete, direct upgrade to it. In fact, the only headphone that comes to mind is the STAX SR-009. 
 
The K812 might be worth a try if you can deal with a little tizz on the transients; it has deeper bass, higher treble, better soundstage, etc while maintaining the transparency of the K701, but sacrifices some treble control and refinement.
 
If you're willing to go vintage, the STAX SR-X MKIII is a good complement to the K701, according to my friend. Just make sure you replace the pads else you'll be left with a very bright, bassless experience. You would also need either a transformer box and a speaker amp or a normal bias stat amp, so that'd be more of an endeavor.
 
Hope this helps.

Woah. A bit harsh there, though I think much the same.

I try being polite and subtle, but people don't seem to listen very well when I do that. So, blunt and harsh it is. 
 
On-Topic: Updating my list... 
 
1: Sony DR-Z7: Does almost everything right for me, I really love these.
2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Everything the Z7 can't do, these do at the same level. A perfect complement.
3: Pioneer SE-500 (modded): God why can't obsolete this headphone? Horrid comfort and brightness aside, I still enjoy it... a lot. 
4: Audio-Technica ATH-6D (modded): Perfect comfort. Balanced and expansive, used for gaming.

Stuff that's currently with me:
Hifiman RE-600--It's not technically the greatest, but there's something about the sound signature that gets me to keep listening
ZMF T50RP V1--This one's a loaner that's been upgraded. They're fantastic, but I like the sound signature of the RE-600 more.
ZMF T50RP V2--I have a review up for them that summarizes my thoughts; they're pretty close to my ideal sound signature, but I tried more things because I'm an idiot and now they're not enough for me.
Sennheiser HD580--My pair was actually kind of bright. The midrange was great, but the sound was a little too forward for me. I just sold these off to a very lucky man.
AKG Sextett MP--I'm pretty sad I'm letting these go, but they're going to someone that would appreciate them far more than I would. They have a magical midrange, but I want a little more treble than these have.
DUNU DN-1000--I'm still trying to find the time to write a review for these. I really like them for electronic music, but not much else when I have the RE-600 to use.
Grado SR80--I don't know why, but I'm really liking them paired with my amp and holed comfy pads. They're not as forward as with the bowl pads and aren't as grating as other Grados I've tried.
Audio Technica W1000X--I didn't like the sound signature at all. I was about to sell them until one of the drivers went kaput, so now I'm going to experiment with them with W5000 drivers.
ACS T15--They're supposed to be neutral, but they sound a little off to me. Still, they're a step above the stuff below them for technical accuracy. Shame they sound pretty boring though.
Beats Pro--I don't really know why I brought them, but they're my guilty pleasure headphone. They don't really do much right, but for electronic they're entertaining.
Brainwavz HM9--They're better than the M50, but not as good as the Beats Pro. Typical V-shaped sound signature. They're quite comfy and they make a really nice headphone to loan out because they have a really inoffensive sound signature.
Narmoo R1M--I'll have a review out soonish (maybe...). They're an upgrade to the former tunable ported IEMs. For $30, they're a steal.
Velodyne vFree--They were free and bluetooth. The sound signature's definitely consumer friendly, but I've heard worse...and they were free.
Sennheiser HD201--They're okay. I leave them around for certain people to borrow because I don't want them using my nicer stuff because they're clumsy
 
Wow, I have a lot of headphones in my dorm.

wow. i heard the HD800 and the Q701 and i wondered if this really worth the money... at first i thought it's because the amp that i used with the HD800, but now you make me wonder...  
 
so if i just stay with my Q701, is it worth upgrading the amp im using right now? (got the Lovely cube) or just stay like this...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Lovely cube is a clone of the black cube right? In that case, that amplifier is amazing! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


While I agree with you that the K701 is an incredible headphone does not get enough respect around here, the HD800 (and the T1) is in whole different league.  You have to own them to truly appreciate them...a quick audition in a noisy store or meet does not do them justice.

I've yet to order the drivers (I sent an email asking if the drivers are matched but never got an answer, but I'm waiting just in case they ever get to it) but I'll definitely document it when I do!

Funny, out of a vintage amp I thought the HD700 was extremely good.  I would buy it for about $500 without a doubt.

Aedle VK-1 (still my favourite pair)
Sportapro (light, comfortable and sounds fairly good)

Heh. Except that the HD 700 is the complete opposite of horrible. Seriously, it's about the most polarizing can around here. People either love it or hate it and just like anything people hate on the internet, it's usually an exaggerated voice from a smaller or what I perceive to be uninformed crowd. I'm sure there are the people that have lived with it and hated it, but not many. I'm not here to invalidate people's impressions. Just keep in mind it's a polarizing can. That being the case, any one interested in it should grab them and make up their own opinion. Mine is that it's well worth the current asking price.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

it blows my mind how much hate the hd700 gets. While i haven't heard the q7xx or hd800, i've heard the hd700 against the he-500 and he-400 and while it is abit of a different flavor, it is a great, world class headphone. To say it is terrible and horrible is a gross and wildly misleading comment.
I find that people that dislike the hd700 are usually comparing it to the hd800 and using the hd800 as the reference to hold the 700 to. but the 700 isn't supposed to be a cheaper-but-as-good hd800. the hd700 is the hd700. If it were the sennheiser flagship and the hd800 didnt exist, we would hear a very different conversation.
If people dont like the hd700, and even hate the hd700, that is ok and there is nothing wrong with voicing that opinion, but hating the hd700 and saying that it is a terrible hp are two very different things. Respect the subjectivity of this hobby and use your vocabulary accordingly. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Judging by how incredibly close the HD800 and K/Q701 measure, I highly doubt this. The T1 is great if you can get a good pair (and deal with the 10kHz peak) but Beyer's QC is inexcusably lenient, making it very easy to get a bad pair. I've owned 3 DT1350s and they all sounded wildly different, and two of them sounded like utter **** compared to the good pair.
 
Regarding the Lovely Cube, if it is a Lehmann Black Cube clone, you definitely don't need an upgrade.

The HE-400 and HE-500 are not world class headphones. The HE-500 is close but not quite there.
 
The HD700 is just a bad headphone, it measures bad and sounds bad, not just relative to any headphone in particular. Its treble is peaky and its got absolutely nasty ringing at 5kHz. It's painful to listen to. The K/Q70x wipes the floor with it, as does the HD800.

Beg to differ.  Owned the K701, K702 and Q701.  Currently own the HD700.  I'd take the HD700 any day over the AKGs (and I did genuinely enjoy the AKGs while I had them).
 
Get the HD700 at the right price and (to me) it's a value proposition.
 
We get that you don't like the HD700 takato.  You've made your point.  How about leaving it at that and let the rest of us enjoy it

I kid, I kid. It's your head and your opinion, and I respect that. I'm still going to refute it and if anyone asks for a suggestion, the HD700 is not going to be it.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

case in point: previous 2 posts.
Like i said, in my opinion its fine to voice if you hate a hp, just dont say its terrible or horrible. Those are two different types of statements. one is implying a subjective opinion while the other is implying an objective fact.
Also, world class heaphones are designated by many factors and the classification itself is also very subjective. BUT hd700 and he500 are classified as "summit-fi" and "high-end", and while they may not boast the technical abilities of the hd800, sr007/sr009, lcd3/x, he90, abyss, i think that they both fill an ackward spot where they are not the highest of hi-fi but still better than mid-fi cans. I'd call that some where in world class, hifi, summitfi, just not quite at the very top like the previous listed models.
I would agree that the he-400 is securely in the mid-fi category, though.Edited by kernel8888 - 3/18/14 at 3:03pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Perfectly fine with that.  Interested to know though - how long did you actually spend with the HD700 forming that opinion - or did you simply read Purrin's graphs and make a decision based on those ........ ?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


SR-90? What IS that?
 
Well objectively the HD700 is worse than the Q701 and HD800. It measures worse. 
 
I realize world-class is subjective. To me Summit-Fi and World-Class means there are no outright flaws. You get everything, you're not compromising performance anywhere, you're not giving up bass to have cleaner treble, you're not sacrificing decay cleanliness for soundstage size. There is no "but"; the headphone doesn't have anything you can fault it for, it doesn't have great transients but crap soundstage, or great bass but crap treble.
 
The HD700 can be faulted for the double penetrator of death in the treble (5k and 11k peaks), so it's not world class. The HE-500's distortion is too erratic (poor power handling) and its treble rolls off a bit. It would be world class if the HE-6 didn't exist.
 
Regardless: If you like the HD700, more power to you. I love my Sony DR-Z7, even though most people think it's a bright, aggressive, bassless clamp machine.

I’m getting sucked in to an internet battle... oh well this will be my last post.
He-90 Orpheus. My bad.
So you say "To me Summit-Fi and World-Class means there are no outright flaws. You get everything; you're not compromising performance anywhere" "There is no "but"; the headphone doesn't have anything you can fault it for, it doesn't have great transients but crap soundstage, or great bass but crap treble"
I have 3 problems with that.
1. Doesn’t exist in an objective context. Not even the HE-90, sr009, or abyss. Probably never will.
2. You then say that if the he6 didn't exist than the he500 would be world class, implying that your opinion of world class is based on price and flagship status, or else the he500 would be included in the world class category regardless of the other more expensive phones in the lineup. Either the he500 is world class or it's not. That’s like saying if the hd800 didn't exist the hd700 would be world class. Your opinion of world class is now proven contradictory beyond repair.
3. Many like the hd700 more than the hd800 and the he-500 over the he-6. Graphs don't indicate interpreted sound and refinement.Edited by kernel8888 - 3/18/14 at 3:02pm

Well, I had a K702 and I loved it.  I bought a T1 just to see what the fuss was all about...and I never used the K702 again (except to compare the two models).  The difference was not night and day, but there was a very noticeable improvement with the T1 (lets say a dusk and day difference).   There was also a noticeable difference (but to a much lesser degree) between the HD800 and the T1 - the Sennheiser simply outperformed the T1 in a couple of areas.    I guess I was lucky because my T1 was incredible.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


1: The 009 is very, very close to objective perfection, but that's not the same thing as having no glaring flaws. I simply mean a headphone that performs at the same level across the board; there isn't one thing it does best, it's simply one collectively excellent experience. 
 
2: My point is the HE-500 is literally a downgraded HE-6; HiFiMAN made the HE-500 by altering the design of the HE-6 to make it cheaper and easier to power. My statement has no bearing on price. If you consider anything around the performance of the HD800 to be world class, then I suppose the HE-500 does belong up there, but I don't consider it world class simply because the HE-6 does everything it does, but better. And no, the HD700 wouldn't be world class unless we were still in the 1980s, and even then it'd only be the best dynamic available. The Stax SR-X MKIII and Fostex T50v1 would wipe the floor with it.
 
3: I have never heard of anyone liking the HE-500 more than the HE-6, nor the HD700 over the HD800 when they're all driven to the extents of their potential.

Enough with the objective nonsense. You're just making your case look weaker every time you bring it up. Objectively, the HD 700 is built of plastic, metal, and silicon. Subjectively, they sound great to me for the price and I own the HD 800.

So far my experience has shown that the only headphones that sound good to me, are the ones that measure good. Sorry if I'm hesitant to trust other peoples ears when every single headphone I've bought based on a direct suggestion from someone else has sounded poor to my ears. 
 
That includes my TH600 and RP18. And my DT1350. And my SA3000. My friend's RS2i sounded pretty awful too. And guess what? All of these measure bad in one way or another. Maybe with one or two headphones it could be coincidence. But five? My faith that measurements don't matter falters a bit.
 
I'm having my favorite headphones (Sony DR-Z7) measured so maybe my mind will be changed by that. We'll see.

Measure good, measure bad, yada yada yada. Whatever the hell that nonsense means, if anything at all. How about relying on your own ear or your own impressions or your own sense of exploration to figure out what you like and don't like. Better yet, how about sharing your own original impressions with the community instead of just saying, "it measures bad?" I'm detecting an extreme lack of self responsibility here. Here's a thought. It's your fault you decided to trust other people or measurements to decide what you bought and didn't like.
 
TLDR over the last several pages: This place is a good community to help point you in the right direction, but don't be afraid to try things and discover your own original preferences. Measurements mean nothing. Your ears mean everything.

Actually, I'm expecting them to measure quite badly. They have their flaws and I'm already very aware of them, and I expect the measurement sheet to reflect what I hear.
 
My main goal is to get a feel for their frequency response to help determine my upgrade path, as everything I've tried so far has left me dissatisfied. I'm happy with them sonically and I'm going to keep them forever, but the problem with that is they're so uncomfortable that I can't stand to wear them for more than 2 hours at a time. Their soundstage is also very small; not necessarily a problem, but I do lust for some more size every now and then. 
 
Though, Sony's marketing for these was centered around the "fact" that they measured better than the world's best speakers at the time of their release, so perhaps they will measure good. 
 
Okay now back on topic with non-lazy descriptions:
 
1: Sony DR-Z7
--I've said before and I'll say it again: A perfect fit for me. Slightly bright with razor flat bass and extremely natural sounding transients. Lacks harshness entirely; the absolute cleanest treble I've ever heard. Has a sharp, clean definition to every note; percussion snaps like a whip and guitars are meticulously defined. Has a wonderful sense of impact not only in the bass but throughout the entire frequency range; the most engaging headphone I've ever used. Built like a tank; almost the entire headphone is made of aluminum. Gorgeous. Downsides are a small, slightly squashed soundstage that can cause details to bleed into each other and a relatively high amount of second-order THD (thickness). Oh, and they inflict physical harm to my ears after 2 hours of use. 
 
2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II:
--Frighteningly overdesigned for their time period and extremely good sounding. Angled pads and transducers, dual suspension headbands, self-locking headband adjustments, extremely thin diaphragm, and very light compared to most gear from their time period. Basically, everything the Z7 doesn't do the best, these do amazingly well. Very flat sounding with insanely good treble extension. Sublime soundstaging that rivals and sometimes even beats open headphones. Has this remarkable sweetness to the highs that's impossible to describe; it's silky smooth and soothing yet very precise and clear. Simply beautiful to behold, both on and off the head.Not as clean as the Z7 and has a bit of bass bloom, but not a lot. More comfortable than the Z7, but still a bit too heavy for my neck. Build quality isn't very trustable; mostly constructed using plastic and glue. The driver magnets can break loose from the transducer; avoid anything that would involve these being banged around at all costs.
 
3: Pioneer SE-500 (modded):
--I just don't know with these. These were literally the third headphones I ever bought. They clamp, they're stupidly hard to power, they have virtually no bass at all, and yet... I love them. They're so bright, but it's done oh so very well. It's got some of the silky smoothness of the Monitor 10 and Monitor 10-II, and a very out-of-head soundstage. Very fast but a bit sloppy in the decay. Thin pads, unpadded headband. Horrid cable and my pair is starting to develop shorts in the headphone. I think I hear a resonance somewhere in the treble, but for some reason I'm not drawn to it as I am with other headphones. Peculiar that these have been around so long and still haven't been obsoleted.
 
4: Audio Technica ATH-6D:
--Relatively unremarkable on the sonic front but well-balanced and competent enough in the transient department. Kind of mid-centric. However, the soundstage is huge and airy and they are quite literally the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. Very light plastics and extremely soft, breathable pads. Suspension headband with very low clamp. Very easy to drive. I use them primarily for gaming but I do wear them outside on occasion when I need to be aware of my surroundings. Very pretty; their design has an eerie resemblance to the Z7.

OK.  I'm new to this, but so far:
 
1.  Sennheiser HD600
2.  HiFiMan HE-500
3.  Klipsch X-10
4.  Superlux 668B
 
I just burned in the HE-500.  I hear a distortion in high mids on some female background vocals.  I'm trying to figure out if it's the headphones or my Lyr/Bifrost.  Otherwise, I think they sound great.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Not all people have the means to try whatever headphones they want. I'm poor and I have no way to get to Head-Fi meets. I only have what I can access on the internet to go off of when I'm making a new headphone purchase. That includes others' subjective impressions as well as objective measurements and data sheets.
 
And I'm sick of people talking down measurements. Sound is a SCIENCE. Things sound good for a REASON. Measurements can REVEAL that reason. 
 
"Its my fault that I decided to trust other people": Damn right it is. People are ******* retarded. I was certain that this time I'd be wrong, surely if I buy a headphone a lot of people like I'll be happy this time, surely an expensive headphone from a highly experienced and well-respected audiophile brand would actually be good, regardless of how it measures.
 
Guess what headphone I'm trying to sell now. Guess what headphone I never even remotely enjoyed listening to. I'm done using anything BUT measurements when looking at new headphones from now on. The closer a headphone is to objective perfection the more it steps out of the way and simply lets you enjoy the music. Anyone who says anything that contradicts objective measurements is listening to the headphone, not the music. It's 90% of the community and it makes me sick. 
 
I'm done here.

Sorry in advance - and not meaning to antagonise or anything (genuine question) ...... relates to me earlier question which you didn't answer .......
 
Based on what you wrote above - have you actually heard the HD700, and how much time did you spend with it - and under what conditions?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
No need to apologize; it's a legitimate, reasonable question.
 
No I have not. I wanted to buy one a while ago but I have held off because of the reports that say their treble is harsh. I've found that poor treble is a dealbreaker for me ever since I got the Z7.
 

 
The measurements suggest this as well. It hurts just to LOOK at that 5kHz peak. However, the rest of it is quite clean, so I'd like to at least try it at one point. Am I going to drop $1k on it just to find out? **** no.

My beloved HD600s have been bested.
 
1) Shure SRH1540
2) Sennheiser HD600
3) Beyerdynamic DT900/600 ohm
 
Other assorted stuff in my collection doesn't come close.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



 
Thanks - and I appreciate your honesty.
 
Can I suggest then - that you can't really say this with any authority .......

 
...... simply because realistically you have no idea how it actually sounds.  I might also suggest that whilst graphs can be helpful in interpreting what we hear, they shouldn't be used to tell us what we hear before we've actually heard it.  All that does is add bias before we audition anything.  Another headphone that was widely maligned on release was the SRH1840 (because of graphs).  A lot of people who've spent time with them would also tell you that if you like a very flat/neutral headphone - the SRH1840 is wonderful.  Essentially a flatter HD600 with better imaging.  In fact at current pricing (sub 500), the SRH 1840 would actually be one of my recommended buys.  I wish I still had mine (sold it to buy the RS1's - which I liked, but in the end did not really "wow" me as much as I thought they would).
 
I've only had the HD700 a couple of weeks so far - but I really do like them.  Yes there is a spike - but it can be EQ'd out (I don't, but it's easy to do).  If you're overly treble sensitive they might not suit.  But they are not horrible headphones - far from it IMO.  And I see used pairs going at sub $600 (saw one pair last week at sub $500!) which actually makes them a pretty good buy.
 
All I'd suggest is that maligning a headphone (which you've never heard) because of a graph is actually a pretty ill-informed thing to do.  Better to say nothing until you've had the chance to actually hear them.  With an open mind - they might even surprise you ......

I tend to judge based on how well they handle my preferred genres and subgenres, though I test with some other genres too.
1. K501 (all classical subgenres except maybe harpsichord, jazz)
2. K340 (piano, vocals, also industrial metal)
3. SR80i (organ, chamber, thrash metal)
4. T50RP (movies, vocals, also black metal)
5. K702 ()
Measurements help me find out what I might like to try and what to avoid buying because I already know which sounds I prefer, such as rolled off bass.
I rely also on the opinions of members whose taste I'm familiar with, whether similar to or different from mine. As long as I can figure out that you have very particular tastes and aren't groping blindly.Edited by Claritas - 3/23/14 at 9:12am

I didn't even think it was that harsh (HD700).
Didn't akg k812 measure quite "badly" for example? People still seems to enjoy it and some people says it's the best dynamic headphone.

http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/hifiman-he-5-he-5le-he-6-and-he500-planar-magnetic-headphones:
 
"I found the HE-6 to have an improved upper mid-range, delivering a somewhat more full-bodied sound than its predecessors. Unfortunately for me, the tizzyness of the HE-5 returned with the HE-6, and I found them a little too bright for extended sessions. I'll add though, that many find these headphones fabulous when match carefully with very good amps.
 
HiFiMAN HE-500 ($899)
Ahhhh … balance! Fang Bian has pushed my buttons with the HE-500, which is significantly more coherent sounding throughout. With these cans, HiFiMAN has retained the strong magnets and field symmetry of the HE-6; gone back to an aluminum conductor; and added special treatments to the diaphragm.
Still slightly too fast, but now with a tamer treble, everything seems better integrated into a marvelously well-balanced presentation. The music blooms clear and whole."
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I think people like Tyll Hertsens put a lot of emphasis on measurements, and while that aids in showing possible sonic flaws, most people will probably never do measurements or assume anything is wrong if the headphones sound good to them....
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



It measures badly, but some hear the problems and others don't. There have also been several defective models and some models sound noticeably different from others.
AKGs have always been my favorites and I've been on the K812 thread from the start, but after all this misadventure, I can wait till I hear it myself. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
he definitely can't say that without any authority and it makes me feel sorry for these type of ppl who pre-judge headphones based on measurements
essentially only a handful of headphones measure extremely well, so i guess +90% are not worth listening to
but meh, go ahead, deprive yourself of a euphonic listening pleasure just because the bass distortion doesn't pass the quoted 1% tolerance limit... it's quite hilarious and sad at the same time
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



This is odd to me. If he'd listened to it and wrote the same thing, suddenly he'd be an "authority" for you? That's precisely why he gave up taking people's opinions so seriously.
So the fire-breather explained himself badly. What do you expect? He's a f****** fire-breather! But his posts about vintage gear are fascinating, and I hope you make an equal contribution someday. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


of course i would take a listeners impressions over measurements, who wouldnt... both are useful in there own rights (for graphs: showing spikes + dips, sibilance blah blah)
but how the hell can you get an overall sonic impression from measurements? i know people who THINK they can interpret a headphone completely from measurements but in my experience, headphones can sound so different from how they measure
 
i find it hilarious how a tascam headphone can measure better than the Abyss, but the Abyss is easily one the greatest listening experiences i've ever had, it's not even remotely comparable... there's some proof right there

I'm with those against measurments. A microphone and a computer is not a person and so how can it tell you what sounds good? A person might like more bass, so any headphone without it sounds bad. Another mighy hate treble, so any headphone with treble sounds bad. Another might love treble, and want more. But if you're a computer, how can you even say what is better? It can just show the frequency response, distortion, etc. pffft what is that worth. If you like bad sounding headphones, how can a graph tell you it sounds good or bad? Like, it could be a perfect headphone, and u could still go; don't like it. How can a computer do that? Or like be really **** headphone, but since you like that exact ****, they are perfect for you. See, computers are flawed, each person is different.
I just wish all people realised that and stopped trying to objectively prove and demonstrate stuff. Like the earth being round.. oh oh they'll show a photo of yhe earth from space and be all like see it's not flat. But that's from a photo. When I look at the earth, it seems flat to me, so who can argue that? For me and others, it's flat, all those who disagree, keep your measurements, graphs and all that to yourself, I'm sick n tired of seeing them. How it should go; does it seem flat to you? Yes/no? Then we can agree or disagree, it's all a matter of opinion in the end. Like, we don't live in a photo, we live on earth which is flat, to us. Nobody lives on a ball where u walk and turn upside down... Ever seen anyone upside down? Bet you not.
Same thing for all knowledge. Nobody knows everything, so why even try. If I don't understand science, how can it work. Headphones aren't science, they are music, an art. Science can't get into audio and tell us what is good or better, or sounds good. Science is of the devil, it's scary and should stay away from music. Because how can we argue if it's measured and we just see it? I mean, can't argue there, but we can't be wrong because that's not an option, so one has to go. And that is science. Go away science! Nobody wants you! We are humans, and we are right, not you. Always. Science knows nothing about good sound.

Agreed, I haven't looked at any measurements when deciding what phones I like. My ears decide what the best headphone is

in short stock galaxy s3 earphones is better > ASG-2  :)
I had high expectation for aurisonics asg2, but I have  heard only disintegrated sound of dynamic driver and its twin balanced armatures.
Lately, a great suspicion is growing in me towards any hybrid designs. Even coherence issue in my Miracles were bothering me, but asg2 was simply disappointment to me. Sorry, but it is.
Sound has this boominess across all frequencies even if put bass tune to the lowest and the treble comes, I do not how to explain it is  like drinking coffee then eating sugar separately :) . It was not so obvious is Miracles, and ASG made it to me very obvious. I do not have really any bias towards dark sounding earphones, but i did not like the implementation
in ASG2.
I have said what I was thinking so long and now you can throw  potatoes to me :) I would not dare to write this in ASG2 thread.

As much as I've liked the IEMs I've owned, they've never measured up with my full-sizers in any way. My W3 and AH-C400 are great as far as casual listening goes, but I'd prefer my MD or HD650 to either of them at home. Maybe customs would change that...

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


At the same price, I've found that IEMs are better than full-sizers, but I'm listening straight out of my laptop and I haven't tried top tier headphones.  Maybe amps are needed or higher tier headphones are needed to beat my IEMs.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It goes both ways, but if what you hear is confirmed by measurements, then it is evidence that what you hear and your interpretation are likely correct.
But placebo works both ways, and your preconceptions of how a headphone should sound might very well influence your perception. Might be measurements, reviews, just the way they look, anything.
Also, have to be careful about interpreting the graphs correctly, which is critical. and lastly, you should look at the data and draw your conclusion from it, and not start with a conclusion and look for data which supports it.Edited by GirgleMirt - 3/19/14 at 11:58am

1) AKG K551 - very comfortable and a sound that suits my listening taste, does sound better from my cMoy.
2) Klipsh X11i - still new to me and very close in performance to the 551, prefer the 551 but X11 are my travel choice sounds Ok from portables, use it with Comply T100s on a plane but this makes the presentation too dark for my normal listening tastes so the single dome silicons sit on there most of the time, my amp is away so not sure how much difference an amp makes
3) Allesandro MS1 - one of my oldest HPs still love it but open backs do not suit my listening habits/environment, also prefers amplification.
4) Shure E2 - up until recently my travel HP, surpassed by some margin by the first 2 on the list, find it tiring when listening for long periods especially on cmoy.
 
Have lots of disposable buds, sport headphones and bits but nothing worth mention.

A Non-audiophile Ranking
 
1. B&W P7: Great and stylish headphones. Unbelievable clarity, the bass is accurate and is also extremely comfortable to wear for long durations. Tested the Sennheiser Momentums, Beyerdynamic T1p, KEF M500 and Sony MDR-7520; the B&W P7 beats all of them. 
I cannot wait to get the FiiO X5 as I was given a demonstration alongside an amplifier, and it generated the most beautiful sound I have ever heard. 
 
2. Apple Earpods: Very good headphones for the price. Yes, I put them above the MF-100. The MF-100's were that uncomfortable!
 
3. Musical Fidelity MF-100: These were just horrible. The clamping pressure was the worst on any headphone I have ever used (including cheap headphones). They were extremely uncomfortable, and I do not recommend them. I had to send them back as they were putting far too much pressure on my ears. As for the sound, it was far from great. Stay away from these headphones. 
 
I am hoping to add more headphones to my collection.

I tested them off of a Burson Conductor and they were definitely fantastic. It actually took two tries to like them because attempt #1 was going in expecting a "bass heavy" headphone and I was really underwhelmed. But going in realizing that it's more of a "full and even" headphone they immediately made my ears smile. Like I said, the reason the M100s will likely stay at #1 is on one hand I just have a real emotional and visceral response to them, plus we're talking $300 vs $900 and I honestly believe price/performance ratio matters.

2. Mad Dog Generation 3.2
 
3. Beyer T51P
 
I've had the Sennheisers the longest, so maybe I just became accustomed and comfortable with their sound.  They are airy and crystal clear and, IMO flawless. 
 
The Mad Dogs are also very nice but I have found one song that sounds just terrible on the MDs and better on the Senns.
 
The jury is still out on the Beyers.  I've had them only a week and can say they certainly they certainly do not lack bass.  I've listened to them through my HM802 and through my WA6 with the computer as the source and fed through the FiiO E17 DAC on the way to the Woo.

Well they are both analytical, resolving and slightly thin sounding closed back headphones with an emphasis on detail retrieval. I know lots of ppl like the 940, they have a following of fans.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Bassically my signature ranks the IEM's 'I own', but the list of what I've owned or demoed (IEM's) would be to time consuming to write down. The best IEM I've heard (still unbeaten) is Tralucents 1Plus2 hybrid with silver/gold cable.. The Shures SHR940 would slot in somewhere between the ER4S (a well amped ER4S) and H-300 in my signature. I run the Shure with DX50 btw on medium gain and I think synergy is very important for the 940 because using them with my Studio V units or Colorfly C3 does not achieve the same results, even though those DAPs (especially the Studios) beat DX50 in other pairings.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



My apologies for reconsidering what I said and editing my post to be more polite. Guess I'll never do that with you again.
 
I know there is a small fan base for the 940 but there are far more people who call it a bright, shrill, plastic-tastic toy. I've seen far more positive reviews of the K550 than of the 940 and I don't have a personal subjective opinion on either headphone. Is it really that hard to believe that someone in my position would be curious or surprised when they read something that contradicts the general consensus?

So you're judging something simply from reading members impressions? You haven't even heard a 940? Then to add trying to base an argument on that? If there's anything you learn in this hobby is never talk about something you haven't heard yourself, because on the opposite side of the fence you would find another party saying the complete opposite about SHR940 to what you 'read'. How about you go and listen to them first. It's members like you who go spilling 'read only' info that skews peoples judgement when looking to buy a headphone.Edited by H20Fidelity - 3/24/14 at 4:18pm

I'm quite interested in the K612 Pros 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
That's rather presumptuous. Please don't pour fuel on the fire.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I wouldn't call it presumptuous at all, if the member hasn't heard SHR940 it's basically an Arthur and Mather affair. he has no leg to stand on simply stating what he's "read," because for every negative reaction there will be a positive. I highly recommend takato14  refrain from speaking about SHR940 any further until he demos them, buys them or listens to them personally. Actually, I believe there's rules in place about "commenting on gear you haven't heard". I wonder if takato14 knows about those. 
 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Actually considering earlier comments in this thread on the HD700 (which takato14 had also never heard), and the manner of the comments on the SRH940 (they suggest to me he's never heard it either), I'd say H2O had justification posting what he did.
 
Although the SRH940 has a brighter upper tilt - there is a certain warmth to that brightness.  The last thing I'd describe it as is shrill.
 
If there is one thing I'd love to see gone from Head-Fi, it's the number of strong opinions from people who've never heard or experienced the gear they're supposedly commenting on.  A year or so ago - even Amos (Currawong) was calling for people to stop doing it.  It helps no-one.

As Brooko would know I'm a pretty easy going guy, but if there's one thing that bugs me is when members start taking for granted what they've read about a headphone or any audio product. To simply concrete something based on impressions (and then try and argue those points with no hands on) is simply what sets this site into confusion. It ruins what this site is about.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
You don't know that and he doesn't either. Regardless, there should be a presumption of innocence and a respectful attitude. And what H20 wrote was neither. Keep it civil.

Actually - I asked directly about the HD700, and he admitted never hearing it and relying on graphs for his opinions.  He also wrote in his earlier post:

 
That reads to me that he hasn't heard either.  Otherwise why would you add it?
 
I also think that H2O was remarkably civil given the circumstances.  I also try to be the same with all my posts.
 
Just providing some explanation and balance - now back to the headphone rankings perhaps .......
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I totally agree with you about the 940 and I've read the same feedback it seems.  I think you were asking a perfectly reasonable question.  I remember you asked me a similar question about my HD590 rankings and I even felt then that you were asking a reasonable question.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



There are couple of reasons.
The first and most important to me is the detail the 940s resolve. The 550s aren't terrible in this department, but they just can't keep up with the Shures. I listen to a lot of country, bluegrass, and rock. I can literally hear every instrument with the 940s. A lot gets lost in the shuffle with the AKGs. Also, I don't find the bass lacking at all on the Shures. If I'm playing a song that's recorded with good bass, then it's there. Just as it should be. It just doesn't override everything else. Also, I find the treble rather enjoyable. To my ears, it isn't harsh, but rather smooth and super detailed. I love it. 
Second is the midrange boost the AKGs have. Sometimes it's just right and a guitar or other string instrument just sings, others it's harsh and annoying. I'm really sensitive to this area. Always have been.
Now, I'm not bashing the AKGs by any means. I really enjoy listening to them. I think the build quality is unsurpassed, and they're one of the best looking headphones on the market. In fact, instead of returning the 550s, my wife may be keeping them.
Keep on mind, these are my opinions and my opinions only. Everyone has different tastes and I respect that. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Hm, interesting. Perhaps I should try the 940s after all. I have had people mistake brightness for harshness/sibilance in the past with some of my gear and I certainly wouldn't be surprised if the Shures are the same way.
 
One other question though, is the build quality really as terrible as people claim? 
 
Oh, and thank you for replying in a civilized and polite manner. Most members could learn a thing or two from you, myself included at times.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I owned them for a while. They're pretty nice sounding cans - but they had a weird notch in the bass that unfortunately over time just didn't quite gel with me. As far as build goes - if you baby them they'll last - but they do have a design fault that can result in cracking around the hinges. The SRH840 were built like tanks. Unfortunately the 940s weren't quite as solid. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Build quality is definitely suspect. Was the reason I originally thought about returning. I had a pair a few weeks ago that were used as a demo set. Both sides had cracks where they mount to the headset, so I've seen the issues first hand. Couldn't find anything I liked better, and ordered a new set. I baby everything I own so I'm hoping that makes a difference. I've even thought about loosening the screws a slight bit where they mount to see if it helps prevent failure. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



It's a good headphone, a bit picky about the amp and source and is quite demanding, but if it has good synergy with a system, it's a real treat to listen to. It's a very linear sounding headphone with very good imaging and the bass extends very deep for an open-back, it's also very textured in the bass and overall sound. The midrange is more forward and intimate than the K7xx series. The treble is quite balanced with the rest of the sound signature, it's not as sparkly as the K701/K702/Q701 though.

They are bright and a bit sibilant, but I wouldn't call them harsh or fatiguing which I find odd considering how bright hey are, it's actually one of the few bright headphones I can tolerate for hours on end. The brightness does tone down a bit and the bass comes more to life with some burn-in, I just got mine a few days ago so I'm curious about how they will end up sounding in the end.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Might wanna stay away from the K812. Knowing AKG they're probably going to release a revision of it that tries to "fix" what their customers don't like about it (a'la K712). I'd go with a Q701 for now.
 
If you want to be spendy, the HD800 is basically a direct upgrade to the Qs, but its that "extra 1% of performance" situation and the HD800 requires a monster amp (read: more $$$) while the Q701 should sound good out of mostly anything.

I've heard both the K812 and HD 800. The HD 800 doesn't necessarily need a monster amp, it needs good synergy. Although like any good headphone a monster amp with a great dac will bring out it's full potential. I found the K812 very good and I thought it sounded better than the HD 800 when both had their full potential brought out. The HD 800 and K812 definitely like different amps though. The Q701, etc. is the point of diminishing returns, but headphones such as the K812, HD 800, etc. are noticeably more refined and it becomes more obvious the better the system.

It depends if the goal is analysis or more casual listening. For the former, HD800; for the latter, HD600. (I haven't heard K812 yet and don't especially enjoy K70x.) Nowadays, in my early middle age, I want to relax and enjoy myself. So I prefer something more rolled off. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



That is true. The K812 mixes both analysis and casual listening very well. The HD 800 is definitely noticeably brighter than the K812, although I wouldn't say the K812 is rolled off.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'm staying away from the AKG K812 until they either drop the price or come with a fixed version. I can wait since these Shure SE846 sound so good :)

Well, that's only one very knowledgeable person's opinion. See also Blackmore's review in the high end forum. I can't say I'm over-fond of K70x and its variants. In general, I think the old firms did their best work ten or more years ago.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Opinion will probably always be split on those, like T1 and Abyss (amongst others). Clearly, K812 isn't destined for the near universal admiration of HD800. But that's where personal preference and listening experience comes in. I'll listen and decide for myself. If the other flagships are anything to go by, I probably won't care about it either way and will continue buying vintage gear by the same firms.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I can say that I loved my friend's Q701 and that it measures extremely well. It's incredibly similar to the HD800. People often make the inference that the Q701 is the K701, but there were changes made. The K701 had some nasty modal breakup around the 2kHz region (lower treble/upper mids). The Q701 doesn't have this issue, making it a lot more transparent. 
 
I haven't heard the K812, but if the measurements are any indication I'd like to buy one and put Q701 drivers in it so I can have the gorgeous/comfy/gloriously constructed shell and the incredibly competent sound, that is unless AKG releases a K912 any time soon.

Minor changes were certainly made, none of which impressed me. That whole series is a departure somewhat from their earlier models, so a lot of fans were disappointed (myself included). The new one seems to depart again in its own way. They're coming out with another next month just to screw delight the fans. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Well put me down for the new model then. 
 
:D
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

A short list. Hopefully I'll be expanding it in the next couple months.
HiFiMan RE-400 - Wow, absolutely amazing for $100. The only flaw in these is their build quality, but this is made up for multiple times with their amazing sound.
V-Moda Crossfade LP2 - Better bass than the RE-400 imo, but that's about it. The more I listen to my RE-400, the more these sound too dark to me. These remain my primary headphone for computer use because all IEMs feel weird in my ears during long sessions, and the LP2 (especially now with XL pads) are just easy to leave on my head and forget about. The RE-400 are very comfortable for an IEM, though.
JLabs JBuds J6 - Got these as a gift a month or so before I got my RE-400. Sound quality is nothing special. The bi-flange tips these come with are super uncomfortable. Only have a couple hours on these things.
I've also owned the Skullcandy Ink'd 2, but those broke long before I had any sort of interest in headphones.

Right, significantly less expensive - and IMO a better sounding, better looking, and more comfortable headphone than the HD 25 1 II.
 
I guess it might not make a whole lot of sense from some perspectives - but Sennheiser knows what they're doing
and I'm sure has their reasons for the current reduced price on the Amperiors.
 
Still, it makes little if any difference to me as the buyer - I'm glad to have the opportunity for a bargain.

Interesting....you have some bass light models and bass cannons on your list.   How do you chose which one to use (mood, music type)?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Yes, mood and music type, but the #1 factor is probably how long I'm planning to listen.  Like, if I'm looking for an interesting, bass-heavy 20-minute listen, the PRO 900 is an awesome choice.  But anyone who has them will tell you that your ears will hate you after a while.  On the other hand, some say that the K550s are fatiguing, but I usually opt for them if I'm going to be listening for a long time.  Great comfort and clarity, well-rounded sound and sufficient bass make for an excellent combo.  The M-100s are slightly weaker in some respects, but the focus on user-friendly mobile use and a certain "wow" factor upon first listening (both missing from the 550s) pushed them over the top.

Most magic:
Sennheiser HD 800 (VERY nice detail, layering, speed and clarity - probably my favourite cans but since they are open I don't always have a chance to use them)
Fostex TH-900 (your music with MSG sprinkled on top, makes music alive)
 
Denon AH-D2000 with Denon AH-D5000 wood earcups (nice, warm and musical - relaxing to listen to)
 
Moderate magic: 
Audio-Technica ATH-W1000X (can be great for vocals and can really get my toes tapping, wood finish is surprisingly durable *cough*)
Beyerdynamic DT250-250 (crisp and open sound; downfall: can be a bit bright without proper amplification)
Ultimate Ears TripleFi.10 (downfall: recessed mids, or prepare to up the volume)
 
Audio-Technica ATH-AD900 (downfall: slightly thin sounding at times, lack of bass, sound leakage - I never really used them, but being my only open headphones at the time they convinced me to try out the HD800)
 
Less magical:
Yamaha HP-1 (very nice imaging and layering)
Yamaha YH-1 (slightly brighter than my HP-1, probably better on paper but hard to say)
 
Koss Porta Pro (downfall: pulls on my hair, possible sound leakage - I actually used these as my headphones on the go for a long time. Very good for the price.) 
 
Ultrasone Pro 900 (great performance even unamped) (no real complaints, might lack treble sparkle/extension)
 
(stock) Fostex T50RP (quite natural sounding; downfall: mids resonance can become fatiguing)

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Get which you want, but man, the Alphas are fantastic on them! So comfortable too.
 
For my D2000, they have a little bit of dampening (Dynamat?) in the cups to help with bass bloat, but mine have plastic cups. With the wooden, you probably wouldn't need it.
 
I would deff get some other pad, the stock aren't best and the improvement is worth the cost!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I find the Alpha pads too thick at the top, so maybe get the Lawtons.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
They are thick, but if you press them down flat when you use them, they will soon lose some thickness. I agree with the thickness being a little bit much at first, but they seem like they are decompressing over time, getting closer to the ideal thickness I'd like.
 
Maybe Lawton pads are even better, I wouldn't know because I haven't tried them.

I haven't tried the Lawtons yet either. The Alphas are very comfortable because they're much cooler against the skin next to the ears than pleather.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Yes, I agree! They are indeed cooler, and smoother/softer on the skin too.
 
Really, if you feel they are too thick (I agree), put the headphone on your head, and push the pads all the way down against your ears a few times. They will lose thickness and sit closer to the ear for the duration of the listen.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Thanks. I'll try that. Other things that work are (1) rotating the pads back a few degrees so they're thinner on top and (2) bending the arms of the headband outward, which puts pressure on the back part of the pads and flattens them a little.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
yes, rotating the pads to the best possible angle helps too.
 
I played around with the angle they face, it changes their fit, which can improve the sound.
 
It's important that the pads sit tight around the ears, so you get that full seal.

Odd, Sextett over both the DF and the Q701? Care to give us some insight as to why?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
The Sextetts he currently has used to be mine, and I'd agree with him at least in terms of signature preference. While they weren't technically amazing (their treble was a bit rolled off), both Sextetts I've had have been some of the most enjoyable headphones I've been able to use because of their fantastic, unabashedly colored midrange. The DF was nice, but didn't really engage me. The K702 I had was pretty good, but I didn't like the upper mids unless I used felt filters.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The Q701 doesnt have the upper mids issue that the K70x series has, though.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Actually it does, just to a lesser degree compared to the older K7xx series. The upper mids on the K/Q7xx series can be rather grating or no issue at all depending on the system. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I like the more forward and engaging presentation of the K1K and sextett. Really I could live with just one headphone overall of any of the top five.
 
 

I agree, The K701/K702 had a bit of harshness that isn't as noticeable on the Q701.

I don't yet own the PM-1, but I had a pair on hand all weekend and plan to add it to the stable soon permanently (or perhaps a PM-2 when it comes out, if it measures up well sonically to the PM-1), so I'll include it in my rankings this time around. As usual, my rankings are based on subjective enjoyment, not all-out technical prowess. I've also included amplifier information if somebody wishes to ask about a specific combo I'm using. The most recent additions are the PAT-4 vintage preamp (the second one I've owned), both pieces of the portable setup in slot #5, and (of course) the PM-1.

GREQ,
What do you like about Momentum?
How would you describe the Sony? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I really like how the Momentum has a rolled-off treble BUT still has enough speed/attack for any genre.
I like how the bass is just slightly bloated, as this ensures it isn't drowned out by the noise outdoors (as usually bass is the first thing we perceive less in noisy surroundings)
I love the fit and comfort. They're tight enough that they dont' fall off or sway around when I'm walking around, and I can easily wear them for hours and forget I'm wearing them.
 
The Sony I would describe as 'unique'. 
Through the right source it is one of the most perfect on-ear headphone I've ever heard (but a little uncomfortable - not as bad as a stock-Grado SR60i).
It has however .... close to no soundstage whatsoever.
The only thing it really misses is some bass texture and low-bass grunt. 
It is focused, fluid and can be very intimate, but still kind of studio-ey.
(The sound through a neutral source is close to unbearable.)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Thanks. I was impressed with how rich a sound Sennheiser was able to coax out of such a small-looking model: it follows the overall sound of HD650. (I was surprised you like the comfort till I remembered your remarks about L-cushions being more circumaural for you--lucky guy!)

By Our Headphones Shall Ye Know Us
 
While I am still trying to figure out how I rank my own headphones, I took a bit of time to analyze the most recent data on this thread.
 
I looked at the data for the past 4 months, which includes 1027 statements of headphone ranking.  I am using this as a small data set to eventually analyze a much larger portion of the data, time permitting.
 
The analysis includes rank orders posted from Nov. 22, 2013 through April 24, 2014.  These postings included:
 
1027 headphones;
154 headphone owners (that averages to 6-2/3 headphones per owner, at least 3x the number of bathtubs per owner -- do we have a lot of unwashed listeners?!! 
548 different headphone models.
 
With 548 headphone models and 1027 headphones, there are a lot of headphone models that only a few folks have... for example, 397 headphone models are listed by only 1 person, and 122 models are listed by two to five persons.  Hence, 519 headphone models are listed by less than 1/2 % of our post authors in that time segment.
 
Looking at the most frequently listed headphones, here are the headphones held by at least 1% of the folks in the sample (i.e. 10 or more people had these):

Each of these headphones was listed by multiple owners as part of a rank order list.  One can compute a relative position of a headphone on a rank order list... for example a Sennheiser HD 800 listed at the top of a list of three might be in a relative position of 0.33, i.e., 33% into the list.  If another person listed that headphone as second in a list of 6, it would be at a normalized position of .33 on that list as well.  In this manner, lists can be combined that rank various numbers of headphones.
 
With at least 10 lists that rank each of these most-commonly-used headphones, we can compute a rank position (closer to 0 if ranked high; closer to 1 if ranked low) as well as a standard deviation.  Here are the same headphones, ranked from "best" scoring (lowest) on down, with standard deviation:

This same information can be presented graphically, ordered from left to right by increasing position down the rank order list:
 

Rank Order Position, with Standard Deviation, of The Most Popular Headphones
 
What is most useful, and I've not yet computed, is how a particular headphone of interest compares to other specific headphones, as ranked by the folks on this thread.  If I am considering a Sennheiser HD 800 (which I am!), what headphones do folks rank ahead of it?  Equal to it?  Below it?  Are there any correlation of a person's ranking of a Sennheiser HD 800 with how they rank other headphones... for example, if they like bass headphones and have ranked Beats Pro relatively higher than most, do they tend to rank HD 800s lower (if indeed there ARE enough people that have both!?)
 
Ideally, my work here will result in a spreadsheet that I can post for all to use that allows one to dial in a headphone of interest and retrieve other headphones compared to that headphone of interest, how they compared, and perhaps even who made the comparison, to allow a note to that person to be sent ("@DrDre, why did you rank the Beats Pro above the Sennheiser HD 800?")
 
As I work further back into the data, the number of headphone models that have enough users to have useful statistical rankings will increase and such comparisons will be possible on more headphone types.
 
OK... back to data entry!

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hello kayandjohn,
 
I had done this kind of statistical analysis myself, when I had spare time on several occasions... mostly at work/college/...
and I chose a starting year of 2012. But it wasn't until a month later that I realized - It doesn't cover the whole story, and never shalt;
 
The problem at point, being that people do tend to like a certain headphone better than another, for more than one reason:
1. A personal taste/preference, whereof the community tried to list "Clubs" as a reference point to taste...-> Bass: bass-heads, Mids: mid-centric, Treble: treble-heads, or just
    Neutrality/balanced .
2. A person using the "wrong" amp. for a certain "power hungry" headphone...(or no amp. at all) - Try using a "little-dot 2" amp. with an HD800...=> the 1/7th priced DT880
    might just sound better (and is). The case is even worse when speaking of certain Orthodynamic-headphones.
3. Diverse songs... What you find yourself listening to more; sometime you prefer Classical music, which for that the HD800 is the best dynamic headphone ever, no argue
    there.. (see "wall of fame" on every respected site). But then, you might prefer Vocal music, and you need  something which sounds "closer" to your ears, with much less
    (yes, smaller!) sound-stage... give it full bodied vocals, more warmth, and have a more "organic color" to the Mids... don't even get me started on metal/fast-rock music...
4. all-in-one / jack-of-all-trades, versus, specialized headphone for each genre; Some people have the will, and have a hold of several headphones and/or amps.
    while others- are in constant search for their "all-rounder" solution... everything is never quite enough. Try watching a YouTube video with an analytical IEM...
 
So, to make this work... the first thing you need to do, is to separate each headphone to its respected category. (for ex. DT880 with K/Q701/2 with Shure ... )
and you certainly cannot put dark and "euphonic" headphone such as the LCD v2, with the Beyerdynamic T1... for they are "opposite" headphones. (et al)
Then, try to "know" the "ranking person"... what his/her tastes are, and if they synergies the "complementary" equipment with it. (for instance: a bright headphone with a warm amp... etc) 
 
Just sharing my 2c,
/Eyal
 
 
P.S
HD598 is NOT better than higher-end HD600/650. sry.
Edited by eyal1983 - 4/29/14 at 3:04pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Oh absolutely eyal1983!  One of the biggest analyses still needed is WHAT a person compares a given headphone to... that is what I  outline in my "further research" comments.
 
Each person's ranking used in the plot rates the headphone against a different list.  Perhaps folks who buy and rate Sennheiser HD 598s have a population of headphones that is generally less capable than folks who buy the Sennheiser HD 600 or HD 650!  That makes the HD 598 stand out in the same way I was top student in my "bonehead" remedial English class.
 
And what I think people really care about is not the rating of a headphone against an indiscriminant population of all headphones, but its rating against headphones vying for the same market, e.g. bass-head headphones, or accurate headphones, etc.
 
That is why my goal is eventually to have a tool that one enters a headphone and then learns both to what other headphones it had been compared, and how it fared in those comparisons.
 
Thanks for your thoughts!

Having heard a lot of these, that definitely sounds about right as far as my ears are concerned.
 
Statistics are fun.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Hehe I agree. And figuring most people don't have the money to drop thousands on headphones it makes sense that neither Stax nor Abyss appear on this list... (Though they should be put in a category similar to "super cars" along with the Sony-MDR R10, HE-60, Orpheus etc.)

2. Sennheiser HD600
Pros
+ Kind of similar in overall signature to the HE500 - but I prefer its air for classical, acoustic yadda yadda...  + Slightly warm and laid back - relaxing  + Great treble that once again is just right for me   + Very comfortable  + Strong soundstaging
cons
- Bass is not as good in extension/tightness as the planars for me
 
3. Hifiman HE400
Pros
+ Rich and deep bass, great for electronic - any more and I don't like it   + Great deep sound to them, and great layering   + more fun and energetic sound sig  + buttersmooth synth sound - maybe because of the dark mids
Cons
- treble is too much for me on anything other than my electronic stuff   - not as remarkably clear as the HE500  - again they are bit heavy, but still comfortable for about an hour
 
4. Mad Dog 3.2
Pros
+ isolate extremely well - no leakage  + Laid back easy going sound signature for those times I can't use the HD600  + very comfortable + second favorite bass after the HE400
Cons
- well extended and fun  - a tiny tad dull at times in the treble for me 
 
My main music is 70s Prog rock, Hard Rock and punk. Also 80s Rock music (Van Halen, INXS, Guns N Roses, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne). 90s Rock and Grunge, also stuff from recent times like Alter Bridge, Clutch, QoTSA etc. Goa, uplifting, vocal and psy trance - IDM, Ambient Electronic, Future pop, Chillout. A bit of softer Indie. Blues, Jazz and acoustic/folk. Lastly but not leastly I enjoy things like softer classical soundtracks, field recordings and highly enjoy NeoFolk music. 
 
I don't listen to aggressive heavy metal sub genres (My heavy limits are like Judas Priest, Grim Reaper, Saxon old fashioned melodic heavy metal) Many heavier styles of electronic, mainstream pop, hip hop or R&B and I don't listen to hardcore punk.

Regarding my post "By Our Headphones Shall Ye Know Us" that performs some statistical characterization of the most recent 1,000 headphone rankings on this thread, referenced here:  http://www.head-fi.org/t/109756/rank-the-headphones-that-you-own/4065#post_10501387 :
 
We have given a rank order position, from 0 (best) to 1 (worst) of the 12 headphone models that are called out at least in 1% of the comparisons (i.e., at least 10 times).
 
However, what I think folks care about more than rank order is how someone who owns several headphones of interest rank orders those headphones. That is what I try to communicate here.
 
More specifically, a person may come to this data with a particular headphone in mind and ask, "How do the people who have this headphone rank it against other headphones?"
 
To that end, I limited my analysis to just these top 12 headphones, ignoring all data on other headphones listed less often.
 
With that restricted population of headphones, I screened the various rank order lists given to only look at the ranking of those headphones.  It turns out that there are 115 rankings of just these headphones to each other... a few users (you know who you are, Eternal Schism, saren, pdrm360!) have five or more of these 12 headphones and provide a useful rank ordering of them.
 
For each of the 12 headphones, I lined up the list of comparisons from each user that ranked it against one or more of the remaining 12 popular headphones.  I lined these up horizontally, with the headphone of interest occupying the same vertical position in each adjacent list, and headphones ranked above it listed, by model name, above it and headphone ranked below it listed below it.  Hence, each list is preserved so that you know WHICH headphones scored better and worse for each user.
 
I also computed an average rank order score (a number from 0.00 to 1.00).
 
Here are the results:
One colored row for each of the 12 headphones, with the headphone of interest indicated in a gray horizontal box for each list;
Longer rows (e.g. first row) have more user rank order lists than short rows (e.g. next-to-last row)
Each vertical list within each row is the list of somebody who expressed a ranking of the headphone of that row;
The headphone that is described in each row is shown in the colored box, along with an average score of its position across all rankings of these 12 headphone models and giving a price (or sometimes, two:  manufacturer's site / Amazon.com site);
and For each user list within a row, the headphone of that row appears in the same vertical position and is connected across the user ranking lists by a gray box
Clearly, you need to click on the image to be able to read it!:
 

 
Interesting things to note include:
 
Sennheiser HD 800 is always placed at the top of whatever list it is compared to, while the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 and Koss PortaPro are always placed at the bottom.
Sennheiser HD 800 has an average ranking far better than the next on the list (Beyerdynamic T 1), which in turn is above a group of the next three that are ranked together (Audeze LCD-2.2, Sennheiser HD 650, and HiFiMAN HE-500)
Sennheiser HD 650 is ranked above the Sennheiser HD 600 three times and below it two times.
 
If one were to characterize each headphone as to "type" (e.g., HD 800 as "balanced," Audeze LCD-2.2 as "warm,"), one might be able to find more correlation in the results... perhaps people rank headphones of their preferred type higher than others.  This is merely conjecture at this point.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Here's another way to look at comparisons of each of the 12 most-frequency-ranked headphones' ranking to each of the remaining headphones... a simplified way of showing the information detailed in my figure above.
 
In this matrix, each headphone appears as the label of both a column and a row.  At each intersection BELOW the black boxes forming a diagonal, each dot at a row-column intersection indicates how many times the headphone that is the COLUMN heading was ranked ABOVE the headphone that is the ROW heading (this is the BLUE section).  For example, the LCD-2.2 was ranked by four people as higher than the HE-500 (red box at lower left points to this).
 
Similarly, for each intersection ABOVE the black-box diagonal (the yellow section), each dot shows an instance of the headphone labeling the ROW as being ranked above the headphone labeling the column.  For example, using the second red pointer-box, one person ranked the HE-500 above the LCD-2.2.
 
So for example, no one ranked any headphone (of these 12) above the HD 800, so the HD 800 column has all the dots and the HD 800 row has no dots.
 
Exercise for the student... which headphone is ranked overall higher, the HD 650 or the HD 600? Explain.
 

Each dot indicates one time that the headphone type at the top of the
column was ranked above another headphone at the left of a row (click
to enlarge).

^^^When I had the HD650 and HD580, I preferred the HD580. I think what your analysis shows is what most of us here know: we all have pretty different preferences. While the HD800 happened to not be ranked below anything else in the previous posts, there are definitely people who would rank the LCD-2 above the HD800, like me in certain situations.

Kayandjohn 
Did you also take into account that some people had only a small amount of headphones, so that a "lame"/"crappy" HP got a "good" rating because of that ?

Funny! Is that 240S a sextett? If so, that makes up for the others :-) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I cannot believe the time I spent trying  to "Rank the Headphones That (I) Own,"  but here goes:
 
Rankings (Sound and Non-Sound) and Criteria:
 
Based on sound quality, from top to bottom (see below for detailed comparisons):
 
Stax SR-5 (with Stax SRD-06 transformer);
Grado PS500;
Sennheiser CX300II earbuds (yes, really!);
Sennheiser HD598;
NAD VISO hp50;
Beats Pro;
Beats Studio 2013 (active noise cancelling);
Beats Studio 2013 Wireless (blue tooth with active noise cancellation);
Parrot Zik (blue tooth with active noise cancellation and iPod app for equalization and sound stage control);
Apple In Ear (the $79 ones with two dynamic drivers, NOT the ones that come with iPhone);
Klipsch S4i in-ear;
Apple Earpod (these ARE the ones that come with the current iPhone);
Sennheiser PXC 310 BT (folding noise-cancelling blue tooth).
 
I find I use these the most:
 
Sennheiser CX300II;
Sennheiser HD 598;
Beats Pro;
Beats Studio 2013 Wireless.
 
What I enjoy in a headphone, which drives these ratings and determines which of the headphones I actually use the most, includes:
 
High frequency capability, manifested as like-live snare drum hits, the ability to tell the pitch of even the lowest bass notes due to preserving its harmonics, and the impression of looking at the music through an open window rather than frosted glass or felt;
Great sound stage with good positional imaging;
The ability for sub bass to be felt as well as heard (hard to do while preserving the treble fidelity I just mentioned);
Convenience for portable (iPod) use - light short cord with remote, comfortable to wear but stays on during motion; plug that fits into my iPhone despite the iPhone case;
Good looks (or at least a unique character, e.g., the retro Grados).
 
Comparing Sound Quality:
 
I've ranked my headphones by conducting a systematic regimen of 10 listening tests for various threesomes of these headphones, in which I rate each headphone as better or worse than the other two on each test (or sometimes, tied!), leading to a rank order position for each test (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
 
I use an iPod 5th Generation source from its headphone output, except for the Stax, which I drove with the speaker output of a stereo rack system to its SRD-6 transformer, as is proper.  No amplifier (other than for Stax) was used (in separate tests, I had convinced myself that the Fiio E-12 Mont Blanc amplifier, using uncompressed high-quality Chesky songs, made no difference).  I used Apple AAC format (256 kb/sec variable bit rate), for which again, separate listening tests convinced me that I could not distinguish from original CD-based full-bit-rate playing.
 
I used four songs:
 
"You're Going To Miss Me When I'm Gone," by Band of Heathens, from their album One Foot In The Ether (used for fidelity of drum sound, positional resolution of two vocalists, and ability to discern pitch of string bass passages);
"Spanish Harlem," by Rebecca Pidgeon, on The Ultimate Demonstration Disc of Chesky records (used to assess female vocals, transparency, the attack of finger on bass string, and high resolution discrimination of differences in shaker shakes);
"Symphony No. 3 in C Minor Op. 78 (Organ Symphony) - IV" by Camille Saint Saens played by Lorin Maazel and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (used to assess the "ripping" sound of well-rendered lower brass and organ reed pipes, and the ability to hear a very small entrance amidst a bombastic chord of orchestra and organ at full tilt);
"Throwback" by B.o.B. on Underground Luxury (used to assess ability of a bass tone, specifically lowest C on piano at about 32 Hz, to pick me up by the throat and shake me!)
 
The 10 tests were as follows:
 
Transparency:  What is between me and the music?  A felt cloth?  A "Sennheiser veil?" A frosted window?  Dirty window?  Clear Saran wrap?  or nothing?  At its best, makes me forget I am listening on headphones and am in room with musicians.
Width of sound stage:  How far to the left and to the right, (yes, AND up and down in best cases) does it seem the musical sources are arranged?
Positional resolution:  Can I distinguish a difference in position of two singers in Song 1?
Bass visceral:  Does the bass in third verse of Song 3 actually shake me? Or do I just hear it?
Drum "twang":  At start of Song 1, do the bass and tom tom drumhead have a tone and a pitch, rather than just a thump?
Bass pitch perception:  For the complicated bass runs in Song 1, do I hear a pitch with sufficient accuracy to sing or transcribe the part?
Bass finger pluck:  Do I hear the actual impact of fingers on the bass string just before hearing its sound on Song 2?
Shaker variation:  In Song 2, verse 3, do the various shaker shakes sound a bit different from each other, as they should?
"Ripping" of organ / brass:  In Song 3, is there the sensation of hearing each vibration of the French horn and low organ reed tones (sort of the tonal counterpart to hearing a "pitch" from a drumhead in Test 5);
Discern added chord:  About 1:38 into Song 3, after the full orchestra and organ hold a chord at the top of a passage, can I hear a small number of orchestra instruments join in, as sort of an echo, in the second measure of that chord?
 
Headphones were compared in groups of three for each test (even though I am ranking 13 headphones, my small mind could only compare three at a time).  For each test, one of the headphones would perform better than the other two, and I would score it with three points.  The second best headphone received two points, and the worst received 1.  In the event of a tie, I would award two headphones the same score, but would adjust the score so that they still totaled 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 across the three headphones (this sometimes led to scores like 2.5).  The scores of each headphone were added up for the 10 tests to provide a total score, which was highest for the "best" sounding headphone of the three.
 
This test was not without its problems.  By basing the score of each headphone on its rank order position, I tended to overemphasize small differences in performance and deemphasize large differences.  Hence, in comparing the vast soundstage of the Sennheiser HD 598 to the tiny soundstage of an IEM, there could at most be a two point difference, just as if I compared the vast HD 598 soundstage to the big-but-not-vast soundstage of say the Grado PS500.  However, I feel that trying to assign an absolute score to each criterion (great, OK, not good, for example) would be even more fraught with error.
 
The figure below consists of seven tables of 3-way rankings of headphones on each of the 10 tests.  Several headphones occur multiple times, and the color scheme assigns the same color to that headphone each time it appears in one of the seven trios (Sennheiser HD 598 is always green, for example).  These repeated headphones form anchor points to help merge the various lists of three into one long rank order list.
 
The final panel, in blue at the lower right, lists the headphones in descending order of sound quality as indicated by the seven three-way tests.  It is the same as the list that starts this post, but it also includes the nature of the headphone (e.g., open vs. closed, dynamic vs. electrostatic, etc.) and provides a price (usually on amazon.com, but in the case of the Stax, only available used on eBay).
 

Seven three-way comparisons of headphones (four top panels and three left-most
lower panels), with color indicating same headphone, and final overall ranking (blue).
A score of "3" is given to the headphone that is the best of the three on a feature.
 
Summary of Each Headphone:
 
Like children, each of my headphones is dear, treasured, unique, and can be sold on eBay if it misbehaves!  Here is a quick bit on each one:
 
Stax SR-5 / SRD-6: I have been carrying these around since 1978, when I got them for professional use, completed their use, then set them aside.  They predate any audiophile headphone interest I had by decades!  They have far and away the best of the "treble-related" features I listed as my criteria above, and though their bass is weak (drops off by 8 dB sloping from 60 Hz down to 20 Hz), they are so good at preserving harmonics of the bass that you still both sense it and can characterize it.... you just can't feel it.
 
Grado PS500:  Wonderful, treble-accurate headphones with better bass than Stax (but not impactful bass).  They have transparency, drum and other impulse impact accuracy, and are fabulous to listen to.  Unfortunately, their on-ear design limits the time I can wear them (there are "G-cushions" that can be added that change them to over ear, but I find I prefer their sound with the original on-ear cushions).  Thought they do not benefit from a separate amplifier (I tried it!), they are not friendly to portable audio... their UHPLC copper wires and plug converter weigh TWICE as much as my iPod that I plug them into!
 
Sennheiser CX300II:  These IEMs were another rediscovery.  I had bought them for my Kindle, not wanting to have the fuss of a non-working inline remote provided by my Apple IEMs.  I set them aside, only using them on occasion, until I started comparing things for this post.  Then I found that they had both great treble features and great bass impact, both at the same time (very poor sound stage though).  As a result, I use them a LOT now.
 
Sennheiser HD 598:  These were my first venture into top-quality headphones, and they set the direction for my expectations now.  They opened up the idea of crystal clarity in high frequencies and the joys of a vast sound stage.  The purchase of the Grado PS500 was as a result of trying to get even more of the advantage that the HD 598s introduced me to.  They are still my single favorite headphone, if I could have only one. They have great sound, great comfort, great looks, and a great price on Amazon!
 
NAD VISO hp:  These are probably the best combination of great sound, convenience for portability (they DO have in-line remote for iPod and iPhone), and comfort.  They are very highly rated, at the top of their class, yet cost the same as Beats Studio 2013.  However, they are closed, and I find I like the Sennheiser HD 598 open sound better.  In fact, despite their great quality, I hardly ever use these!
 
Beats Pro:  I love these headphones! They have the strong grab-your-throat-and-shake-you bass but still have a reasonable amount of treble clarity. Their construction is wonderfully durable, they are comfortable, and they look great.  They even have a swing-up arm on each ear to move that one side off your ear when needed.  Their plug fits into my iPhone despite the fact that I have the leather iPhone case which requires special attention for the plug to fit into the headphone jack.
 
Beats Studio 2013:  These are redesigned from the original Beats Studio and are better in sound, comfort, quality, and looks.  They have active noise cancellation (two levels, with the strongest in operation when you do not have music playing) and have an in-line Apple remote.  They too have grab-you-by-the-throat bass, but do not have quite the treble clarity of the Beats Pro (perhaps due to the active noise cancellation, which impacts upper frequency response).  They require active noise cancellation (and a charged battery) to operate.  They are made of plastic, but it is a soft plastic that bends rather than breaking, and are quite satisfactory in durability.
 
Beats Studio 2013 Wireless:  As near as I can tell, these are identical in sound quality to the Beats Studio 2013 (wired) listed above.  They can be operated with or without a wire.  The left earpiece of the headphone has a rocker disc that you push to perform the Apple remote functions of volume, pause, song skip/repeat, as well as to reconnect the Bluetooth.  They too are active noise cancellation that is always on.  These are my favorite wireless headphones, and they are light enough to stay on the head even while performing repetitive motions such as vacuuming.
 
Parrot Zik:  These are wonderful, clever headphones with a designer flair (Phillipe Starck, who also designs speakers).  Both wireless and active noise cancelling, they have a touch panel on the side of one earpiece to control song transport and volume.  They automatically sense when taken off and pause your music.  Sound is very good... only when I compared it to the Beats Studio 2013 Wireless did I realize that it could be better.  It includes an iPhone / iPod app that allows you to set equalization (seven presets plus one user-specified contour), reverberation level, and angle subtended by the sound stage.  Neat!  A bit heavy though... mine have fallen off of my head several times during active use.
 
Apple In Ear Headphones:  These are the optional upgrade to the white ear pods sold with Apple products.  They are two-driver dynamic transducers and have good bass and treble sound as a result (but not the bass strength of the Sennheiser CS 300 II mentioned above).  They come in a clever wrap-around triangular case with a variety of ear cushions. 
 
Apple Earpods:  These are the newer earbuds introduced with Apple iPhone 4G a couple of years ago.  They have quite good sound and are very easy to put in (though since they hang in your earway, they feel like they are about to fall out).  Many articles have been written about the sophistication of design that these show.  They sound good!
 
Sennheiser PXC 310 BT: This was my first introduction to the simultaneous world of wireless Bluetooth and active noise cancellation.  These headphones, though at the bottom of my sound quality list, still sound very good.  Better yet, they actually fold up so small as to fit (admittedly tightly) into your shirt pocket, making them a good alternative to earbuds for portability.  They have good sound, but their active noise cancellation, which can be switched off or on, is not as great as the Beats or Parrot.  They are on-ear not over ear, which also admits noise.
 
So this was a rather lengthy treatise on the very short question of "Rank the Headphones That You Own."  I hope it provides some good comparison data on various headphones.
 
P.S.  As  you might suspect, I can turn even the simplest question into the most complicated.  I have to look at a thermometer to answer the simple question "Are you cold?" 
 
And when my wife sends me to the store to get fish, I have to take that problem back to its fundamentals, as shown here...

you prefer the HP100 over the Q701? so you really need to try the DT880...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It's more versatile and detailed than the Q701 imo.  I still prefer the Q701 for jazz due to the soundstage.
 
I might save up and go for the HE-560 which sounds like a more neutral Q701 with better imaging.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

dont really remember how my HP100 sounded, but i had the Q701 and the hp100 in the same time, and i sold the hp100 only because my Q701 was much better in everything (to my opinion)
interesting that you prefer the soundmagic over the q701...
 
you heard the DT880?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have a pair of DT880s which i enjoy listening to. i like the nice mids and highs, the bass tho not too over powering is punchy and fast,  i do get a nice fat bottom end out of them when EQ'ed.. overall its a nice pair.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In comparison to the HP100, The DT880 AND the Q701 both has more life-like tone to them... 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Never heard the dt880. The Q701 is an excellent phone but lacking in sub bass to be a great all rounder. Everything I've listened to on the HP100 sounded great (except rock maybe because mids aren't forward enough). The treble and bass are both outstanding though. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

This feels a bit unfair since I have one pair of headphones that stands head and shoulders above the rest for pretty obvious reasons, but here's my list anyway.
 
Philips Fidelio X1
Onkyo ES-FC300
Sony MDR-X05
Koss KSC75 (modded)
Shure SRH440
Sony MDR-EX37B (so sibilance, much harsh, wow)
 
Keep in mind that I keep Fidelio X1s at home and everything else is a portable of some sort. SRH440s are just not the best portable I've used. Not that they were ever really marketed for that. They sound good out of my PC, though.

A bit of an update after finding out something amazing...
 
1: Sony DR-Z7 (with ELC correction): Let me explain this. The Z7 was released in the late 1970s, when "Loudness" buttons were commonplace on stereo receivers. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find one WITHOUT said button. 
 
Loudness Compensation Explained: (Click to show)
There has always been some confusion among consumers as to what the loudness switch actually does, so I'll explain it breifly, as it's pretty interesting.
 

 
The ELC, or Equal Loudness Curve, is essentially the frequency response of the average human ear. This response changes as the gain/volume of a heard sound increases; basically, as volume increases, the perceived volume of midrange frequencies also increases. The loudness button applies an EQ curve based on the output level of the speakers in order to compensate for this and make it sound more linear.

 
Sony used this to their advantage when tuning the Z7. They heavily overdampened the Z7's bass, which made it shockingly linear and controlled down low at the cost of making it significantly quieter relative to the upper mids. The resulting FR mirrors the ELC almost perfectly. When the Loudness compensation is applied to the headphone, it completely transforms. The once claustrophobic and congested presentation opens up, the sound evens out, and this headphone sounds remarkably transparent and accurate. Bass is insanely deep and powerful. Treble is refined, extended and articulate. Mids are gloriously full-bodied and euphoric. Transients remain amazing, and imaging becomes phenomenal. The best headphone experience I've ever had, bar none.
 
Still extremely ******* uncomfortable though. 
-
-
-
-
-
-
2: Sony DR-Z7 (no compensation): Still good, but with reservations. As aforementioned the presentation is a little claustrophobic and suffocating, and the <huge> upper midrange hump causes them to sound congested and harsh at loud volumes. Sound has direction but no placement; sounds very collapsed and deflated. Still great and easily better than a lot of gear, but after finally hearing these the way they were meant to sound, I'm never going back.
-
3: Sterling TE-400: Very obscure but shockingly good. Probably the very first headphone with titanium-plated transducers. Very accurate FR, phenomenally good transients and imaging, huge soundstage, good impact. Sort of like a baby Z7 in some ways. Unfortunately, its from the 80's, so it's built like a cheap toy. A bit too much bass and can sound a little hot and congested at times; I suspect an open bass port that should be closed. Very comfortable.
-
-
4: Pioneer Monitor 10: Special. Not the most amazing transients or extension, and really uncomfortable, but there's something incredibly special about its presentation and soundstaging. Very euphoric and "fun" while maintaining an overall flat frequency response. Absurd isolation, but not glasses-friendly. Way too heavy for long term use.
-
5: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: I don't know, I suspect these need more power than their specs suggest due to the revolutionary transducer. Extremely fast and HUGE staging, but sounds a bit out of control and congested on dense passages; likely due to its very low impedance and VERY thin driver substrate. Built well, sexiest headphone ever, very comfortable, very sensitive. 
-
-
-
-
-
-
6: Audio-Technica ATH-6D: "Meh" in almost every way. Kind of middy. Cloudy presentation. Imprecise. Sorta fast. Pretty disappointing, but dear god, these are literally the most comfortable headphones I have EVER worn, including the HD800. No clamp, very light, incredibly breathable pads. These disappear entirely and I can wear them for hours. Still get use simply because of this fact; primarily for gaming.
 
Note: The "-"s represent a scale; the M10 and M10-II are very close in performance, for example; it's mostly preference between the two. The 10-II will probably sound a lot better to most people.

Define "good". The Monitor 10 isn't rare at all but they were used in studios a LOT, so 90% of pairs are beat up all to hell. The headphone is remarkably durable and it's hard to find a broken one, but finding a "good" condition pair is tough and can cost a lot. Finding a pair with the box is very uncommon. Who knows what a mint pair would go for. I'd be comfortable at around $100-120 for a "good" pair, but most pairs are <not> in good shape. Mine looked good in the photos on eBay, but guess what I'm now trying to sell so I can get a nicer pair.
 
It's an iconic headphone, and the design is revolutionary for its time. Looking purely at sound... I'd place it above most of what I've heard. It's not a detail microscope by any means but it does seem to have a bit of transparency to it; all parts in the music are audible, separation is far ahead of its time, extension is great. It has a very special soundstage presentation, one of if not my absolute favorite of any headphone. It's holographic and 3-dimensional and sounds remarkably lifelike with the right material. Finally, I don't know what, but something about it makes me tap my feet in pleasure every time I use it, and almost no other headphones do this. I think this is what some people call "musical". 
 
Unfortunately, all things considered, it's not a good headphone for long-term use unless you like pain. It's a little bit heavier than the LCD-2, it clamps like hell, and the headband is completely unpadded. It's also a damn monster-- absolutely massive and goofy looking with lots of huge, gaudy chrome parts. You'll get some looks if you try to use it out on the streets. It's also a beast to drive; don't listen to Pioneer's claimed 100dB/mW, as that's a blatant lie.
 
If you buy one, make sure the pair you buy has the foam inserts in the cups. They're a key part to getting their proper sound, and they don't sound very good without them. The foam doesn't deteriorate like the later Monitor 10-II, so don't worry about that, but people seem to lose these pieces a lot so make sure you check for them.
 
Cheers.

o_O JVC DX1000s topped all that? I must know more.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


He said he ranked them based on how much time he spends with them, so obviously he's a basshead. The DX1000 is supposed to have the most intense bass of any headphone. 
 
Comparatively, the TH600's bass is pretty weak, Grados are bassless, ATs aren't much less so, the Sig DJ is a bass monster... etc.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I was puzzled too, and that's a sensible explanation.
 
(While we're on the subject of bassheads, "treblehead" doesn't really roll off the tongue. May I suggest brighthead?)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I don't know, to me brightness is more than just a description of the frequency response, it also indicates peaks, resonances, distortion, and other treble problems. Like, my DR-Z7 is extremely treble happy but its not harsh or bright sounding in any way, while my SA3000, RP18, TH600, etc were all incredibly harsh, distorted, and bright sounding up top.
 
I've stopped using the term bright because every single headphone I've used that people call "bright" often simply have bad treble instead of actually having high frequency emphasis.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Hahaha, the DX1000 bass is not close to being the most intense of any phone, the JVC SZ2000 would be the one you are thinking of. The DX1000 has well extended bass, but it is not even more in quantity than the TH600, while also having rather emphasized midrange. The treble isn't too rolled either. The signature DJ bass is strong, but not much stronger than a TH600 either. I consider the TH600 bass strong, Sennheisers, Grades etc are not bass less either in my view. I wouldn't define myself as a basshead, I do enjoy less bassy cans like the MS Pro HD800 and T1 and as an overall can if i owned one I'd probably find myself listening to a HD800 almost the most. I put more emphasis on overall sq than anything.
Heres the only dx1000 measurement there seems to be on the web 
The DX1000 is just a very good closed can that I feel suits me the most, especially is euphoric midrange and huge sound staging.
Putting the DX1000 over other high end cans is not unusual, there is a lcd2 vs Dx1000 thread with a poll, the DX1000 out voted them. Of course the DX1000 would be one of the most unknown closed high end cans, kind of like how the FAD PH IV has been flying under the radar. I'm not sure some people who might end up popping up in this thread would know what the DX1000 is without a Google search.Edited by UNIFi - 5/16/14 at 6:26pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I owned the DX1000, wasn't my cup of tea. I liked the Denon AH-D2000 better.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Bass impact is a direct function of driver excursion and bass extension. Amplitude has absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. 
 
Have you even heard the TH600? Its bass is (measurably) very deep and very loud but its an absolute wuss when it comes to slam and power. My Z7 is treble-happy as hell and a lot less emphasized than the TH600 down low but it still manages to provide the most heavy and intense bass impact of all of my headphones and all of the headphones I've ever heard. Here's its (uncompensated) FR:
 

 
Grados and (most) sennheisers are also measurably bassless; what you're hearing are lower mids. And the Pandora Hope IV is going under the radar because Final isn't well known and their previous headphone was a disaster.
Edited by takato14 - 5/16/14 at 10:43pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I own the TH600... not sure I'm the one who should be questioned about not hearing a headphone, it appears you haven't heard the DX1000 and desire to comment like an expert. Something you've done in the past If I recall.
 
 
The impact of the DX1000, TH600 are not huge. The Signature DJ impacts more. The TH600 has more audible bass quantity, but like you say less impact. The TH600 bass is more impactful compared to most of the other ones in my list - again compared to those on my list. The DX1000 is no where near the most intense bass impact nor does it have the most quantity going around.

New comparison of the headphones I have.
My portable DiY ortho (I really need a real name for them as well as make a better less microphonic and more flexible cable) (really comfy with the ESW9 pads as well as a sound that's oh so good for instrumentals and vocals - them magical ortho mids working their hardest for my ears - but the bass quantity really falls behind the D2K)
D2K (so good for all things electronic and bass-happy but the mids seem a bit distant when compared to the PDO and not as magical so to speak and the treble is a bit sharp in non-electronic genres as well)
Q40 (simply outclassed by the D2K comfort-wise, I want to sell these off or swap them for the HD25 ALU my dad's using currently as they're too big for a portable and too uncomfortable for a desktop pair of headphones)
VK-1 (after being spoilt by the PDO and D2K, I find the comfort of these headphones to be just atrocious and once I get Aedle to fix up the pads I'll sell them off to someone else)
TDS-257 (my other DiY ortho) (terrible comfort without the ESW9 pads (and those are taken) and a somewhat weird and extremely coloured sound that's hard to change with damping mods so I want to change the shell the drivers are in to something different)
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


not sure wa5 is a terrible power amp or not...but from what I hear is hd800 is much better on some orchestral music which require large sound stage and power. Also wes driven 009 can not completely over 800. But the SR-009 combo is a great combination for acoustic chamber and jazz vocals. I'd like to say I love my hd800 move at this stage under the unfair comparison.

1. Tony Bennett Awesome Edition Vol. 2 (with M50 pads and desktop amp/dac ONLY)
2. Q701 (stock or modded)
3. HD-650
4. HD-598
 
#1 is there because neither of the rest really do anything better. They do everything WORSE. The ONLY advantage they have is that they're open. HD-650 costs $500 retail and manages to sound more muffled and less clear than my $50 headphone. Luckily bass ported modded Q701 gets close to the TB sound, but still can't compare in low bass extension and sound clarity. But..but..the two open headphones are more airy and have a bigger soundstage! Don't care! Oh, well I guess the Q701 is more analytical. Nice! I found one.
 
Give me a way fuller sounding modded Q701 with better low bass presence and smoother treble and we have the best open headphone of all time. The problem is that it might require being closed? NOTE: K712 is not it. This basically would be my dream headphone.
 
BTW I do love all my headphones but I could easily live without 2-4. I just require an open headphone for comfort and specific music.

I'm a Shure fanboy. Had the SE535 as well a few years back before losing it on a flight. I'm saving up to replace it, or perhaps I might just step up to the SE846.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

At the moment, organized by how much I like the sound because technicalities aren't as important to be as being able to listen to a headphone for hours at a time:
 
ZMF x Vibro (it isn't the most technically proficient, but its sound signature just works for me at the moment)
Hifiman HE500
ZMF V1
Hifiman RE600
Audio Technica AD2000 (I'm having trouble selling this...I'm tempted to keep it but I need the money)
Monster Turbine Pro Copper (Edited from the original version. I really like these and the Golds after digging them out again)
Shure SE530
Monster Turbine Pro Gold
Yamaha HP3
DUNU DN1000
Modded PortaPro
Beats Pro
AKG K271
ACS T15
Realistic Pro 50
Velodyne vTrue
DUNU Tai Chi
AKG K181DJ
 
The rest I haven't used in so long I'm not bothering to list them because I barely remember how they sound.

I've been tempted in the past to buy ZMF modded headphones, but the ZMF x Vibro is soooo expensive. ;~; Considered Mayflower, instead, if I pick a modded T50RP.
 
I looked at the Monster Turbine series quite a few times, but I have my doubts as to whether or not they're worth the money. Not bad performers, but every person I know and talk to who I can consider an "audiophile" thinks Monster makes crap headphones, and their IEMs are no exception.
 
But they still look cool.
 
EDIT: Just noticed modded PortaPros are right above Beats Pro. Vanilla Ice-burn!

I have been considering the ZMF as well. Hopefully someone can chime in, coming from the A900x/K550 and hoping for a worthy upgrade! 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I like the ZMF x Vibro more than the Alpha Dogs, which are "only" $100 less, but that's definitely a preference thing. I do prefer the look of the ZMF's wooden cups though. The regular ZMF is pretty dang good too. I'd totally understand if someone liked them more than their wooden siblings.
 
I just listened to the Monsters again, and honestly, they're pretty close to the SE530... I got them way back in like 2012 
 
My PortaPros are oddly better-sounding than a lot of other pairs I'd heard. I'd actually rank them above the Bowers and Wilkins P7, well above the V-MODA M100 (Honestly I'd put them close to the bottom of the list), Momentum, T50p (but not above the T51p), Bang and Olufsen H6, and lots more portable headphones for personal enjoyment (not necessarily technicalities; no amount of modding can add that). It could be that I've just gotten used to the sound, but I think they're pretty darn good. I found some weird felt that tamed the brightness, yet also tamed the bass. Over the years, dust has started to get through the holes and into the diaphragm and they have some nasty distortion in the low end, but I'm too scared to send them in for repairs for fear I'll get something that sounds worse.

Which one? The V1 might be a bit of a side grade in all honesty. The K550 aren't half bad and to get a complete upgrade, you'll have to spend a lot of money, especially if you want a closed headphone.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'll bite as well, with two questions.
 
Given the quoted 74000JPY price on the Fostex site, do you think that the TH500RP is a better value than the $1100 PM-1, or would you still recommend the PM-1 from a value standpoint?
 
And then, why do you prefer the XC over the X?

What!? Audatron before Sterling? Complete blasphemy
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Uh... yeah? The Audatron is one of the worst headphones I've ever owned. Even after extensive modifications it's still really poor sounding. I have managed to make improvements in all areas: sound, appearance, and comfort, and it's still dead last. It is almost nothing like the Audatron you're thinking of. I currently have the drivers in a fully open implementation, similarly to the K1000, which while a lot better than they were stock isn't nearly as cool as it sounds.
 
But yeah, the Sterlings are really good, if the bass wasn't quite so overcooked/hot they'd be quite a few notches above the Sextetts.

Also of note is the RS1/PS500 can swap places depending on mood and what I'm listening to. Actually the whole top 4 can be interchangeable based on mood.

Currently own only 1 headphone, but here's my list according to many, many demos and previously owned pairs of headphones.
 
Overall ranking:
 
The Number "1" spot, the 3 headphones that sound pretty much perfect to me;
JVC HA-DX2000 (currently own) - Closed can, lush and very rich, lovely timbre.
AKG K812 Pro - Open can, clean and precise, accurate and a massive soundstage.
STAX SR-009 - Does everything great, though lacking in timbre and sounds mechanical at times. Also costs the equivalent of a human sacrifice. 
 
Everything else that's kinda just what I'm not interested in owning in anymore, all either lacking something important or just not to my tastes.
Fostex TH-900 - Peaky treble, and pointlessly expensive. 
Hifiman HE-560 - Very nice overall, but is simply beaten out by the other 3 on top. 
Audeze LCD-X/XC - Soundstage is a little too congested for my tastes, 
ATH-W3000ANV - Missing something in the highs, treble less smooth than I'd like. Bass lacks tightness. 
Fostex TH-600 - Same as it's big brother, albeit more U-shaped and much cheaper. 
 
All else I forget :D

We're beginning to get too far afield if people start ranking what they used to own, or heard at a meet, or borrowed, &c. I'd rather stick to the topic. Thanks.Edited by Claritas - 6/8/14 at 11:13pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Well, of all the headphones I ranked, the only one I borrowed was the MA900. All others I owned for extensive periods and remember them well enough to rank...
 
As I mentioned, I only own three headphones (one closed, one open, and one IEM) so posting only those would have been redundant on my part. I thought what I listed would be helpful, but I'll just unsubscribe since you want to be all critical about it.
 
Geesh, people do ruin the fun of these threads, sometimes. Reminds me why I haven't been as active as I used to...

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I disagree. While I think that things that people heard at some point is a little unfair, I think that borrowing a headphone for an extensive period of time or owning it at one point is fair game. You still got the user experience with them. You might not be able to compare them side-by-side, but you can compare them empirically. I don't see a problem with that.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Except that here is the original post with the original rules for the thread
 

 
If you want to start a new thread listing every headphone you've owned , tried, etc - go ahead.  The idea of this one is to list the ones you own.  It's also good because you can revisit it as you make changes.  Listing every headphone you've ever owned or heard just becomes too much.  I've owned 20-30 headphones.  I've heard many more than that.  But it's far more meaningful if I just list the 4 or 5 that I have.

Yup 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
No - and please tell me where I stated that.  Oh that's right - I didn't  .
 
What I would suggest is sticking to the original rules of this thread.
 
It's your choice whether you participate or not.  And I've seen posters rank just two headphones - so it's up to you whether you participate.
 
If you don't like the rules - then start your own thread.  I'm sure you'll get many participants.

I really feel it's up to the user even though the thread says otherwise.  As long as people mention which they used to own and what they currently own, I don't see a problem with it.  I personally don't list anything I used to own because I don't feel I can compare them fair enough given Amp/DAC upgrades and not remembering the sound signature well enough.  To each his own, of course.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

From experience with DT880, Q701, HD600, and more,
I feel that the ER4S is more accurate. more balanced. more neutral.

Again, I don't see the problem unless "because I said so" is rationale. But whatever, I'm not going to convince you to think otherwise if that's your position.
 
Either way, there are no headphones I "used to have" that I listened to extensively except for those terrible $15 Skullcandy IEMs from years ago.
 
When my CHC Silverado headphones arrive, I'm going to listen to those for a while before I post my rankings.

the ER-4 is incredibly linear and clean, it's one of the best pieces of audio reproduction gear period, by a very wide margin
 
also there's the comfort issue to consider with the LCD-2, assuming he isn't ranking by sound only
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Yep, I prefer the treble and mids on the ER4S to all my other headphones.

That's very interesting that you use/prefer the DT770s over the DT880s and the K701.  I'm by no means questioning it but just thought it was interesting.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Hahah, I know that the K701 and DT880s are more detailed, open-sounding and that stuff, but my main headphone for almost every genre is the Audeze, the electronic, movie and series master is the DT770 (less weight, punchy bass, etc.), the DT880s and K701s are only used for classical and OSTs.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Update to previous post:
 
1) Grado SR-80i - Great balanced and neutral sound. Use for listening to itunes on home PC (use Apple lossless for music ripped from CDs)  
2) Klipsh Image One Bluetooth - Efficient and good bass for listening to music on ipod/ipad when traveling. 
3) Blackbox i10 - Great sound for ear buds, can only use with ipod/ipad (3rd Generation or lower
4) Bose OE2 - Good sound but let my son use them since I got the Grado and Klipsh.
5) Syllable G08 Bluetooth - Heavy bass, fair to mediocre sound, Beats copycat, I gave them to my other son to use since I got 1) and 2) .
 
For a headphone amplifier I use Syba USB 2.0 24bit/96KHz DAC with Stereo Headphone Amplifier Sound Card (Great value I bought from Amazon for $41!).  This allows easy switching between Headphones and computer speakers (which are bose with subwoofer).

Haven't owned my newest headphones for a while but I think I can make a decent list now.
 
Philips Fidelio X1 (my only open headphone, granted)
Onkyo ES-FC300 (<3 this for portable use)
Shure SRH440 (needs a good source to drive properly; not that comfy)
Sony MDR-X05 (still like it for bass, but it's really lacking in treble)
CHC Silverado (I don't hate this headphone; I actually kinda like it, but it's... strange)
 
I would list the Koss KSC75, but I don't want people to get the wrong idea thinking I think it's so much better than my other headphones. I'd probably slot it in between the SRH440 and MDR-X05, but it's modded and is only really good for home use, for me. Very good for when I want to relax, though.
 
Also, my Sony EX37Bs broke. Good riddance; worst sibilance I've heard from a headphone. Planning to replace it with RHA MA750, since I have no IEMs at the moment. Was considering HiFiMAN RE-400 but I want something more bassy even though I like neutral sound signatures.
 
I hope to own Sennheiser HD 600s in the mid-future. Get it, mid? Ha. Ha.

In terms of fun:

3) Denon C300
4)Sony ma900 = Beyer dt880
Note: the dt880's are last because they're the least bass heavy out of all my headphones, but by no means are they 'boring'. They're completely neutral and that's what I like about them. They're the type of can you grab late at night when you just want to relax and listen to your music, the others on the list (except the ma900) are for when you want some heavy pounding bass that will make you jump in your place

by basslight I mean headphones with bass that is extremely controlled and clean to the point where it is entirely devoid of bloom or "felt bass"; most people call this "stat-like bass" because electrostats inherently have this control whereas it is an extremely rare thing in dynamics and even planars
 
the Sony DR-Z7 has this quality, and the Fostex T50v1 and its variants (NAD RP18, Sansui SS-100) have it as well
 
the SA5000, Q701, HD600, HD800, etc are all fart machines to my ears; the F1 is probably no exception, I don't see how else it could even have bass with the driver that far away from the ear

Sennheiser HD700
Sennheiser HD650
Sennheiser Amperior
Sennheiser Momentum Over Ear
Sennheiser Momentum On Ear
Sennheiser PX360
Sennheiser HD449
Sennheiser HD429
Sennheiser HD414
Sennheiser HD410 SL
Beats Solo - Really my neice's Beats, but they were left behind so I claimed them.
 
I rate the HD414 higher than the HD410SL because my Schiit Asgard 2 is able to drive the 414s to a loud level, while the 410SL's basically laugh at my A2. At like for like volumes, the HD410SLs have the better sound, but those volumes are too low for me for me to REALLY get into the music. I get the feeling that if I bought a Valhalla 2 or Lyr 2 then things might change. But or now, this is based on having a Schiit A2 and UberForst.
 
In the end, all my modern headphones sound better than these two little vintage Senns...cept for the beats. Now thats not me being a Beats hater, rather the HD414 and HD410SL are the inverse of the Beats: good highs and mids, nice seperation and detail, but absolutely NO bottom end to speak of...I mean NONE. If I 'make them' closed back by using my hands, the sound improves tremendously.
 
The Beats have bass, but that all it has, however, what truly kills the Beats is that the bass sounds totally artificial: the bass sounds like the bass you get from 'bass boost,' where you get a bump in bass, but its kinda sloppy and it completely muddles up the mids and highs. The Beats have ZERO, NO seperation, clarity or detail, its just bass. Im surprised that the HD429s truly sound much better than the Beats, the only prob with that is that the HD429s and 449s (the only modern cans on the list that have a comparable MSRP to Beats) do require much more juice than the Beats, so I can see how Beats MIGHT be more satisfying to people if they dont have some sort of amp.
 
Price (price of headphone + any additional equipment required to make can sound good) IS a Factor:
Sennheiser Amperior (paid $200 - nothing else required, this is plug and play goodness)
Sennheiser HD650 (paid $365 - just needs raw power to sound good, yes it scales up wonderfully, but you truly dont need more the a Fiio E9 to justify the price.)
Sennheiser HD700 (paid $650 - needs power, but refined power, and also requires the right DAC. I mainly use it with my Asgard 2/UberForst but it works just fine on a FiiO X3+Modi combo, so I guess a Modi+Magni would be good too, which is about $200)
Sennheiser PX360 (paid $125 - just needs a lil more power than most portable devices can deliver, a Fiio E7 would do)
Sennheiser Momentum Over Ear (paid $350 - nothing else required, this is plug and play goodness)
Sennheiser Momentum On Ear (paid $200 - nothing else required, this is plug and play goodness)
Sennheiser HD429 (paid $40 - just needs a lil more power than most portable devices can deliver, a Fiio E7 would do)
Sennheiser HD449 (paid $89 - just needs a lil more power than most portable devices can deliver, a Fiio E7 would do)
Sennheiser HD414 (paid $25+$10 for new pads - A2 drives it well enough, prob would do well with a Valhalla 2...a bit of warmth from tubes would do it right)
Sennheiser HD410SL (paid $38+$10 for new pads - Laughs at my A2, no less than a Valhalla 2 would do, interested in seeing what it can do with a Lyr 2...a bit of warmth from tubes would do it right) 
Beats Solo (paid nothing, but MSRP is $150 nothing else required, cuz it aint gonna make a difference)
 
When you factor in the price of the headphone AND the price of the equipment needed to make it sound good, things change. I can honestly say that if all I had was an onboard sounds on my desktop and lap top, if all I had was my phone as my DAP, and I only had $350 to spend, I would gladly pay $350 (original MSRP) for the Amperiors: they are AWESOME on ANY setup. It's not unheard of getting the HD650 from sub $400 dollars, so spending another $80 or so on an E9/E9K would make for some good listening, and truly put you into a different level of quality. Yes, the HD650s do scale up nicely, and the will get better with better equipment, but If all I had was about $450 to spend on gear, id buy the HD650 and an E9, in fact I used my HD650s like this for over 2 years, and it was always great. 
 
The HD700s are truly the best sounding headphones I use, but they are damn picky with equipment. They dont require the same amount of power as the HD650s do (they can be driven very very easily by a Fiio X3 on its own), but if that power isn't refined, if your DAC isn't compatible with  the HD700 sound signature, then the cans sound dull, lifeless, maybe even painful and downright disappointing. With the proper equipment though (they sound good with an X3 and Modi, and I have read that people really like the Modi+Magni combo for these cans, they are SUBLIME with the A2+Uberfrost), they truly just blow everything else that I have out of the water, they are awesome. However $650+$250 (A2)+$450 (Uberfrost) = $1350, which is not a light investment, even $650+$200 (Modi+Magni)= $850 is quite a lot to invest in on a whim. When you can get great sound for about $450 from an HD650 and E9, I dont think the HD700 with MM or A2-UF is 2 or 3 times as good; it is BETTER, but not 2x-3x better. I think thats the point where the diminishing returns on investment start to show: if you go for an HD700, then you are trying to get a better product, even if the price isn't scaling linearly anymore. I am still happy with the HD700, I am very happy I bought these headphones and the required components, but I'd be lying if I said it was 2x as good as the HD650
 
The PX360s I think were $199 MSRP, but I got them for $125 when they came out; now that they are discontinued, you could get them for well below $100 (I think ive seen them for $60). At those prices, plus the cost of an E7 or E7K, these are just an awesome bargain. They don't have the bass impact of the Momentums, and dont have the detail of the Amperiors, plus the DO require some amping, but again, with a small investment, the sound quality is near the level (say a tier below) of the Momentums Over Ear and Amperiors, and probably right on par with the Momentum On-Ears. These are like the Amperior Lights, or Diet Amperiors in terms of sound signature and quality. If you can find these for less than $100, and you need 'cheaper' headphones, I truly dont see why youd consider anything else. These are just good ass headphones.
 
From here on, things get a bit pedestrian. The HD429 are damn fine sounding headphones for the 'cheapy' tier, and the HD449 are good, but not great at their price level. THey are both basically 'serviceable' and make fine headphones for situations where messing up a pair of cans isn't unheard of (think working out, fishing, working outside, etc). The only drawback is that I do feel they could use some amping if you are using them with your phones, or most DAPs.
 
I didn't want to be so harsh on the Beats. I remember when I first head them I didnt think the were so bad: i liked their bass, and just figured they were OK cans for people who didnt know better and prop listened strictly to hip hop, and nothing but. I listen to ALOT of hip hop, and I have listened to it on all my headphones, and now, I truly dont think these cans are good for that genre. Good hip hop has a lot of layers, it has a lot textures and a lot of layered sounds, its not just about hitting the bass hard, hip hop with great MCs require that the MCs voice comes through clear, we want to hear the voice of the rapper, all of that is lost with the Beats, and all we get is 'bass boost' sounding bass, everything else is lost!
 
True enough, the HD429/449 may not be the funnest cans to listen to hip hop in terms of bass, but in terms of appreciating a well crafted hip hop song (think A Tribe Called Quest, or The Chronic/2000, or Doggystyle), they do the job better than Beats. Both cans can be had with an E7 for about the same price or less than Beats.
 
As far as the Vintage cans go, I will save any commentary on them. I am really curious to see what these cans can do on an LP or reel to reel or cassette, with a tube amp. They not only need warmth, but need power. I dont think I could listen to these for too long on modern digital recordings, especially hi-rez stuff, I think these cans would actually sound BETTER on sources and amps that are not as 'clean', but warmer, with a little bit of hiss and background noise. I think they would do well to replicate a true vintage, nostalgic sound.

From lowest to highest rating in traditional count down form.
Ratting different kinds of headphones that are intended for different uses in different applications is difficult as it's comparing apples and oranges in some cases. Buuut here we go anyway...
12.Bludio r+ bluetooth headphones.
Look like beats....multiple divers...bass bass bass Nothin else. Good for crapy movies without wires.
11.Sennheiser HD430
10. Sennheiser HD450
Both very similar but the 450 has slightly more bass especially with akg171 pads. And the 450 have a slightly higher output.
9.Sennheiser HD480
These need a warm source or they are a pit sterile, I have a 70s nikko reciver that I drive these from that's a nice match.
8.AKG 271
7.AKG 141
As much as I like the closed back 271 I feel the mids are a little recessed and the highs are a little more brittle than the open back 141.
6.Pioneer SE-L201 with akg171 drivers.
These frankinstien sound better and look better than the 141.
5.AKG K99
These also benefit from a warm source but as for clarity, in the mids and highs are some of the best bang for your buck headphones you can get. Lacking in bass response but great for acoustic stuff and jazz...classical ect.
4.Beyerdynamic dt770
Capable closed back that's quite balanced with good isolation.
3.Sennheiser HD25
Best compromise for isolation and audio quality. Great for on the go. Compact too.
2.Sennheiser HD250 linear II
Best closed back headphone I've heard. So accurate and balanced and surprisingly open. I have dt770 pads that help tame the bass and give it an incredibly even frequency response. These are probably my most used headphones even if they don't take out top ranking.
1.Hifi man HE 400
Open open open back orthodynamic headphone. Easy to drive. Separation and articulation is divine so is the bass reproduction...much like open baffle dipole loud speakers. Definite favorite but limited in application due to isolation.Edited by robthebiggerman - 6/16/14 at 8:47pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yes, really. The Z7 gives me all of the bass and none of the B/S, and I can't say that about any of those headphones I mentioned.
 
The HD600 was loose, diffuse, and bloomy, the HD800 was much of the same (to a slightly lesser degree), the SA5000 was just a mess, and the Q701 was about the same as the HD800 but slightly less diffused
 
And they were all extremely well amped so don't try to play that card

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Haven't had a chance to hear them yet, but measurements suggest they are (though to a much lesser degree than the dynamics I listed)
 
Exceptions are the LCD-3, HE-6, and Abyss, all of which exhibit absurdly good control on the 30Hz wave
 
keep in mind we are only talking about bass here -- the Z7 has numerous weaknesses too
 
also woo 2200'th post
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Alright I were just curious. I don't agree on the fart machine stuff, but some of them have bass that doesn't sound completly natural tho imo (the ones you listed in the first post I responded too).
And congrats ;-) 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


None of the headphones he listed are 'fart machines' by any stretch of the imagination (mind you HD600 is a bit loose but euphonic as hell)
Planars have the best bass presentation I've heard by far, just feeling the impact brings my music enjoyment up to the next level (needs to be tight bass though)

all of the headphones I mentioned have measurably poor bass performance, you've simply never heard anything better
 
try an electrostat and you'll understand what I'm talking about, some people like it and some people don't, but objectively it's more accurate
 
before I start a fight let me stress something: this hobby is highly subjective and it doesn't really matter what's right from an objective standpoint, what matters is what you like most, and in my case I want as little noise/bloom/"felt" bass as physically possible

I love my HD650's and D7000 but hardly ever get to listen to them b/c of noisy environments. Nothing beats the portability and isolation of the HP50's combined with the extremely balanced sound. The Sennheiser is slightly too dark and the Denon is a little bit too v-shaped. The HP50, although lacking in detail and soundstage, seems to strike the perfect balance.

I've heard electrostats, meh... I like more tactility to my music
Most of the time analytical 'phones are just boring as... I'd rather have a more musical presentation, don't care about having a perfectly flat response (yawn)
If it's a subjective hobby, you really should stop stating your opinions as fact too, nearly all your previous posts are condemning well-regarded headphones in a very objective manner (some of the headphones you haven't even heard, yet you are bashing on them)
Meh, I'm in heaven with my so-called bass bloated headphones, it's just all opinion after all I guess
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The thing about the Staxen I've used (a few Lambda models and the Omega2) I've used is that while they measure well and do sound good, their bass just doesn't do it for me. The only way I really can describe it is weird, almost diffused. I'm not necessarily looking for a thump, but their presentation just never sounded like any concert hall I've been to. I still yearn for an SR007, but if I do end up with one, it certainly wouldn't be because I liked their bass.

Really depends on the music I'm listening to and my mood. Sometimes I want the warm and bassy X1 or the hard hitting and more V shaped D2000. Through my main listening setup the HD700 makes me the happiest. Looking hard at a set of HE500s for a bit of orthostatic goodness.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I never state my opinion as fact, I state facts as facts, maybe you should learn to differentiate between what is objective and what is subjective on your own instead of expecting people to append everything they say with "imo"
 
If I see a large undershoot and subsequent ringing on a 30Hz square wave, I would say "this headphone has poor bass control". The driver is taking too long to return to a smooth line so objectively it's not as good as a headphone that returns to a smooth line faster.  This is a purely objective statement, there is no opinion in it, I am describing what I see in the measurements and nothing more.
 

I never said anything about bass bloat, but yes the only thing that matters in the end is whether you like what you hear or not, not if everything your headphones are outputting is perfect

Not a fan of the bright & treble heavy sound of the DT880, especially in the lower treble region (5~8khz). DT1350 on the other hand is more balanced, where treble sounds more natural and sibilance-free - hence the higher ranking.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Same Impression here. I don't know why Beyer isn't revising the dt880. It's such a great headphone but the Beyerpeak is really annoying. Beyer, if you're reading this, please consider making an anniversary edition with no 8kHz spike. It would be a bargain. Even if it would cost 100 bucks more.

Personally I'd prefer they work on their Quality Control, I had 3 DT1350s and all of them sounded wildly different, one was acceptable but the other two were damn terrible.
 
In a best case scenario, the peak on the DT880 should be able to be eliminated with a simple enclosure/dampening mod, as 10kHz resonances are usually enclosure-borne, not driver-borne. I'll probably experiment with the headphones if I ever buy a pair.

bizarre, I'd think tubes would pair horribly with the K340 since it's already got warmth/bass problems
 
is it a stock K340?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Just because it's tubes doesn't mean the tubes are warm sounding.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Yes, the stock version of the bass light or neutral one. It needs tubes to add body to the electret treble; also takes the edge off.

These are warm tubes in a lush amp. But the military grade RCA adds real power and drive: it makes Arthur Rubinstein sound like Vladimir Horowitz. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Ah I see. I have heard there are two versions of the K340, I haven't heard either though. I am curious about them though.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



There are at least two. No one really knows how many, but conservatively there's bass heavy and bass light. I'm supposing Tak was talking about the bass heavy, which supposedly is bloated in stock form. (There's even a conjecture that there's really only one K340 but they all sound different because of the aging electrets, but there's nothing to back that up so I don't believe it.)
If you're interested in how it sounds, it reminds me most of RS1.Edited by Claritas - 7/3/14 at 8:06pm

Well considering different productions runs, I wouldn't be surprised they changed the sound at some point at least once. It's been done with the HD 600/650, K701/2, K240, K1000, R10, etc.

Instead of relying on professional reviews on these cans, can I ask you to enlighten me with your perspective on the hd580 & hd650? I have own the 580 for more than 10yrs and have been wondering about the 650's lately. What are the main differences? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



The 650 was my upgrade from the excellent 580s, and to my ears the difference was mainly improved midrange clarity and high end extension, plus they image very well.  The 580's remain one of my favorites for all-around good sound and even though the Alpha Dogs are my new #1, I still find myself reaching for the 580's for quick plug in and listen when I don't want to fire up the amp.  The 650's take it up a notch from overall good sound into the realm of critical listening... and the Alpha Dogs, to my mind, top them with overall better balance.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) T1
2) ATH-W5000
3) ATH-W1000X
4) HD650
 
Ranked in terms of both my preference and head time. I like the T1 and W5000 almost equally, and the the W1000X and HD650 almost equally. So perhaps the two pairs are more like 1 and 2. They present the music in contrasting signatures.
 
I mostly use the HD650 when I'm lying down, mainly because the narrowish shape of the cups allows you to lay your head down without the headphone being moved.

I'd suggest skipping it in favor of the HE-400i, HE-500, or HE-560, as the DT990 definitely outclasses the HE-400.

I agree MacedonianHero that the SR-009 is the best headphone I've ever owned or even heard, but what about the HE90? Have you heard it? It seems to me that most people who've owned both seem to think that the Orpheus (HE90) is (at least) slightly better.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Most of the reliable impressions of the orpheus say it's a really poorly designed stat, it's designed to sound euphoric and inviting instead of perfect
 
it'd probably complement the 009 but it's definitely not better than it
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I haven't heard the HE90s. Sorry, but I was only ranking headphones that I own. Some love the HE90s and some...not so much (like Birgir). I'd love to hear a pair mind you!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Thanks takato14 for input. It's just hard for me to understand how an electrostatic headphone designed and built over 20 years ago could still eclipse STAX's best offering as of 2014 (to so many people). I know it's a matter of taste sometimes. 
 
 

 
Yeah, I hope Sennheiser releases another electrostatic headphone sometime in the future. They were too good at it to not produce another one again, no matter what the cost is.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Thanks Takato. You've saved me some time and money. I never would've thought the DT990 was better than HE-400, I just knew they were similar. I guess the extra cash for HE-500 would be worth it. I've got a FiiO E07K right now, if I pair it up with an E09K that should drive some HE-500s right? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


What did you think about the differences between the DT880-600 and DT880-32? Did you own them both at the same time?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'd go with something more current oriented than the E09K, though low budget current amps are relatively scarce. The E09k would probably sound alright with the HE-500, but I'm not positive. Perhaps a Magni instead (though you'd need to use a different DAC).
 
A Lehmann BCL or one of it's many clones might be suitable, as that's what I'll be getting for my setup once I can afford it. I've got a few current monsters myself and I could let you know how it performs.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
It's not. While the HE400 was my least favorite Hifiman headphone (which isn't exactly an insult), it's definitely not worse-sounding than the DT990. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Wait, ****.
 
I thought he meant the DT990 Premium, not the Pro. Yeah, the HE-400 is probably at about the same level as the Pro, whereas the Premium is more refined.
 
Still, making the extra stride for the HE-500 wouldn't be a bad decision. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



same time for about 10-15 days, just the time to test and sell the 32Ohm. The 600's are smoother and more refined in the top. Capable of playing at louder volumes without being harsh or sibilant and with more controlled bass.
That is only if powered with an amp that can drive 600 Ohm well. I had an OTL similar to the BH Crack, a Burson 160D and an A1 clone Gold at that time. Paired with the Burson the 32Ohm were more lively and sounded better than the 600, with the OTL there was no contest. I've tried the 250 Ohm ED as well and it was more opened and overall better than 32 Ohm.
My advice is to go for the 32 Ohm only with portables.

6. Denon D600 - great sound and bass
7. HE-400 - probably in the top 5 depending on my mood - I love this sound and bass
8. M-Audio Q40 - now with the thicker HM-5 pads - a great sounding headphone with sweet bass
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Have prices really moved that low now? The reason I ignored it during my last purchasing phase was because I thought it was going for a couple hundred bucks more than $500.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Hold on, you do realize its the same headphone with the same drivers, except that the Pro's clamp a little harder..? So how is the Premium more refined?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I've been following the 7100 for a couple of months and saw the pricing hitting mid $500's, then a couple I found right around $500.  And the one I got still had the shrink film on the cups.............just a few hours usage.  I do think at $700+ it's high. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


for 500-ish I would agree they're worth it just not for $700 IMO.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Would you describe these headphones as sibilant? I'm interested in them, but I don't buy overly-sibilant headphones. That just ruins the music.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Mind you, I'm not prone to hearing "screechiness".  People said the Pro900 was like nails on a chalkboard but not to me.  That said, the HE-400 has very nice treble presentation - very nice and I like how it's rendered.  No sibilance to me at all.  Female voices are awesome (like Sade). 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Implementation is everything, and the enclosure on the Pro is a lot different than the one on the Premium. Something can use the same driver as something else, yet sound wildly different.
 
Note the stock Fostex T50RP compared to (insert XYZ T50RP mod here).

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


No offense, but have you even heard both the DT990 Pro and Premiums? I own the DT880 Pro's, and have also tried the Premium. To me the sound was identical (both were 250 ohms) the Pro's clamped a bit harder which made subbass stand out ever so slightly more, but was the sound more refined? Absolutely not. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I have to agree. Anyways the internal dampening and drivers on both the DT 990 Pro 250 and the Premium 250 is exactly the same, they just have aesthetic, cable, and clamp differences. The sound is the same, especially if you bend the Pros headband to be around the Premiums clamp.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Umm...you can't really compare the different DT990s with different T50RP mods. Different mods have different damping, unlike the two DT990s (unless I was misled by the Beyer parts seller when I emailed them). It's been a while since I've used either, and it wasn't a side by side comparison, but the difference was mostly similar to the Pro/Premium DT880. I actually liked the DT990 Pro more because it was less strident. Sure, the cups are different, but I felt that the extra clamp/less distance between ear and driver created more of a difference than the different housings.

1: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Immensely articulate and refined. Transparent and clear. Has the same "pioneer smoothness" present in almost all of their old gear. Flawless treble.  A little bit of weirdness in the bass that I simply cannot explain. Poor build quality and a very resonant enclosure. Reliant on a perfect seal; not glasses-friendly. Supremely comfortable; almost enjoyable to wear. Astonishingly good for their time period; probably the best headphone in the world at one point.
 
1.5: Sony DR-Z7: A perfect complement to the 10-II. Thick, intimate, bassy. Basically flat with slightly elevated bass and roll off at the very extremes of the treble. Absurd bass impact and slam, with zero bloom or noise. "Fun". Incredibly good build quality and isolation. Gorgeous. Essentially no soundstage; can sound very confused at times. Extremely poor comfort, hence the slightly lower ranking. Again, astonishingly good for their time period. Definitely the best headphone in the world at the time, and still amazingly competent today.

Let’s see. 
 
1. Grado PS1000. I’ve owned this one before, then sold it as I had different front end gear that accentuated the bad points of this one (treble harshness). Now got it again and it’s fantastic on my MAD Ear+ amp. It hits the right balance of technicalities (clarity, details), soundstage and fun.
 
2. Grado RS1i. Using them with flat pads. Intimate, warm, but energetic sound that I haven’t found executed better on any other headphone. Main issue is lack of bass extension. 
 
3. KEF M200 IEM. Comfort with the stock tips caused me to use these less and less but some comply T500 Isolation tips make everything all better. I find these remarkable for providing deep, clean bass and a wonderfully forward and rich midrange. Excellent soundstage, too. I’ve toyed around with some $1K+ IEMs but sold them. For my occasional use every couple days, this one gets close enough in SQ and I’m not paranoid about their cost and dropping them.
 
4. Apple Dual Driver IEMS. Very underrated dual driver BA IEM. Super clean and clear sound. very comfortable. And a good deal under $100. sound is slightly thin as bass just has no oomph.
 
5. Hifiman RE-400. I’m placing them below the Apple IEMs. They have a wider soundstage and slightly better bass than the Apple IEMs but the mids sound slightly recessed and hollow. not a lot, but enough to drop slightly below the cleaner Apple midrange and well below the robust M200s.

LCD 2 - nothing else is really close at this point except...
Senn 600 via the Bottlehead crack - just a really lovely pairing. Hard to best for orchestral/opera
Grado 225 - still fun for punk and rock (and sometimes jazz)
Denon 2000 - great all-around. Good sound, comfortable, well built (sellers remorse, I'll probably get another set in the next 12 months)
Better DT 1350 - solid all around (my #1 travel/commute can)
Akg sextett - great mids, perfect for vocals
Beyer Dt880 600s - good but a bit abraisive to my ears. Hard to beat the resolution, but not what I'm looking for these days. Going up for sale soon.
Fostex t50 - pretty good all-around
Akg 240 monitor 600s - good but not as good as the sextetts. Still handy to have around

God... I really don't want to accept it, but...
 
1: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Holy crap, Pioneer. Released in 1985, and yet I haven't heard a monitoring headphone as good as this one. All frequencies, from sub bass to high treble, are present and absolutely flawless. Clarity is through the roof; these are one of if not the most resolving headphones I've ever used. Superlow distortion, smooth as butter. Has this sense of finesse and effortlessness to the sound that is simply breathtaking. Very comfy, too. Caveats are a restricted soundstage size when compared to the original Monitor 10 (which is super deep and seperated) and a very poorly designed enclosure that's simply too breakable and too resonant. Some mass loading to the baffle helps this a little, but that can only do so much.
 
2: Sony DR-Z7: I don't know, somehow it's just as fast if not faster than the 10-II, and all of the details are still there, but... something about it is definitely off. It sounds like it's trying too hard, if that makes sense. It sounds strained and almost distorted at times, especially in the upper midrange, though not in an aggressive way. It's either high even-order distortion or the fact that this is a far-field speaker cone being smashed up against your ear... probably a little of both, actually. Still enjoyable, but it has been bested, especially in comfort. Seriously, ow Sony.
 
Nothing else is worth ranking. These two are all I need, and the Z7 is seeing less and less use every day...

Very happy with current headphones although owned a set of  Grado SR60's for the last twenty years which always sounded superb - couldn't sell them so gave them away to a friend also into high Rez music and he has raved on about the sound ever since.
 
Now have Sony's audiophile-grade XBA-4 in-ear headphones which deliver highly refined sound, with potent bass, airy treble, and excellent noise-isolating performance. They incorporate four balanced armature drivers in each earpiece for ambient noise isolation. This headpone setup is great on the move with my Fiio X5 running High Rez recordings.
 
And!
 
Latest buy is the Audeze LCD-2 (up dated model) planar magnetic headphones. Fast and dynamic with terrific bass, beautifil midrange. They appear to be heavy when sitting in the case but found I can wear them for hours without fatigue.
 
The Audeze LCD-2's are the obvious best pick of the two.

I haven't heard the DT 250, so I can't say if they are similar or not, it's definitely not like other Beyers I've heard though. One thing is for sure the DT 150 doesn't sound like a closed headphone in terms of clarity, soundstage, and spaciousness yet it somehow manages to produce a big powerful bass that dynamic open-backs generally aren't capable of when it's called for while still retaining clarity and coherency. It's a rather lush sounding headphone with a good amount of body to it's sound and doesn't seem lacking in the bass, mids, or highs although it is on the dark and warm side in terms of tonality. It sort of reminds me of the HD 650(going by memory) with somewhat more prominent highs(seems to have a slight Beyer-peak) and more powerful bass while still having mids on the intimate side with a bit of the Beyer flavor to its sound. It's a rather unique sounding headphone in my opinion. The pads need to break-in more so the seal will be better and they need a bit more use.

I find that very interesting. Why did you put the LCD2 so low?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Probably the recessed treble and intimacy
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I put it low because I haven't used it much to be honest. I didn't have a decent amp to drive it with. I do now...so the rank of the LCD2.2 will be rising! Bamboo and Velour baby!!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yeah lcd 2 are magic...differently dont lack intimacy I feel like im on a hammock on a tropical island drinking a pina colada.....I think all the dynamic phones r getting left behind by all the new planar cans.... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I thought the LCD-2 was something special when I heard it. I haven't heard the fazored though. I would agree that dynamics are getting a bit left behind by planars, there are some exceptions but planars seem to be taking over, I'll probably go the planar route for my end-game headphone, most likely an Audeze phone, unless Sony manages to release a proper R10 successor with their upcoming flagship. I think the problem is that only a few dynamics out there are truly well-implemented.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yeah I think sennheiser reached the top of the snowy dynamic mt top with the hd800...but planars are climbing a bigger mountain .. cant wait to see whats comingEdited by jimi30 - 8/8/14 at 11:53pm .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Actually I personally don't think the HD 800 has quite reached the top, it's not as good as the R10 imho. The only planar that is quite in the same league as the top electrostatics and the R10 is the Abyss in my opinion. Will planars improve much beyond the Abyss or will it relatively stagnate around the Abyss is the real question. I used to think the one technology was better than the other but then I heard some of the top phones old and new, I'm not so sure anymore. Planars are definitely maturing though.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yeah I guess we will see ..but if I was in the headphone business id be making planar cans...I have a feeling they'll reach far better in the coming years ....but there comes a peak and then its all taste and colour preferences 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I would too as it's the big thing and still maturing. I personally think the Abyss may of hit the plateau of orthos personally, where only small incremental improvements come later on, we shall see. It all really comes down to taste and preference in the end though. Well anyways, I think we strayed off topic a bit too long.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I agree totally! ! I love my grados and most of the time they sound terrible!. But!! Sometimes its bliss ..lol the topic needed some life  lastly... only small increments separate abyss and staxEdited by jimi30 - 8/9/14 at 12:55am

Yeah no the HD800 definitely isn't the pinnacle, the Sony DR-Z7 is considerably faster and has tighter bass, and I assume the same is true of the R10. The HD800 sounds very diffused and loose down low whereas the Z7 is razor flat and incredibly tight.
 
It's a bit emphasized in the lower treble though; no dynamic I've used so far seems to do everything just right. And yes, before anyone asks: I have heard both of them, driven quite well.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I only like using it on special enjoyment occasions. Stax have a wow factor if you intersperse them with dynamic usage; I don't want to get used to the electrostatic sound.


Too bad most R10s are rotting from the inside-out by now. I'm not convinced even a perfect R10 is really better than the HD 800 in non-subjective respects. I think the R10 played second-fiddle to the HE90 and Omega back in the day, but of course I'm biased. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



That is true, most are not aging well. Which is why despite the bass-heavy R10 being my favorite headphone I've ever heard, I will likely never get a pair, that and the fact they have risen so much in price. I haven't seen the full measurements of either R10 before, all I've seen is some FR responses and what I saw was good, so who knows and aspects of sound is likely not even measured properly or can even be measured right. The HD 800 never sounded right to me personally. I'm just going by a purely listening aspect on multiple different systems though. I thought the R10 sounded slightly better than the Orpheus although I seem to be somewhat in the minority in that. I'm biased myself.

This isn't fair either. If companies would get their **** together they'd know that closed can match and sometimes even surpass open when done right.
But I digress, closed headphones are significantly harder to engineer, and there is a considerable gap between most open headphones and most closed headphones. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Agreed but they seem to only be done right (as of the last 10 years) when they're no longer closed and are technically semi-open (fostex, denon DX000 line).

The JVC DX1000, Final Audio Design Pandora Hope VI, Audeze LCDXC are not semi open. The modded cans like ZMF x Vibro and the lot are not semi open either.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I don't consider the LCD-XC to be a "done right" headphone, IMO, the treble was too recessed for me and it's so uncomfortable.  Same with the JVC, I've seen multiple posts about the headband being uncomfortable but I have no heard this headphone myself, so take that with a grain of salt.  I haven't heard the Pandora either so that might work prove me wrong.  I don't think including modded cans (such as the ZMF) is fair given the company who made the headphone originally, couldn't get it "done right" themselves.  If you consider comfort, as I personally do, then the LCDs are out, most likely so are the JVCs (from what I've read), and so are the Focals and then my point still stands.  Again this is my opinion.

Many good headphone models have been made indeed... but amongst all that there are so many under-engineered cans out there at a high price. Its the fun trend to charge thousands for your brand spanking new toy these days, helped along by oft rampant consumerism and acceptance of such a poor value proposition. Though I'm not saying that all highly priced cans are poor quality mind you, don't take this the wrong way. Go vintage, and you will find that there are cans out there that are just as good as the top of the heap in today headphone market, at a far lower cost. Vintage Stax electrostats still sound just as good as many higher priced cans now. When you see some of the measurements, and then hear some of the crazy bad issues some headphones today have, even when they cost $1000 then you really have to scratch your head.

A lot of the fun in this hobby is about the journey so price doens't really matter.  he probably acquired these over many many years..  He might rotate some of them in any & out or maybe he's just a collector.  I know myself, I used to own at least 7 $300+ cans at one point.  I finally sold some of them (and gave some others away) recently because I wasn't ever using them again hah.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah no. I doubt you've even heard any of the pre-2000s era flagships. The 1980s - 1990s were some of the best years in headphone audio. 
 
I prefer my Sony DR-Z7 (1978) and Pioneer Monitor 10-II (1985) to the HD800 by a significant margin. The Z7 is faster and tighter while the 10-II is much cleaner, well extended, and more neutral. I have done direct A/B comparisons between these three headphones; a close friend of mine recently bought an HD800 and lent it to me for a couple weeks. It was very well driven and I gave it a fair shake. It wasn't outright worse than the 10-II or Z7, but they still have traits that they surpass the HD800 in, particularly low end clarity, control, and extension. And hey, guess what? Both the Z7 and 10-II are closed.
 
And of course there's also the Sony MDR-R10 (1990), which most people consider to be the best headphone on the planet. It is also closed, though not sealed like the Z7 and 10-II, and had more engineering put into it than any headphone/earphone to date.

Those cans of massive sound are amazing. They need some amplifying , but they quite fits in better sound card with good pre-amp.Volume is linear, you may be surprised with their purity and cristal clear   with very wide sound stage. Never heard this headphones before like this!!! maybe AKG sound similiar, but not that quality like   6 ohms giants. They are totally analitic and good in any music production  .Not for portable use. With no problem i can compare these headphones with any over 600 euros.The lower the resistance of  drivers ,headphones sounds better. i sign that.

I don't quite agree with your comment regarding modded Cans, ZMF and my favorite, the Alpha Dog, take decent mass produced HP's and recreate them to deliver a significantly better SQ. The Alpha Dogs are neutral, true to the music, and provided an excellent alternative for private listening, IMO. Cheers 🍺

In Serbia there is one man who holds the patent OF coil drivers for speakers, headphones and microphones .
Its his job for 30 years. He patented the winding spune which is unique in the world.
tHE BEST QUALITY  for his patented sound is  that you have any quality second hand or new phones with minimum 50 mm driver.. and for small amount of money you will get one of the best sounding cans that you ever heard. I SIGN THAT. It has equipment for test the quality. I have his  hand refolded  two pairs of JVC headphones . His recommendation is that the headphones are working at minimum 6 ohms, while speakers can go up to a whopping 0.25 ohms. Headphone amplifiers are needed that can give its full capacity. it would be best to stick with germanium transistors, then reach their best expression. the sound quality is amazing. even in the most ordinary sound cards such headphones sounding superior. There is no lying, no cheating
This is the technical specifications of his work >

I agree that the old ones are sometimes best and that there's an obsession with the new. However its not necessary to search for old vintage headphones with difficult to source parts when you can buy a vintage headphone brand new in the beautiful shape of the Beyerdynamic DT150. Wonderful headphones with a vast 'analogue' sound. Great bass and clear but none fatiguing highs. Not typical Beyer in that the mids are not recessed, like everything else they're perfect to my ears.  The fact that they're closed is immaterial they are just  a great example on how to make a closed phone to compete with the best open phones. Other 'vintage' headphones still available new include HD25s, PortaPro and B&O Form 2 all of which i own and love.

Don't forget about the legendary PRO line from Koss, either. Every iteration of the design is still in production, and you can buy a brand-new can that works wonders on a vintage receiver,

How about listing them in order of amount of actual use instead? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Except KOSS's new versions of their headphones have completely redesigned drivers that don't sound anything like their vintage counterparts.
 
Not to mention that even Koss's TOTL vintage model (PRO/4AAA) isn't anywhere near the Z7 or 10-II (or the HD800 for that matter lol). I would however say that a properly rewired and redampened series 2 4AAA is easily better than the HD600 and HD650 though. Very wide and deep staging with good detail and a pleasant, warm signature. 
 
They also had two statement models, the Auditor Dynamic/10 and ESP/10. I really wanna get my hands on those.

I don't know about 1977 but in 1975 Koss's flagship phone(in the UK)  was the ESP9 costing £79 (plus VAT), It was actually the most expensive headphone listed in the UK. Their most expensive dynamic was the K2+2 quadraphonic cosing £49.
 
For comparison the Stax SR-3 and SRD-6 adaptor cost £56, Beyer DT100 £17.11, Sennheiser HD414 £13.50, Sony DR4C £10.45
 
My dad bought Koss HV/LC 'high velocity' headphones £29, which were in use for some 25 years and were the first headphones I listened to (Dark side of the Moon, Tubular Bells, THE test LPs of the time) aged nine.

Back on track and based purely on usage at the moment  as most are equally good in their own way. The DT150s are overall favorites at the moment and probably for the rest of my life, they should last forever along with the HD25s

At the moment, with the plethora of things I'm in the process of shipping out (or have recently shipped out if that's not considered cheating)
 
1. Audio Technica W5000 (I didn't like them until I bent the headband to fit my head; I don't understand why AT just outright refuses to fix this design. Now, they have actually taken my breath away multiple times, and I just got them today)
2. Oppo PM2 (With some melamine in front of the driver to take some of the treble peak)
3. ZMF x Vibro (Newest tuning, a really capable headphone. I wouldn't be surprised if people like it more than the Alpha Dog, which I wasn't the biggest fan of)
4. Hifiman HE500 (I liked it a lot more the first time I had it. It just sounded meh the second time around)
5. Audio Technica W10VTG (It's a really euphoric-sounding headphone, but after comparing it to the W5000, it just sounds really congested)
6. [Grado RS1e] (I don't own this but have it on loan right now so I'll put it here as a frame of reference I guess. It's a Grado, and I happen to kind of like Grados, but there's something about this one that doesn't sit too well with me for anything other than ska and some other music)
7. Audio Technica AD2000 (It's just weird sounding in a great way, but it's the kind of headphone your ears have to adjust to. Shipping this out tomorrow sadly)
8. Master and Dynamic MH40 (Very consumerish sound, haven't gotten to use them much actually)
 
I have more, but I really haven't used anything else for months.

What makes you like the T1 more than the AD?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


http://headfonics.com/2014/08/12-flagship-headphones-compared-the-totl-guide/7/
 
Here's an article that is contrary to his preference. I think some people like a sound signature that is more treble tilted or detail oriented. That is something the T1 is amazing at. The author of this article even goes on to say that he thinks the Alpha Dogs soundstage is deeper.  so really it is a matter of opinion. I honestly need another flagship showdown at the next Head-fi meet I go to in San Diego this fall
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Their sound signatures are very difference but I almost prefer all aspects of the T1 over the AD, except noise isolation. The AD is the best close-back headphones I've ever heard though.

AD1000PRM have most head time though, being the most comfortable out of all of them. A2000X is easily my current second favourite headphone after SR-009.
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I read it a few days ago.  I appreciate the time and effort it took to compile the review.  Unfortunately I found it to be contradictory and sometimes incomprehensible.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Yeah, it's pretty convoluted but I still found the conclusion interesting: "if I were forced to offer an overall winner to you, there is no question that the Alpha Dog absolutely, brutally emaciated the 11 other models in this report. Disregarding price completely, it compares and even bests some of the $1000+ models out there, yet the drivers original manufacturing price was probably less than $10. No other headphone offers as much as the Alpha and it costs hundreds less than it should. Originally, I had written this report with total disregard to pricing and reviewed each model as if they were all the same price. All mentions of pricing on each headphone section were edited in during the final draft copy, I’d originally tried not to let pricing affect my judgment. Even then, the Alpha Dog still bested most of the other headphones in many ways…the fact that it costs $599 is just a massive bonus. This fact should embarrass the hell out of every other company out there."

1: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Maybe a little slow, but otherwise glorious. Razor flat, huge staging, excellent extension in both directions, very good detail and separation, and extremely comfortable. Best monitor I've ever used and probably the best monitor period.
 
2: Pioneer SE-500: I FINALLY realized why I like these so much. They aren't quite as clean as the 10-II and they lack a bit of bass extension but their distortion is still extremely low and they have a very deep soundstage with relatively flat treble and good transients. 
 
3: Sony DR-Z7: Honestly it's only ranking this low right now because the god forsaken cable shorted out and I can't afford to replace it yet. Gotta love 36 year old copper.

Damn, this is challenging. Obviously I would use different headphones for different purposes, some only at home, some mostly on-the-go.

A vertical list like this is misleading in a way, because these headphones are
generally very very close in SQ..  But there are some "jumps" or wider gaps
called for in the list.  Also, I wonder if ranking closed along with open is
fair or justified. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I'm curious, what made you like the Mad Dogs over the NAD HP50?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
 
I got it in a trade, and I've been very happy with it! it is my headphone of choice for movies. It is easily the most comfortable headphone I have, and the sound is better than I expected it to be. It can't compete with the first two on my list in terms of details etc, but it fairs better than I expected it to. But the comfort is just superb.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
It's that planar sound! I find the Mad Dogs to be much clearer and more detailed than the NAD. The NAD has a very nice sound and I do love the "room feel", but I think it's not implemented as good as my old PSB M4U2. It's hard for me to directly compare because my PSB stopped working about 6 months ago, but I'm pretty sure they had better bass, and the on-board amp would improve the dynamics significantly.
I currently alternate between the NAD and the Mad Dogs as my portable headphones, the NAD's advantage is that they can be driven directly by my DX90 but the Mad Dogs require at least an E12 in the middle. So yes, the NAD certainly has its advantages, but when it comes to sound, properly driven, the Mad Dogs are easily clearer & more detailed.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



It's not like you can go much further from there. Choosing an Orpheus, Abyss, R10, or K1000 over an SR009 just comes down to personal preference.

I don't like harshness or sibilance (HD800)
I don't like a massive soundstage for music (HD800, Q701)

Edited by kman1211 - 8/28/14 at 7:07pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The only point without a real argument against it was Takato's observation that many R10s are now rotting away and might not be the best choice right now. However, everyone has his or her own tastes in audio and the K1000, Abyss, etc. all have their fans. They're all considered top-tier headphones in the community as a whole. There's no reason to simply reject a certain headphone from the TOTL category because it doesn't fit your sonic preferences.

What's your reason for putting the LCD-3 lower than the LCD-2? I have yet to hear a pair of LCD-3s, so I don't know my own opinion of them at this point.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


LCD-3 is "technically" a better headphone. More transparency, more resolving, best mids heard on a planar (although HD800 beats it for me with ease). The sub bass on the LCD-3 is actually deeper with more body like Denon's. Imaging is better on LCD-3, although the 2's are more than enough. I lived with both for many months.
 
The problem is that I found the LCD-3 to kind of lag with fast paced music. I think the LCD-3 is more suited for slower and medium paced genres. The LCD-3 does vocals well. Although for anything fast paced like electronic over 100 BPM and it doesn't have that slam. The LCD-3 tends to bloom rather than punch. I found LCD-2 to sound just perfect with every genre, with no fatigue and better PRaT. LCD-2 if you listen to everything with all paced music. LCD-3 for that slower/medium paced music.
 
I missed the LCD-2's when I sold them for the LCD-3 as I kept feeling something was not right, despite still sounding audibly better in some regards (FR coherency, black space, treble extension) and more technically equipped. Also, LCD-2 pairs much better with all kinds of rigs at all prices. The LCD-3 on the other hand, I absolutely couldn't get it to sound the best without spending at least $4500 on a Luxman speaker amp. Not even a BHA-1 or Conductor did the trick with the LCD-3 for me. The LCD-2 had less hassles in amp pairings. Of course, price doesn't relate to performance, but with LCD-3s I sincerely couldn't find anything below $3k that sounded right with them.
 
Of course, both were Classic models and not the new Fazor models.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


That lag you speak of is vastly improved with better amping in my experience. They (LCD-3s) are very quick (and quicker than the LCD-2s) when you have an amp with 2 W minimum into 50 ohms. The advantage of the LCD-2s is that they still sound great with lesser upfront gear.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I practically lived on speaker amps with power ranging anywhere from 40 to 60 Watts @ 8 ohms. Emotiva, Marantz, NAD, Luxman and occasionally McIntosh. I had fun with Luxman speaker amps but the price and form factor of a speaker amp was ridiculous.
 .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
While speaker amps work great with the HE-6s, I found that they weren't very good with Audeze headphones. I've tried Krell, McIntosh, Pioneer and NAD with both and the HE-6s sounded best, while the LCDs lagged behind the dedicated headphone amps I owned/tried (LF/GS-X Mk2/B22).
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah I'll agree with you on Hifiman's responding better to speaker amplification. Although the LCD-2's were much less pickier than LCD-3's. The LCD-2's did quite well with speaker amplification. The LCD-3's on the other hand I just didn't have the luck or patience to get it right after a few months of experimenting.

That's the definite advantage of the LCD-2s...easy to get right. I actually admire them for that feature. The LCD-3s are the toughest and the LCD-X's are somewhere in the middle in that regard.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah I had similar results. HE-500 being the easiest, followed by HE-6 provided you have power, next LCD-2 and then LCD-3. All classic models. No experience with LCD-X. I would try it out but the heavy weight and the fact that the HD800 work so wonderfully keep pushing back any aspirations to experiment with the current Audeze lineup.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

That's an interesting discussion, thanks for the comments re-LCD 2 vs 3. I have yet to listen to any Audeze but am very interested in them. I have been planning to pick up an LCD-3 at some point.
 
That's an interesting comment about the amps. I would be using a Corda Classic, which should give about 3W into that load.

Thanks for all the LCD-2 vs. LCD-3 discussion; that was quite enlightening. I need to make sure that when I hear an LCD-3 I hear a pair properly amped to see if I agree with MacedonianHero when it comes to their scalability. I've only really heard the LCD-2 on a Rega EAR (which I was auditioning at the time as a potential purchase for my HD650) and a Schiit Lyr, but I think they both did a fairly good job driving them.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: Audio-Technica ATH-M40fs.  I've had these for years and done a couple of mods, and they're still my all-around favorite for sound.  Very balanced sound.  Closed, decent isolation, excellent comfort.  Good for every genre of music.  Not the strongest sound stage, but an overall miracle for the price ($50 from Amazon).  The construction of these is unbelievable and they're a modder's dream.  Easy to take apart, every part made for field service, terminal blocks instead of soldering.  I still can't believe that someone decided to mass produce something like this, but they're my favorite to experiment with as it's easy to undo changes. 
 
2: Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250.  Outstanding comfort, wide sound stage, crisp highs.  A good bit more expensive than the stuff that I usually pick up out of curiosity, and certainly very nice.  Very light, requires a bit of power to drive properly, but lovely when done right.  Like #1, I love these for all types of music.  Leaks a lot of sound in and out, so a quiet room is required.  The coolness and comfort of these much more strongly lends itself to long listening sessions.  Sound and comfort would probably put it #1, but the isolation and versatility of the AT keep it ahead for the time being.  If this is what ~$150 buys, I'd love to experience $1,000 cans.
 
3: Koss Pro4AA (1973).  My preferred can for listening to rap.  Very powerful bass that reaches just as low as #1&2, less treble and mids.  Isolates like no other, and doesn't leak sound, either.  When fed lots of power, can play almost impossibly loud without distortion.  Hot and uncomfortable, but just really sounds incredible when I'm listening to rap.  Great for classic rock as well.
 
4: Superlux HD681.  The only one out of this group that can be driven to really satisfying volume by my iPhone 4s.  They're less comfortable than #1&2, but more than 3.  Open enough to feel safe to use outside without missing something dangerous.  Superb for the price, but I think that I find their response peculiarities less offensive than some people.  Tyll's review of these was much more critical than I would be.  These were the gateway drug that led to the DT990 purchase, and do have a similar sound with less comfort.  In spite of the weaknesses, I'd consider them probably the best you can get for $35.
 
It might be a sacrilege around here, but I've modified all 4 to accept cables with 3.5mm ends so that they can be used as headsets on the phone.  While not perfect for critical listening, I have to realistically accept that it's convenient to listen that way and so I adapted the headphones to that.  I can still use a heavier cable at home when it's possible with stronger sources.
 
List of what's next on my list to try (and I'm open to suggestions, especially under the $100 mark):
AKG Q/K701

6.Realistic PRO2 with an upgraded cable
*I would sell both in favor of a PS500
In the streets
1. Audio Techinica ATH-PRO500MK2.Best on-ear I have had so far. Clamping force and shallow pads took some time getting used to but the very good isolation is a major plus. Durability,detachable cable and folding capabilities make it hard to beat in my opinion. Has all the bass I need.
2. Yamaha EPH-100.Best iem I have had so far but that could change when the TTPOD T1E arrives.
3. Beyerdynamic T50p. I do like their look and sound but poor isolation and a flimsy cable made me leave them home.Edited by dwayniac - 9/3/14 at 12:08pm

Just some of my experiences...with the Lyr, the LCD-2s were fantastic, but the LCD-3s still didn't fully hit their stride with that amp. That said, I'm not sure how the Lyr 2 would pair with them. It certainly has plenty of power for them.

That or tube roll to tubes that pair well with the AKGs. My Lyr 2 was disappointing on the K712 with the stock tubes, tube rolling and socket savers made a world of difference for the K712, especially in terms of soundstage, depth, cleanness, smoothness, imaging, bass tightness, bass precision, and bass imaging.

I agree with MacedonianHero.  
 
Both the LCD2 and LCD3 are not difficult to drive--they have purely resistive impedance, if memory serves--but they do require some power to really get going.  But when properly amped, the LCD3 clearly outperforms the LCD2.  Perhaps as Zoom25 stated, the LCD3 did not sound its best with the BHA-1 or Soloist, but I found that I was able to drive both the LCD2 and the LCD3 quite well with two affordable amps, the Vioelectric V200 and the Schiit Mjolnir (for more sparkle). Even with these relatively modest amps, the LCD3 clearly outperforms the LCD2.
 
I also found that I do not necessarily need speaker amps to drive the LCD3:  both the Bakoon HPA-21 and the HeadAmp GS-X Mk2, at just below $3,000, can easily display the LCD3 superlative sound and its superiority to the LCD2. Compared to the HD800 or the TH-900, however, both LCDs still sound a little slow, like two elephants unhurriedly heading toward a water hole. But I must admit there is a certain majesty to this ponderous sound that I quite like.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

There is no argument about the LCD-3 outperforming LCD-2 in every audible way, almost on all setups. On the same side of the coin, the LCD-2 outslammed the LCD-3 on almost all setups.

3. T5p (modded)

3. HiFiMan HE6 with Zeus 22 hard wired cable
4. LA7000 (Lawton modded with Jena Labs cable)
5. AKG K340 modded by Headphile
To my ears, the SR009 is my favorite. The SR009 driven by my A10 with NOS Raytheon tubes sounds superb and it's the combination that I listen to most of the time. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Given that the SR009 is your favorite, I find it interesting that you ranked the LCD-X above the HE-6. What makes the X stand out more to your ears? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hi guys, newbie here :D
 
1. LCD-X w/ black dragon cable
2. HD800 w/ black dragon cable
3. HE-560
4. AKG 550
5. Sennheiser Momentum
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I think the LCD X complements my SR009 better than the HE6. I use the SR009 most of the time and when I want something different I reach for the LCD X, perhaps because it's just a bit more forgiving than the HE6 on lesser recordings. Between the X and the 6, I wouldn't say either is better. Both are very good but different.

1. Hifiman HE-500. Soundwise the most pleasing headphones i've tried. Admittedly im still too scared for my wallet to try most 1000€+ phones. Go-to pair when listening to music. Driven by Schiit magni/modi stack.
2. Sennheiser Amperior. THE portable headphones for me. Tried a plethora of on-ears and IEM's and amperior delivers the full package. Neat looks, suberb sound (for on-ear cans), good comfort and great isolation.
3. Sennheiser HD598. Using these for gaming and movies and when he-500 grow too uncomfortable (after couple of hours usually). HE-500 made me realize these cans are actually not that good, most likely upgrading these into sennheiser HD600/650 next. Driven by fiio e10k.
4. Koss porta pro. The whatever-choice for rainy days and all kinds of rougher outside activities. Good for their price and incredibly durable, thats about it.
5. Sennheiser HD-215. My first "real" headphones from 10+(?) years ago. All-around relatively awful cans. Impossible to sell and i feel inclined to hold on to them for some reason.Edited by dahrk - 9/15/14 at 6:35am

The HE-500 are one of the absolute best at it's price and under $1k. You can still squeeze so much out of it by upgrading your amp and dac. No need to rush to summit-fi phones, you've got something wonderful there.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) AKG Q701(tie): Hauntingly beautiful sounding and highly addictive on my system. Some reason I like this headphones sound better than the K712 despite it being brighter. Smooth, grain-free, dynamic, great imaging, great depth, deep powerful yet very tight bass, beautiful mids and vocals, and a massive 3D soundstage. Can cause shivers down the spine and goosebumps. Sounds good on all genres when amped properly. It's very system picky though and a tad hard sounding at times.
 
1.) Sennheiser HD 600(tie): Another hauntingly beautiful and addicting sounding headphone on my system. A bit darker and more laid-back with softer dynamics, but also spine-shivering and goosebump inducing. It's not quite as fast and detailed as the Q701 and isn't as good in terms of imaging and soundstage. It does have the upper hand in terms of neutrality, naturality, and timbre though. I consider this headphone every bit the Q701's equal. This is another genre master.
 
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 150: This is the best closed-back I have owned. Has a good soundstage, big powerful bass, laid-back sound, good imaging, is very transparent, clean, detailed, etc. and I consider it in the same league as the two above. The reason this is third is because it lacks the texture of the Q701 and HD 600. It also doesn't portray musicality and euphony of a system or recording the same way as the Q701 and the HD 600 do. Sounds good on all genres and is the most forgiving and easiest to drive full-size headphone I have.
 
4.) AKG K612 Pro: This is basically a less refined, less warm, and more spacious sounding AKG version of the HD 600. It's a great headphone but doesn't quite have the resolution and refinement as the three headphones above. This headphone also sounds good on all genres if amped right
 
5.) Fostex T50RP: Has very little grain but has horrible resonance and is a pain to find right system for it. Needs modding to sound it's best.

Completely newb to high end audio but here's mine:

3) Sony XBA-1 - home / office IEM
 
4) Panasonic RPHJE120 - travel use

Listing to the SR-009's right now, I still sense a few flaws in them, which I hope STAX addresses in their next pair of flagship headphones. 
 
I'm thinking about getting some noise canceling headphones, like something from Bose from their QuietComfort line, to make air traveling more comfortable.

There aren't a lot of big fans of the GS1000 around these parts. Have you ever owned or auditioned a PS1000? How would you compare the two? I had a PS1000 for a very long time, but I've never heard a GS1000.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I got to hear the PS1000 this weekend. It is definitely more picky when it comes to sources, as well as more forward in the upper treble – to the point of being peaky on select songs. To me it's got the separation and bass of the GS yet retains the mids and treble forwardness of the RS1

What, the slightly sloppy decay? Slight treble recession?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



How does the IE800 measure up to a good pair of over-ears?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Having owned the HD800's for a long time, I definitely feel that the soundstage and imaging of the SR-009's could be better. It seems that the bass and treble are both slightly receded at the extreme ends as well. The decay is quite excellent, but could be improved (as could every other metric I suppose, and that goes for any headphone). These are all minor complaints. Overall, it's easily the best headphone I've ever heard. The transparency is simply unreal. It's hard to describe; it's something that needs to be heard in person to be appreciated IMO. I'm still waiting on a Blue Hawaii Special Edition amp, which is supposed to be one of the best, if not the best, electrostatic amps for STAX headphones (especially the 009's), so maybe (and hopefully) some of those flaws will diminish or disappear.  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I have only had the IE800s for a few days so I can't say too much about them. They are very detailed and have very good bass and an amazing soundstage and separation for IEMs. However, as soon as I put on either of the other full size headphones the sound just opens up so much more and everything feels more real and natural. I'm probably not explaining it well, but quality over ear headphones have a bigger, more spacious sound even that quality IEMs. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

For sheer musicality and enjoyment I now have:
1) Senn HE60
2) Stax SR009
3) HD800 (now that I've found their ideal amping needs)
4) Stax SR007
5) HE6
6) AD2000/LCD 3
7) Various Custom In Ears - not especially competitive with any of my desktop setups 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Why is the HE60 above the SR009 for you? Warmer and more involving? What are you driving them with?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The HE60 has what is likely the most liquid, euphonic and palpable sound I've heard in a headphone. From a technicalities viewpoint it probably couldn't carry the SR009's jockstrap, but it sure is a fun listen. Using a KGSS to drive it.

3. Audio Technica ATH PRO700MK2 w/ Street by 50 pads and dampening mods. BASS,durability and isolation
4. Audio Technica ATH PRO500MK2. Much less clarity than the T50p but wins for durability,portability,bass and isolation.
4. Beyerdynamic T50p. I like them but whenever I use them,I feel like the cable is too flimsy for portable use.
5. Yamaha EPH-100. Backup IEM.
6. AKG Q701. I like the sound but the fit is wrong for my long head,making them uncomfortable.
7. Modified (cable) Radioshack Realistic PROIIA. Their ugly brown color and weight are their only downfalls.

Both of these headphones rank first in my ears and hearts. They are both special to me. They are Grado SR60 and Sennheiser HD600. I can live with either of them. Why this Grado SR60 so fun? Why this Sennheiser HD600 so emotional?

I've used several phones over the years, but, aside from junk that came with equipment, I only have 2 serious ones now.
 
1. Sennheiser HD540 Reference
2. Stax SR Gamma/SRD7 adapter
 
The adapter hasn't worked for some time, so I'm using just the HD540, but it is a favorite. One of these days I'll get the Stax unit fixed, because those are also a very light, comfortable set, with a lovely sound.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Thanks, happy to be here.
 
Dac/amps i use is wa7d/tp, burson conductor, and chord hugo. Source is ak240 or osx. 
:( sad to say choices of dac/amps/audio gear here in the philippines is very very limited. 
 
I primarily use my Wa7d/tp for the HE-560
my favourite for long listening sessions.
 
I hope someday i could go to one of head-fi's meet ups :(

HD-800 - Standard of excellence. ( Ok, maybe just my opinion. )
 
OPPO PM-2 - All-round contender.
 
DT-880 - Great bang for the buck.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Here is my list based on combined factors of price/performance/head-time/"enjoyment" , basically my subjective overall "rating". The higher on the list, the more I would recommend those :)
 
- Home use higher-end
 
1. Audeze LCD2.2 (Microsuede Pads, Rosewood, Non-Fazor) - These headphones fricking rock !!! It just does everything right, bass is extraordinary, mids are crispy clear and mainly treble is just right where I wanted it to be + everything has so much energy to it. Even for crazy retail 1145$ these are serious high-end headphones I would recommend to try out. Oh and I forgot to mention they actually look and feel like high-end as for build quiality. Keepers without second guess !
ps: It just blew my mind when I found out I can actually hear "tongue movement... for lack of better description" of female singer when she takes a breath to sing. (Parov Stelar - With You)
.
.
basically huge hole here ....
.
.
.
.
2. Sennheiser HD650 - Just legendary headphones, superb for the price if someone prefers dark cans
3. Sennheiser HD700 - Fast paced cans with quite a lot of treble, I did enjoy them for long time, but there are serious issues with some bright recordings
4. Beyerdynamic T1 - Had quite mixed emotions about T1's, expected much more for the price. My main issue was treble with these.
 
- Home use rest
 
1. Grado SR225i - Got these for 120$ or so, would recommend to anyone looking for "cheap & fun" set of cans, overall great with awesome punch on bass.
2. Shure SRH940 - Also another "cheap" at least here in CZ set of great closed cans, would definitely recommend to someone who can't use open cans.
3. HiFiMAN HE-400 - I couldn't handle the treble spike on these, but have exceptional bass for the price.
4. AKG K701 - Even with good amping, K701's just sound lifeless to me.
 
- Portables
 
1. AKG K314P - Have been using them for about 2 years, superb for 10$ :D
2. Creative Aurana Live! - Some ppl enjoy these but, they sound really, really dark to me. Bass-head cans.
3. KOSS Porta Pro 25th Annies - Well known cans, wasn't much of a fan myself, sound overly dark and boomy to me even tho they are semi-open.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Sounds like you prefer dark sounding headphones. You like iems? I wonder what you prefer in the IEM world. I can see you liking ie80, 846, roxanne especially. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Don't have any experience with "IEM", aside from iPhone in-ears and K314P, but ordered the Ostry KC06a since K314P are sort of finished.
 
By roxanne you mean http://www.jhaudio.com/content/sirens-roxanne ?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yes. Only because you love your lcd 2.2 and 650. Which I own. If you ever crave what you have in a headphone in in-ears, the roxanne would suit you nicely. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Wow, thanks for tip. I'am just not sure when will I get extra 1650$ for in ears, that's pretty big price tag. Are they really that good ?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



They are great. I was talking about the universal version though. YMMV on customs vs universals. Universal cost about 300-400 less than the custom. Both are great. It's getting great reviews overall, minus the drama from last year's black friday fiasco.

Damn it's been a while since I've posted in this place
Onto my rankings:
Over/On ears:
1. Senn HD800: beautiful piece of machinery this is, I save it for the most special of occasion and only has bout 2 or 3 hours of use on em, but I loved every second
2. Shure Srh440 (Temporarily Retired): broke the poor ole cable when my portable rig fell (lost my Dragonfly and this ;-; ) People weren't lying when they've said this thing is extremely detailed, it just barely is under the 800 in term of detail and has a pretty nice tonality for everything. this is(was) my primary gaming phones due to the detailing
3. Beyer DT250 (tied): best 27 dollars I've ever spent!, is very durable and sounds mighty fine when in my proper rig, doesn't do too much in the details department (a little above average) but, it's tonality and directional capabities are excellent, with it fitting more to hiphop and electronic and being pretty decent at gaming. Helps that they are reeeaally comfy.
3.K240 Sextetts(tied): my only vintage and probably my favorite, it has absolutely phenomenal stereo feel and beats my grados in that respect. The tonality is great for rock and live-performance tracks, which I have plenty of thankfully. I'm expecting these to rise once I do my restoration mod (probably 2 or tied for one).
4. Akg K545 (tied): Was an awesome gift from a relative. Probably has the most comfort out of all of these (tied with the hd800 in short term) and has a nice silky warm sound to them, feels mighty fine whenever I wanna just have a mellow night or just in the mood for a bassy funfest (has some really nice bass).
4. Ath-WS99 (tied): have had these for a while and love the bassy-ness, but the comfort and the below average detailing really breaks it for me. The sound though, whenever Im in a really portable mood, is perfect, although my x10's are a better overall IEM vs this.
5.Denon Hp-700: Has one of my favorite tonalities and the detailing is top notch, but, the lack of comfort (even after several mods and pad rolls) and the fact it doesn't play nice with tube-like amps really has made these fall down on my list.
5.Grado Sr-60i: My Grados, despite their low ranking, are one of more common daily drivers, mostly because of ease of use (doesn't require a schiit ton of power like the sextetts and the beyers) and the amount of ease it takes to get into the flow of the tonality.
6.Senn HD439(retired): Ah, my old workhorse, I used to put this through everything and completely ruined them towards the end of things, was really quite sad of what happened, but alas, now I have much better sets to tweak with.
Incoming:
1. ZMF Master models: I've been saving up for these for about a year and I finally get it! I'm super excited and am expecting it to be at the tip top
IEM's:
1.Klipsch x10: One of my first IEMs and certainly one of my favorites. It has some of the richest bass, with impact that's phenomenal and detailing that is almost on the level of the hd800's (only in the bass though), the rest of the tonality is very neutral, with little bits of sparkle up top to liven things
2 Teac ZE-1000: I used to love the comfort on these bad boys, but over time the pancake tips have become quite scratchy with my ears and make it a pain to enjoy music, otherwise these are clear, neutral and have a very detailed and delicious sound.
3. Decibullz: was a kickstarter project that I was looking forward too, mostly for the molds. They sound alright, v-sound signature, which is unsurprising. Average detailing and overall really average. The comfort is great though and I love that about them

Hmm...
1: DT880 Pro. Current A cans, love them to death. A bit soft compared to my AKG's, but then they open up, and the highs start sparkling, and they just *sing*...
2: AKG K272HD. Bright and fast, and got a great deal used. My only portable closed-back mid-fi can so far, but a bit thin-sounding for home use.
3: ATH-A700. First mid-fi cans, got them for cheap off of ebay with a broken wing, then put a few dozen hours of sound through them in the glee of the first 'real' pair of headphones!
4: SE215. Don't like IEM's much, but these fit the bill for listening on the go. Right side crackles...going to lay them to rest soon.
5: K240DF. Used a few times for A/V gigs, but never for music. Sits in my gig bag, lonely and sad.
6: Bose Triport. 1st set ever, now used the least...
And then there's the pile of broken and useless headphones in the closet...but we don't speak of those!

1. Denon AH-D5000  The last time I posted in this thread the A900Xs took the lead, momentarily the D5000s are my favorites again, instrument timbre is spot on.
2. Audio Technica ATH-A900X I find them musically more balanced and cohesive than ATH W1000X, which I found to be easily provoked into aggressiveness in the high mids and low treble.
3. Roland RH-300 If these had a bigger soundstage and more top end they could beat both D5000s and A900Xs. Their tonality is really natural, 'analogue' and grainless.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I do not consider myself to be an audiophile in any way, but oh my.  They are simply the greatest set of headphones I have ever owned/tried.  My only gripe is that they need two AAA's to work...

For me with HTPC (i7 CPU, Win 8.1 JRiver ver. 20 USB3.0) to iDSD Micro DAC to Schiit Audio ASGARD 2 AMP:
 
1. Sennheiser HD-650
2. Sennheiser RS-180s (No amp with these as they are amped by the wireless base unit.)
3. Koss Porta Pros ("Modded" with better ear-pads)
4. Super.Fi3  (Tie between 4 & 5 depending on song/genre)
5. VMODA Bass-Freqs  (Tie between 4 & 5 depending on song/genre)
6. Photive PH-BTX6 (Bluetooth headphones in wired-mode)
7. Photive PH-BTX6 (Bluetooth headphones in bluetooth-mode)
8. Apple Earpods
9. Apple Earbuds
10.  Grado SR-225e  (If you take "comfort" out of the equation, then they place 4th easily, but they were REALLY uncomfortable!) 
 
Disclaimer:  The GRADOs were EXCELLENT if you want detail and clarity. A bit too bright for our tastes, but most of the headphones we have are bass-heavy, so that is what we are used to, and now sounds "natural" to us I guess.  While the Sennheisers were both preferred clearly over the Grados, the Koss Porta Pros were neck and neck in terms of sound quality, soundstage, and detail.  (Once the Porta Pros were modded with these: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NTVFNYU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 pads.)  Noticeable difference from the stock "foam covers" that they ship with.

1: Sennheiser HD250 Linear II: Perfect (sometimes too much so, these rip things apart), very comfy, huge stage, unmatched bass and treble extension, ridiculous clarity and detail
-
2: AKG Q701: Close to the 250 but middy and less refined by comparison; possibly more "natural" and easier to listen to 
-
3: Sony DR-Z7: Close to the Qs but slightly less refined overall, more bass, less treble, smaller soundstage
-
4: Pioneer Monitor 10: Slightly less refined than any of the above but very very nice sounding in tonality and timbre; these are special
-
-
5: Yamaha YHD-1: Amazing little things with a great soundstage and clarity; a bit too dark
-
6: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Ok these things have some REALLY weird frame resonances going on that makes them sound very uneven and wrong, but are MUCH more natural and detailed sounding in their timbre and presentation than the HD250; these need some mods to shine 
-
-
-
7: Sony MDR-605: Incredibly competent for their price; huge soundstage with excellent placement, not very grainy, a bit of upper midrange nasties and warmth but very listenable
-
-
8: Pioneer Monitor 8: Good but not great; ATH-M50 with a huge soundstage, less upper midrange B/S, and better detail, but a bit artificial sounding; ugly as sin
9: Sterling TE-400: Good beaters, warm and sparkly with good soundstaging, detailed but somewhat grainy, really cheaply made

10: Pioneer SE-500 (modded): Still keeping these; they don't have a lot of bass but they sound a lot like the M10 up top with speedier transients and can sound marvelous with the right material

Time for an update methinks.
 
1 - Hifiman HE-500 (open vent mod) + Emotiva mini-X a100 Gen2 - breathtaking every time.
   - The next bunch are all VERY close
2 - Fostex T20RP MKII (Nick's Make-up pad mod etc + Shure pads + DIY comfort headband) - it's coloured but does SO much right.
3 - Beyerdynamic DT990 (vintage 600 ohm + Philips SHP 2500 ear pads) - this headphone is nearly perfect.
4 - Sennheiser Momentum 
5 - AKG K340 (bass heavy?) - would be #2 if it only had sub bass and a more bass detail/texture.
 
6 - Fostex T10 + XB500 ear pads - nothing extra special, but I really dig the FR for super relaxing with juicy bass EDM - sort of boomy/textured bass at the same time if you can believe that.
 
7 - everything else that doesn't get much use

My top four headphones are very close in ranking and will change in ranking depending on my mood, though I am going by overall preference over time with these headphones. These four are all headphones I can happily live with. 
 
1.) AKG K712 Pro: These headphones are the most versatile headphones I have, they don't do any genre bad, are great for movies and games as well. Very well balanced and revealing, problems with a recording or a system are shown with ease, these are the headphones I build my system around. Plenty detailed, wonderful soundstage, deep bass, sparkly and airy treble, musical, pleasent mids, and non-fatiguing when amped right. 
 
2.) Beyerdynamic DT 150: This headphone gets a good amount of use as they are my only closed-backs. They are the best sounding closed-backs I have owned and are on the same level as the K712 and HD 600 in terms of refinement. They have beautiful mids. They have a medium sized but very 3D soundstage, they unusually spacious and open-sounding for a closed-back(more open-sounding than the HD 600 on my system). The treble is nice and the bass is nice though a bit heavy on some songs. 
 
3.) Sennheiser HD 600 Avantgarde: This is a musical, warm, and slightly dark sounding headphone. Overall refinement is a bit higher than the HD 545, but it's tuning is quite different. The treble has a bit a bluntness to it and the bass has a bit of a bloom. But it's also more enjoyable to listen to long term than the HD 545 and is a bit more musical.
 
4.) Sennheiser HD 545 Reference: These headphones are extremely neutral and linear, probably the closest I've heard to neutral of the headphones I have owned. It's also very musical and addicting. They don't emphasis sibilance at all and are non-fatiguing. It basically sounds like an HD 600 with linear bass and a proper amount of air and treble sparkle with a larger soundstage. 
 
............
 
5.) AKG K612 Pro: Incredibly linear and balanced with deep extending bass, as balanced and linear as the HD 545, but this headphone is marred by some grain in the upper regions and an odd shimmer effect in the treble and upper mids that make it seem brighter than it should be, it becomes especially noticeable after extended listening. 
 
6.) Fostex T50RP: I can say right now these just sound weird to my ears and I don't like them. Resonance galore and an odd distance to the sound. Overly flat and 2D soundstage.

My story with headphones has been long, went through many mistresses, but always circled back to my first love.
The Sony MDR-7506.
They just match my ears and I still have to find an HP which both allows me to easy split apart the various instruments and vocals, while at the same time causing zero fatigue on long listening sessions.
So, after many bought, and many sold (thanks eBay):
 
Sony MDR-7506
BD DT-880 Pro 250
AKG-K712 (sold)
Denon AH-D2000 (sold)
Hifiman HE-500 (sold)
ATH MH-50 (sold)
Shure SRH840 (sold)

1. Sennheiser HD800
2. Beyerdynamic DT880/600 (on sale)
3. Beyerdynamic DT770 pro/250 (for the office)
 
Edit: I'm going to replace my DT770 pro/250 and purchase a SRH/940.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: AKG Q701 and Sennheiser HD250 Linear II: Too close to call. Equally technically capable, Qs are a bit more natural but have bass roll off and upper midrange hiss, Linear II has better extension in both directions but can sound way too bright and bassy. Both have huge, intricate soundstaging and are very fast and clean. HD250 isolates like crazy. Q701 is prettier and feels nicer in the hands.
 
2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: There are some really nasty cup resonations going on in these, but they have a deeper soundstage than either of the above and are also a LOT more detailed and smooth sounding. With the right mods, these WILL be number 1.
 
3: Sony DR-Z7: Not all that impressive anymore, but still very unique. They're a tad slow with a bit of upper midrange bite that makes them sound faster than they are. They smear over low level information and can sound very blurry and confusing. Their treble extension is pretty poor, but they do not sound dark. The midrange and FR are both extremely smooth and they have very, VERY good decay characteristics (this adds to their speedy impression). Their soundstage is small and intimate, with very good separation. Distortion is fine, though the even orders might be a bit too high. They sound nice, quite nice, and I still use them, but they sound like headphones, while the above headphones sound "real".

1. grado es325 - super detailed and a great upfront presentation.  uncomfortable as sin
2. shure 840 - my first decent set of phones.  still the most "3d" set ive owned, and thats my favorite aspect of any of the sets i own.  i dont know if its a first love thing going on, but i keep finding myself coming back to them. i would love to find a higher detailed version of this with maybe a little more thump.
3. denon 2000 - comfy comfy comfy!  good sub bass, but probably my least favorite sound wise compared to the other two.  not as thumpy in the bass as the grado, not as dimensional as the shure, and detailing is probably on par with the 840.

How do these compare with the TH900? Also what amp are you using to drive them? Vintage amp via SE output? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Hey buddy,
 
Best headphone I've tried by far.  Open back which of course is different than TH900 and I did the open grill mod and put Audeze leather pads on it.  Amazing sound driven by either my Spec 2 amp or SX-1050 via speaker taps.  Had Ted @ HeadphoneLounge make me up a couple of connectors to mate up to my XLR connector. 
 
I have run it out of the headphone jack and it is good from the powerhouse amps (both of them listed above) but no comparison to out of the speaker taps.  Has to be experienced to believe.  The bass is just so visceral you can't believe it till you hear/feel it.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Beyerdynamic T1 - Excellent in retrieving details. Bass is very tight and well-controlled. Crystal clear mids and excellent 3D imaging. Works pretty well with O2+ODAC.
2. JH Roxanne - Headphone like soundstage. Bass presentation is similar to an LCD-2. With very natural sounding mid and highs. A very good compliment with T1. Isolation is excellent
3. Grado SR325e with tape mod - Fun, snappy sounding headphones. With the tape mod the bass hits harder. Soundstage is smaller than the T1.
4. Beyerdynamic T51p. - Natural sounding non-fatiguing phone. Perfect for long trips.
5. JH16Pro FP - Very good retrieving treble details. Bass quantity is solid. Very good for pump before starting your workout. Soundstage is very small compared to Roxanne.
6. Beyerdynamic DT250 - My reference neutral headphone.
7. Koss Porta Pro - Classic value for money. It's longevity speak for how good this phone sounds.
8. Grado SR80i - My first venture into Grado sound.
9. Beyerdynamic DT235 - Bang for a back headphone SQ-wise. Cheap build quality

I'm surprised the NADs are that low down, especially below the K545.
 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
I'm not.  I thought my old K550 was a lot better than my old HP50 (both in sound and comfort).  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Just recently bought 1 and sold 3, so it's time for a new list.
 
Grado RS1i
 
I listened carefully, at home to the new 1e version and while I think
it's better in some ways sonically, it's not better for my ears in
terms of comfort.  The cushions are too shallow, ears end up
almost sitting on the drivers themselves.
 
The 1i's continue to be a marvel of sonic delight.
 
 
Sony MDR Z7
 
New headphones, arrived about ten days ago.
Warm, detailed, beautiful soft high end.
And incredibly comfortable + well made.
Slightly pricey but worth it as it has no
direct competition of which I'm aware.
 
Sennheiser HD 650: SOLD
 
AKG K712 with "silver' custom cables.
 
Great sound, very comfortable.
They just don't get into all the nooks
and crannies, nor reach out as far to dazzle
as the Grado's and Sony's.
 
Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro 250
 
Great listening experience.
Need a good amp.
The K712's are just slightly more open,
slightly less tizz on top for a nicely smoother sound
with no loss of detail or impact vs the DT880's.
 
Cheers

Audio Technica ATH-ESW9A - Hi-fi Headphones that excentuate every spectrum of sound/music.
 
V-MODA M-100's - a little more biased towards the mids and lows but by no means a "bass-head" pair of cans, crisp and vivid highs.
 
Audio Technica A-900x - Good for it's price range and overall pretty fair-pair of cans (only problem, lows just aren't as forward or (for lack of a better word that comes to me at the moment) good as I expected. (I say good a lot bear with me I'm not a top notch reviewer >.<)
 
Audio Technica ATH-M50xBL - By no means a bad pair of headphones, Just can't beat the quality of my M-100's.

I value comfort pretty highly, and the HP50 just doesn't work well on my head. Though I'll admit that in hindsight the 650s are far and away the best. (I've spent some time with them on a decent amp and they've destroyed my other options for music.)

Well, you placed the 1e above the 1i in your list,
so I thought you  favored the 1e over the 1i.
But now I noticed you have them as 3a and 3b,
so I think it's reasonable to assume you rate 
them equally.
 
(I like the sound of the 1e a bit more, but
the 1i is far more comfortable for me.)

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Overall ranking (I listen mainly at home, classical music):
 
1) Hifiman HE-6:  Neutral sounding, very good detail.  One single drawback if you already have a headphone amp setup:  a bear to amp well and it does best with a low-power, low noise speaker amp.  Not very comfortable and it's heavy.
 
2) Sennheiser HD-800:  Extremely detailed and resolving, very comfortable, relatively neutral, treble sometimes a bit strident.  Drawbacks are the price and the fact that the detailed nature becomes a disadvantage if source quality is not optimal.
 
3) Hifiman HE-500:  90% of the HE-6 at half the price (1/4 the the price if you count the amplification), can be driven with a normal headphone amp.  Very good midrange and vocals, sounds a tad on the warm side.  Ideal with simple string music / vocals / jazz, not optimal with complicated works where there's a lot going on.  Cons:  not as detailed and resolving as its brother, sometimes a slightly veiled sound impression.
 
No longer with me (sold):
 
Beyerdynamic DT-880 in 600 Ohm edition:  Very good bang/buck, relatively detailed, 600 Ohm version plays very well with powerful tube amps.  The problem:  common with all Beyers I don't like its treble presentation, find it a bit on the harsh side.  Had to go as I already owned 3 headphones and this was the least of the bunch to me.

Yes. Alpha dogs has punchier bass, forgiving treble and an intimate midrange that's perfect for most modern recordings. While with the SR009 you sort of need the stars to align; it needs the perfect recording of the right type of music with the right-sounding gear to sound phenomenal. The SR009 is more finicky.

I'm listening to the F1 right now...only the HD800 is able to best the Sony.  
 
The F1 is more comfortable and has an even wider soundstage than the HD800.  Not bad for a little known can that was mostly ignored by the masses.

Did you remove the impedance compensator? there are a few posts about it and some say it sounds better once these are removed, but I never bothered - I enjoy them as they are, and I was afraid of ruining them...

No.   I ain't messing with this can since it would be hard to  get another one in good condition if I screwed up the modification. 
 
 
I'm trying to find a pair of replacement pads but I can't find them for sale anywhere.

I'll keep my eyes open, I should also get some for when mine start to crumble.
 
I remember seeing somewhere that someone was able to fit a Sony SA5000 pads on the F1, not sure how that would work though....

* = current
 
1*. Focal Spirit Professional (studio) - the newest addition - best headphones I have ever had, brilliant for assisting mixing down.
 
2. Sennheiser HD25 (DJ/Studio) - classic DJ headphones loved them when I had them.
 
3*. Sennheiser  PMX 685i (gym/running) - pretty decent sound, splash proof and secure, serve a purpose.
 
4. AKG K81DJ (DJ only) - good cans but broke on the swivel mechanism after only just over a year.
 
5*. Pioneer SE-DJ500 (DJ only) - These are a bit meh... I was fed up of shelling out big bucks for DJ cans and them breaking so I went for the SE-DJ500 years ago.  They have lasted very well but aren't up to scratch with the other DJ cans I've used for volume and clarity.  Will be replacing at some point.
 
6. Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80ohm (studio/listening) - Way too bass heavy and one channel went out of warranty.  Definitely not fit for critical listening, was disappointed with them and should have done some more research before buying.
 
7*. iPhone 2014 earbuds.  use them occasionally.  Not too bad, useful to hear things how other people do!

AT = Audio Technica. I don't plan on adding more to my collection. At this point I'll fool myself into thinking that I got the best sound I could possibly could.
 
AT ATH-AD2000X
AT ATH-A2000X (This one is actually more neutral, has more detail, clearer vocal, has deeper bass with bass boost, and frickin orgasmic to hear despite the slightly smaller sound stage when compared to AD2000X. It's 2nd on my list because it gets hot to wear because it's a closed can. You've got to try this can with a bass boost or a bass heavy song. Holy **** does it sound good!)
AT ATH-AD900X
AT ATH-A900X (My first real headphone into the headphone world. I bought this because I need a closed can for office use)
Koss KSC-75 (I don't own this anymore, they're all dead. Not buying them anymore either, they all have a reliability issue)
IEM - Westone UM3X (Frankly, this earphone is terrible despite the hype. This one has good bass, muddy okay highs, muddy mids. Serious lack of detail, soundstage is terrible. The list could go on. It's still better than my other earphones)
 
Below are headphones where the sound quality are simply intolerable to use for long time. I had people compare this to the KSC-75. No way these can come ANYWHERE close to the KSC-75.
Koss ProDJ100.
Monoprice DJ headphone.
IEM - Soundmagic PL50
IEM - Monoprice 8320
 
 
Are there any mods to make KSC-75 more rigid? KSC-75 is sensitive to shaking. Shake it too much/Accidentally hit the table with the Koss will loosen the internal cable to the driver, and after a while it will break. If i can make the driver stick more rigidly, it might fix things. I do like its sound signature, for its price.
 
Spoiler! Rant below (Click to show)
Putting this inside a spoiler since it is basically an useless clutter.
 
Time to start my rant. People at head-fi are sometimes just too positive, or too afraid to criticize some headphones. Bad SQ headphone 2,3 and 4 has been touted to be comparable to KSC-75. It doesn't come ANYWHERE close to it. I've also seen some members give opinions on headphones WITHOUT OWNING THEM. WTF? How do you give an opinion of its SQ without testing it? Somebody said the A2000x and the AD2000x are amplifier sensitive, yet I've tried 5 amplifiers with it, and there's not a single damn difference between them.
 
Now, the Westone UM3X. So much praises for this $500 earphone. When I tried it myself, I feel like wanting to shoot myself in the head for believing the hype. This was listening it WITH a bias that it's going to sound good. Boy, I wonder how it would have gone if I was fully pessimistic when I tried it on. It seems that the IEM community are less likely to own a headphone, so that might be the case.
 
I've been reading @takato14's posts. I guess I too, should go by measurements. I bought my ATs for comfort since I absolutely love the wing design. What I didn't expect is its sound will be the one to pull me in. My next headphone should be by measurement.
 
End rant.
 
I'm thankful for this thread, though I wish there are more high-end AT lovers.
 
EDIT: If anyone noticed from my post history, I praised the KSC-75 a lot. Things change over time though. I've been trying to decrease my bias, so my latest post is my current opinion of how these headphones rank. It does take a long testing time to form a solid opinion on which headphone you like better. Plus, the KSC-75 still sounds good.

^Uhh...as someone who's spent A LOT of money on ATs, you can't both solely rely on graphs and really enjoy ATs. Their magic is in the fact that they generally measure poorly but sound good (or at least unique) despite that.

Measurement is an estimation tool. I didn't say it's an end-all be-all tool. It's a way to save money. The AD2000x and the A2000x both measures well AND sound amazing, if you just ignore the bass. I almost hated the AD2000x because it wasn't as bright as the A900x but when I get used to it, it's just amazing. The AD2000X was barely in the +-10dB of the flat response.
 
Worth mentioning that both the AD2000x and A2000X has those peaks in its measurements that I could never replicate by EQ, and that the AD2000x barely gets the 'AT magic' because its mids are recessed but makes it up for it with the incredible sound stage and the fact that you get used to the mids over time. I'm not sure about the wooden series. I took a look at the W5000 and it doesn't measure well but there are people who like it.
 
In fact I took a look at the UM3X's (bought it without looking at the measurements) measurements and I could see why I hated it for the reasons I gave above. (Btw, the treble is okay, not muddy, but okay. It felt sparkly).
 
The best way is to try it yourself, of course. I don't deny this. I'm just saying that having the measurements is useful if you can interpret it. It will save you time and money. Not everyone has the chance to try out cans before buying.

I really haven't owned that many good heaphones!
1) ATH-M50 that I bought as a temporary replacement to my K701.  That was four years and one new pair of ear pads ago.  Still sound awesome, for closed cans!
 
2) "A headphone, no matter how good it sounds, if never used, is the worst one of all." -- me.  AKG-K701 that I absolutely loved the sound of but HAD to sell because the bumps on the headband tormented me worse than my ex-wife (but were at least easier to get rid of).
 
3) Sony MDR-7506 I bought when I thought my time needed to be spent more in mixing and mastering than listening.
4) Yamaha RH5MA, stupid cheap ($60) on-ear cans that are comfortable, portable, play nicely straight out of my phone, and match my ATH-M50 as closely as any cheap, on-ear can every will.
(AKG-K712 by the first of the year, hopefully (damn you, Harman Direct!), and either a pair of DT990 Pro or one of the Senn HD598/600/650 to compliment them soon.)

I'm kind of surprised you like the DT880 since you love the Sextett. I had both at the same time and thought they couldn't be more different. The Sextett has much more soul than the really dry-sounding DT880.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



The sextett is great, it's what got me into music again. I think what I am looking for is more of an out-of-head experience without using speakers. From a design of a normal pair of non-angled drivers in headphones, the DT880 600ohm does it pretty well. AKGs in general seem to really do that well anyway.

Is the K812 really that bad? I've heard nothing but good things up until now.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It's not unpleasant to listen to, but the Q701 bests it in almost every conceivable way at under 1/7th the cost. The only thing I can really think of that the K812 does better is bass extension. It is otherwise much rougher and less refined overall.
 
YMMV and all that ****, though I probably shouldn't have ranked it as low as I did on the second list. It's still a relatively nice sounding headphone.

That's interesting because my overall experience has been the opposite, the Q701, K712, etc. were noticeably rougher, less refined, etc. compared to the K812. The K812 is oddly picky of the system though as there were some systems where my K712 was smoother and less fatiguing.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The K812 may have some QC problems, btw. Tyll's two pairs measured quite differently and a couple highly regarded users (like MuppetFace) love their K812s. I am listening to the same unit Tyll measured here, which has measurably higher upper range distortion as well as peakier/rougher treble than the Q701 that he measured. I'd like it if MF could send her unit in, so we could see for sure, but she doesn't seem too keen on that...

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



It likely does have some quality check issues. The unit your listening to could be a somewhat bad one. Sounds like there is at least some variation going on. The unit I heard I found just as refined if not very slightly more refined than the HD 800 I heard. It's also an AKG which are notoriously picky and sensitive of the system so the problem can also be synergy related as well. The K812 was one of the pickiest headphones I have ever come across in terms of the system and source, I found it pickier than the HD 800, though not quite as picky as the K1000.Edited by kman1211 - 1/3/15 at 2:36pm

I have different uses for headphones, and there's lots of different ways to grade the cans, but when it comes to which ones do I wish I was wearing?
1) AKG 712 Pro              (so wish they were more portable)
2) PSB M4U1                 (still my go-to for songs with female vocals)
3) Sennheiser HD-25 1 ii  (The sound quality is decent, but the clamping force is real on these)

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

After doing a few power-related upgrades to my system, my rankings have changed a bit as more system upgrades come in this will change more.
 
1.) AKG K712 Pro: That weird haze/veil/grain in the upper midrange is finally gone, this is now my clearest and cleanest sounding headphone and is now non-fatiguing. Very natural sounding. Some extra energy in the upper treble.
 
2.) Sennheiser HD 600: Gorgeous midrange and beautiful tone, slightly loose bass.
 
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 150: Very clean and smooth sound, liquid smooth highs. Slightly too rounded sounding in bass.
 
? Sennheiser HD 545: Haven't tried on upgraded system yet.
 
? Fostex T50RP Haven't tried on upgraded system yet.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Here's my eclectic collection.  I picked all of these up thanks to the fine members of the Head-Fi Deals thread - I guess I should've paid attention to the "dangerous to your wallet" warnings.
 
The amp/DAC I'm using now is a Fiio E18.  Amplifier upgrades are my current priority.
 
1) AKG K7XX.  I decided that Santa would gift me these this year. :)  What attracted me to purchase was the focus on improving the perceived weak points of the AKG Annies/K702s that they're based on.  I jumped in early enough to get a sub-300 serial number model, for whatever that's worth.  The sound is just about everything I'm looking for.  Bass is solid without being bloated - kick drums have that "whumph" before impact.  Mids aren't recessed or forward, just nicely balanced.  Highs aren't too bright or fatiguing, and the only sibilance I hear is if the track was recorded that way.  It's fast enough to handle anything I've listened to without smearing.  Comfort is great; I could probably wear these for 12 hours straight and not complain.  Soundstage is wider than my closed cans but could be wider - I chalk this up to the velour pads and the Fiio.  The velour memory-foam pads isolate fairly well, but I think the trade off is they lose some of the space.
 
2) Grado SR60i.  These are the first set of headphones I truly loved.  Hundreds and hundreds of hours listening to these.  I prefer the L-Cush pads flipped around, but the S-Cush pads are good too.  Some time ago I picked up a set of the big salad bowl pads - they're the most comfortable but the sound is WAYY too bright!  I've been through Bilavideo's thread on Grado modding more than once and I'm dying to break these open and do some of the serious mods. Now that I have a new favorite in the 7XXs I'll be clearing time to dive in.  I love them like I love a beater car - the faults just give them personality.  The bass could use some authority, especially down really low, and there's a peak in the treble that moves around based on what pads are used - but put on some rock 'n roll guitars and crank it up loud and you can't help but love them.  Yeah, the cable is big enough to tow a sled and some people complain about the comfort (they fit me fine) but that just builds character...
 
3) Velodyne vTrue.  I purchased these last month when they were on sale for $90 shipped.  For that price they'd be worth it just to sit on a headphone stand and admired - the build quality on these is unbelievable.  Rich brown leather, brushed stainless steel, chrome accents.  I'll have to build a set of cables for these because the bright blue fabric on the stock cables looks silly connected to cans this classy.  They probably weigh more than any two of my other headphones but are comfortable enough to wear for about 2 hours before taking a break.  Sound - the bass on these is incredible.  Just unbelievably good, like you can't believe the sound is coming from headphones and not a stage PA.  Other headphones accurately produce sounds at these frequencies but the Velodyne has actual IMPACT - you can feel the slam from a kick drum as you hear it.  It's never bloated or bleeding over into the mids either - these are no blatty Beats. I can't recall anything that stands out from the mids or treble (probably because I'm going "wow! Listen to that bass!"), but while they might not be notable they're not doing anything offensive.  Negatives - The soundstage is about 4 inches wide, small even for closed-back headphones; I'm not a fan of the cables even though they're fabric and Velodyne obviously gave them some love; the weight is unavoidable but definitely a detriment. I haven't reached for these much because they seem to be a one-trick pony - but it's a great trick.  I think I'd absolutely love them if they were more balanced instead of so bass-forward so they'd be a great headphone with incredible bass instead of just a headphone with incredible bass.  Typing this out I realize that I sound like I'm saying "These are great but would be better if they were a completely different headphone."  I don't feel that way though - I'm thrilled with them.  I'll probably play with an EQ and try and bring them back in line, but even if that doesn't work I'll still pull them out whenever I want to listen to something that really SLAMS.
 
4) Sennheiser Momentum On-Ear.  Another incredible deal, $80 from Newegg.  These sound great and look great, which were Sennheiser's goals when they built these.  Larger soundstage than I'd expect from closed cans.  If I push them too far they bottom out and go BLAAT, but that's probably beyond safe listening levels.  The case and the cables are great, but I can clearly tell the difference between the cable with the mic/controls and the straight cable.  I'm having a hard time getting these to be comfortable on my ears, though.  They pinch at the top of the pinnae and therefore I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes or so.  The earcups just need to rotate more laterally, something that I'll solve by crimping the headband a little bit with pliers.
 
5) Shure SRH240.  Balanced more towards high/mids.  Bass is lean.  Vocals sound incredible on these, but everything else is kinda dry.  Least forgiving of all the headphones I own - anything wrong in the track is going to jump out instantly.  I guess that's why they're uses as studio monitors, right?  I like them enough to keep them, but not enough to use them regularly.
 
6)  Sennheiser HD439.  They're comfortable but I can think of little else to recommend them.  The bass has some impact but still manages to sound thin, and the bass is supposed to be the defining feature of these cans.  I opened them up to mod them by poking holes through the acoustic fabric covering the venting holes behind the driver, but opened up just one on each side.  This brought out the bass somewhat but now they sound muddy.  I keep them in my desk at my office, where I can't do any serious listening anyway.  I liked the Sennheiser HD202 II set that I had previously, but I gifted these to a coworker and can't bring myself to ask for them back.
 
7) Sennheiser HD229.  I plug them in and sound comes out.  They don't do anything to offend my ears, but don't do anything to move me either.  I guess my rating is "Meh."

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Audio Technica ATH-M50
- Clear highs, deep lows. Sounds great unamped, and amped it becomes a monster. Velour pads made these even better. Soundstage is a bit annoying. Feels a bit inverted and always inside my head.
 
2) Audio Technica ATH-AX1IS
- Similar sound to the M50 (lower quality, but the sound signature feels mostly the same), but a very portable light version. The clamping force is my only issue with it. I think if I stretched it out a bit I'd love it a lot more.
 
3) Skullcandy Aviator
- Sounds pretty bad at high volume. Sharp highs with a weak treble. It's a strange combination that does not sound good. The bass tries too hard and becomes a muddy mess. What's surprising to me is how good this headphone sounds at lower volume levels though, it's like everything that was bad with the volume high goes away at 50% volume or less. At first I thought it was just the source, but seems that anything I use it with sounds the same, even amped. Used this pair at work for a long time, very durable, very comfortable.
 
4) Sony MDR-XB500
- High pressured and boomy. Used this pair for around 5 hours, then never again. I thought I was all about the bass at first when I started getting better headphones, turns out I am not all about that bass. After adjusting the EQ to sound more reasonable, the seal just made my ears too hot. It also made it feel like there was a lot of pressure from the sound due to the isolation. Taking the headphones off after listening felt like being in an airplane that finally got back to the ground and my ears thanked me.

Hello

I didn't read all the pages of this post  but a question seems very important to me : which headphones for which use ?
for instance, as a (french) sound engineer, if I am mixing music, my favorite ones are the sony mdr sa 5000. Because they are so detailed and as far as I know and have tested headphones, no other one can give this so excellent balance for mixing. mix with a sr007 from stax, and if you listen to the result with other headphones it will be strange or even messy, and not at all what you intended to mix. but mix with the sa5000 and the result will be perfect on all other heapdhones. so, it is defficult to give a good rate , not knowing what use for what headhones. the sa 5000 are far not the most pleasant to just listen to music
if we are just talking about listening to music, here is my rating between the headphones I own
1 stax lambda signature

7  Sennheiser hd 580 precision ( second on my list after the sa 5000 for mixing)
8 Audiotec CES. a very rare model, and historical. When it was released, said on newspapers  to be better than the stax srx mark III. And I think it is a bit better, in fact. More detailed in the highs

I forgot to add my akg k 242 whixch I would rank very close to the sennheiser hd580, maybe just after.
also, I used to have an  akg k701 wich I found rather poor sounding. I would rank it at tenth position and the bose eleventh

1) Hifiman HE500
2) ZMF x Vibro
3) Sennheiser HD600
 
Driven from a NFB 11.32 - I know not exactly "high end" dac/amp.
 
 
I tend towards a dark/warm sound signature myself. I've tried a lot of cans like the HD800, TH600, Beyer T1 but the the treble kills my ears quite a bit with my type of music - which is understandable as they show up the flaws. Also I can't budget for summit level amps and dacs. I'm mostly into Metal, 70s Rock, 90s Alt and Grunge and 90s Goa + Psy-trance stuff. I'm far from a bass head as well, the TH600 was too much for me. LCD cans are beyond my weight tolerance - too uncomfortable for me. I don't think I'd ever spend more than $6-700 on a headphone.
 
Hopefully the Oppo PM-3 works out. The PM-3 looks like my perfect headphone for portable usage, both in looks/design and form factor.

in a pm, a head-fier tells me
“Amazed you rank the K340 so highly... I love mine un-modded too!”
Hi , yes, they are really wonderful headphones. but not on any music. And that doesn't depend on it to be classical or modern or whatever. is depends ont the recording, probably, but I never could figure out how it comes to be so good on some songs and rather pleasant but not exceptionnal on others. It played wonderful on a rachmaninov concert,  and really top on technotronic, also... hard to understand. Needs a good power anyway.

That's quite a collection. I'm surprised the Baby Orpheus are rated this low (though it's up against some tough competition!). I'd love to hear it one day.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

there is no low heaphone in this list, in fact, but it is true that when you put the baby orpheus next to the two stax there is no comparison possible. I was told many things about the baby, that is why I took them. They are of course very good headphones, but...
btw, an info that could be important for some baby orpheus owners. it is said on this forum to have a known issue with dust. so I asked spritzer, who is an expert here, and who very kindly told me that one could avoid that puting over the drivers thin plastic like mylars. I did. spritzer told me that it would not affect the sound. but in fact it does very much on the voices. I am a voice talent, so I often record a capella voices. and there is a big difference with the nylon sheets. I told Spritzer about it, and he was rather surprised. but he hadn't tryied with a capella voices.
anyway, of course, it is a pleasure to listen to the baby o's. but once you have heard these other ones on my list, you make the difference.
I d really like to try the beyer t1. and the koss 950. do you know how they compare to the list I gave ?
thanks

I'd like to add an odd story I went through. Maybe this is not the place to post it... Anyway, when I bought the sr 007, i came to the seller's house with my stax trm t1 amp and my lambda signature pro headphones to hear the difference. the seller had a sr007, then, and a sr009, and a srm 006 amp. must have been the ts because it seemed totally brand new and modern. I plugged my lambda in it and in my tr r1, and could easyly notice that the sound was much better with my trm 1. tried the same with the sr 007, and it was the same. better with the trm1.I told it to the seller, who, very surprised, tried too.... And said the same. then, he started to hesitate selling is 007... but he finally did. a month after, he wrote to me to ask if I would like to buy his 006 amp , because he had just bought a better one (which was not a trm 1) . of course, I reminded him of what had happened, and said I was not interested in buying an amp which would not be as good as mine...
 I found it funny. I made lots of tests this very day, and I know I made comparisons with the 009 too. But I am not sure of which amp sounded better with it. Can't remember well, because it was not my point and prefered the 007. 
good info, isn't it ?

You seem to change your rank of headphones every few days and post it here?  Is that your taste changing that quickly?
 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


No, I've just been getting a lot of gear in the mail. I sent some headphones to Tyll for measurements, ranked what I had left out of boredom, then got a pair of K812s as a loaner and re-ranked, then got all of the headphones I sent out back, and then got the SS-100 in the mail and re-ranked.
 
This all happened within the scope of a week and a half. Lol.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

i am maybe just a little bit curious how the k812s sound
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Still quite the novice here, but I think I have a nice little list for someone looking where to start:
 
1.) AKG K702
2.) Sennheiser HD 25 - still pretty fantastic for how old they are
3.) Grado SR225e
4.) Audio Technica ATH-M50
 
Just to give you an idea, I've been running pretty much all of these through my Schiit Vali/Modi 2 stack. The K702's are something else, very detailed. I would recommend at least trying the bass mod (for any of the 701's and 702's) because they do compliment the sound of the un-modded 702's, but of course, it's just my opinion.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Take a Q701, give it more low bass and high treble, but at the cost of higher grain, lower detail, and some slight tizz. It's definitely more "hi-fi" sounding in signature, as the Q701 always sounded a bit mid-centric to me, but it's not as transparent or realistic and the upper ranges are very rough. Not unpleasantly so, but definitely not natural or accurate. It's a trade-off. 
 
Which it shouldn't be, given the exorbitant price, but a lot of what you're paying for is construction. The K812 is a beautifully made headphone that sounds the same out of basically anything; think of it like AKG's PM-1/2.

You seem to like Sony headphones.   Have you ever heard an MDR-F1?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

LOVE my F1's... 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


No F1, because I need some noise cancelling and the already "openess" nature of porous diap. sound, besides I don't like "plastic" diaphragms.
I love the SONY innovation of angled drivers and porous biocellulose/nano HD diaphragms.
Only those porous diap. can reproduce the natural airy transients SQ like IRL Sounds I hear to compare, despite abit "uncontrolled" brightness. I can't go back to those "airproof plastics".
BTW here's compatible earpads altough it has broader edges but you can rip off the inner foam:

I don't but here's one: http://www.sonicstudios.com/mdr-f1.htm
-
The stock SA5000 sounds bad, to me without modding it was too direct, piercing, spiking, thin, sharp highs tsss, earsbleeding fatiques, can't listen longer than 1 hr.
As you can see the porous diaphragm is paperlike and will sounds paperlike.
Only after some damping and the "closed back" mods and replacement with SA3000 drivers (less piercing, more bass than SA5000 due without the extra thick black felt ring at the back of SA5000 driver) to tame the piercing and retain the bass, I was satisfied, everything sounds airy, controlled and "livelike", so finally I can listen to it for 8+ hrs (uninterrupted) with pleasure.
But the soundstage is very close-in and not deep, not far away, sounds concentrate mostly in the center/top/left/right and front/back is mostly absent without Surround processing or 3D headrecording/HRTF.
But it sounds livelike as you are really in the action scene itself with movie/games/concerts etc.
But if you can't do modding and like loud volume and EQ sounds, these are not for you as these diaphragm can't stand loud volume as it will sound literally like tearing up a papersheet.
Due the bass distortion reaching almost 10% at 90/100dB will tear down whole Freq. spectrum, but to me at moderate volume approx. 55dB is loud enough.
Measurements at: http://www.innerfidelity.com/headphone-data-sheet-downloads
Try flapping, tearing and ticking etc. to a thin blank printing papersheet (with visible porous structure) to hear its soundlike signature.
-
If you really want to try porous diap. with less (piercing) treble and carefree without using headamp, connecting to portable/light sources, than the Aurvana Live 1 will be a good start:http://www.amazon.com/Creative-EF0060-Aurvana-Live-Headphones/dp/B000ZJZ7OA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421317469&sr=8-1&keywords=aurvana+live
nvm I see you have D2000 which has the better bigger same type CAL drivers, so with SA3000/SA5000 will be a hit or a miss.Edited by cdsa35000 - 1/15/15 at 6:23am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



HD600 - My favourite all time HP
 


T1 - My 2nd favourite HP - better than the HD800 IMHO
 


HD650 - My 2nd-(b) favourite - w/some recordings they're unequaled
 


SRH1540 - Excellent HP - last but not least
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
So, you basically think that the HD600 is better than the HD800? 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I will answer plainly : Yes FOR ME, to my ears & taste.  I owned the HD800 twice w/very good sources & amps ie. GS-1 & the HD800 sound is just not for me.  That's the best answer I can give you.  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Not THAT surprising, the HD600 has less tonality problems than the HD800 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I have never heard the HD600 but I have heard the HD800 a lot with my friends on the best amps etc. It's probably one of the best headphones on planet earth but I also think it's probably not the one I would enjoy the most. That would be probably the TH900. Depends on your musical taste and what you enjoy in headphones. 
 
However, if I had the HD800 I would certainly not sell it either, it's near perfect in sound reproduction/recreation and for some genres I would LOVE it to bits.
 
Cheers,
K
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I'd take my K7XX over the HD800 any day... HD800 treble was a killer, and I didn't want to mod such an expensive headphone. Also I wouldn't call it a great all-rounder, K7XX I like with nearly all music I've tried it with.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Yep, that's how different people and their tastes are. I listened for two weeks to a K701 and had a Q701 myself. Both were "nice" but I couldn't get myself to listen to them, something was always missing, couldn't put my finger on it. Anyhow, I ended up selling my Q701 and I don't miss it.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: Sansui SS-100: Ortho HD600 with bass. Same general signature, better low and high end extension, better control, better transients. Cleaner; less grain/distortion. Airier. Less comfy. My favorite listening experience so far.
 
2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (modded): Not much done to it yet, just some foam to eat up the enclosure resonances. Close to the SS-100, but less flat. Still some earcup resonation B/S. Equivalent distortion figures, better power handling. Bass doesn't dig quite as deep, but hits harder. Very comfy. Isolates well. Good for portable.
 
Everything else has been obsoleted...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Now that the collection has been paired down:
 
1. HE 500 with Cardas Fatpipe, FocusPads, grill and Fuzzor mod.
 
2. RS1i recabled with HPL Silver Ray 
 
3. SennGrado in Cocobolo cups with Yew Audio quad OCC cable
 
 
*It's a little crazy how close the SennGrado is to the RS1 sometimes...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) Sennheiser HD 650: Full, rich, clean, smooth, and thick. Very musical and euphoric. More articulate, faster, and more euphoric and musical than the HD 600.
 
2.) AKG K712 Pro: Spacious, powerful, detailed, quite neutral with a little extra aggression up top. Excellent extension both ways. I prefer the HD 650's tuning to this headphone slightly. 
 
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 150: Pretty much a closed-back HD 650, but a bit cleaner and slightly different tonality. The sound isn't quite as 3D as the two headphones above but it's a bit cleaner sounding. I don't like it's tonality quite as much as the two headphones above.
 
4.) Sennheiser HD 600: A slightly brighter and slightly less bassy sound than the HD 650 but pretty much slightly inferior to the HD 650 in almost every way, harsher, less refined, less 3d sounding, slower, etc. Pretty close to the HD 650 but just not quite as good. A little more balanced sounding than the HD 650.

Wait? Do you live in Michigan like your profile picture shows? When I get back once college breaks out for the late spring, I have to go to a Head-Fi meet-up sometime just to listen to your headphones. Michigan and Utah have practically no audio shops that carry audiophile headphones, let alone obscure, retro ones which carry a certain mystique.

I would definitely appreciate it! I have just posted a list of headphones I have demoed or owned in another thread. This is it:

I just sold the HD600 and I liked it but... yeah, just wasn't for me.
 
I would rank the few I own right now like this. The last three are actually back at my permanent address in Michigan:
 
1. (Soon to repurchase) Beyerdynamic DT 860 -- I loved it so much I have to re-buy it. Much to my regret, I had sold it to fund a non-headphone-related purchase, but it is my favorite sub-$500 headphone at this point. It is being discontinued, sadly. In my honest opinion, it is one of the most underrated headphones here.
 
2. Superlux HD681 -- hot, spicy, zippy treble but it is extremely fun and surprisingly neutral sounding at the same time.
 
3. Sennheiser HD 201 -- The headphone that is real reason for me being in this hobby. My parents were at Guitar Center getting guitar equipment and I was demoing headphones and I fell in love with this. I was just barely a teenager at the time and I asked if I could get these headphones with the money I had saved up. I bought them, and not but a half year or so later, I was donning a pair of HD555s. These are not very good sounding at all to me now that I have familiarized myself with many, many more models of headphones, but they are much better than the Beats and sealed Sony's I have tried.
 
999. Sony MDR-CD30 -- From my pre-audiophile era, this was bought at garage sale way before the time I knew anything about DACs, open-back headphones or outboard amplifiers. They are pretty terrible sounding; congested, grainy, muddy, lifeless--in short, better than maybe $3 Coby's but even that is perhaps stretching things a bit.

I have to remind myself to try the F1's. I just looked up today, in fact, to see what exactly were the pair of Sony headphones I see everyday in a room in my university's math building--these are it! I will try to contact the owner tomorrow to see if I can demo them.

I'd considered the T1, but hadn't quite got around to buying it......though I'm getting an AKG K812 to compare it against my HD800 and LCD2. Coincidentally, I have a HD700 as well and I love it, I don't get why there was, and is, so much hate for it. As stated, I'll revise my rating when I get the K812, and as an added bonus, I'll be getting a HE400i at the same time......so stoked, more shiny new stuff to play with! 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I strongly agree with you HD700 is a great headphone. Far better than HD600 and light years away for comfort. It sounds slightly dark side but I think it's a great set of cans. Underrated.

The HD700 is a lot of things, but dark?

I've heard them be both dark and bright. Depends on the system behind them in my experience. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


This makes me regret for not having demoed the HD 700 when I was at Sweetwater in Fort Wayne, Indiana, last summer. I just wanted to demo the HD 800 so much that I totally forgot about them.
 
By the way, I can't wait to demo HiFiMAN's in Michigan! A fellow Michiganian forumer in the HE-1000 thread informed me that Overture Audio in Ann Arbor now carries HiFiMAN planar dynamics. Most people like me would not have known at all about this since their site still shows them only carrying Grado Labs, so I am quite happy for the insider information and the prospect I have of listening to them when I come home this spring. Maybe this is wishful thinking, but them having a HE-1000 demo unit would be the bee's knees...

They're not. The HD650 will probably start sounding better pretty soon. The Sextett is kind of a "wow" headphone... surprises you at first but then its flaws become apparent. Unless, of course, the HM5 pads make a stupidly massive difference.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I got a pair of Sennheiser HD650s yesterday and so far I prefer my HD598s. I guess I should give the 650s a little more listening time.
 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I wouldn't be surprised if the HD 650 sounds better to me long term, I'll see how things turn out. One thing is for sure the headphone is exceptionally clean sounding. Well honestly the headphone seemed a bit unfocused spreading the vocals and bass out a bit too much until I tube rolled and that got the overly diffuse sound of the vocals and bass under control. What did you find the flaws of the headphone were?

That is definitely the first time I've read that.  Don't get me wrong, I have a soft spot in my heart for the 598 as it my first foray into this mess, but after hearing the 600 and 650, I never picked the 598 up again.  However I do respect your honesty - a lot of people would have simply chosen the flavour of the month and gave in to peer pressure. I for one preferred the 600 over the 650.

It sounded highly tizzy, out of control, and etched to me, with disappointing bass extension and a thinner midrange than I was expecting. Very nice staging, good transients, good clarity, but too cold and loose for my tastes. Clean was not a term I would've used to describe them.
Edited by takato14 - 1/27/15 at 11:26am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I don't really have those problems with them after tinkering with pads and tube rolling except some minor control issues. With the stock pads and another system the headphone would sound out of control and be what you described them, the headphone needs to be beaten into submission and brought into focus. The midrange is definitely cooler than I expected but the pads and some resonance reducing dampening under the pads really helped bring the headphone into focus and made it a bit warmer, a bit more dampening can make them almost too warm. Don't have any issues with bass extension, it has plenty of sub-bass. I have learned from experience AKGs are often very dampening dependent. I just found they have a good amount of potential that can be squeezed out, I find it a headphone worth experimenting with.

How we all hear differently
I never would describe a Sextett as tizzy, etching, out of control, with disappointing bass extension and thinner midrange than expected. More the opposite....
To my ears they are one of the best sounding (semi) open headphones. The DT 150 and ZMF the best closed backs.
That is, among those I had a listen to. Of course there are better sounding ones, but I'm not willing to spend a fortune on headphones in order to find out.

Absolutely not.
I have just dealt with headphones stores owners during some previous travels (in HK, China & Japan) for the most rarest ones.
Otherwise, my collection was done with online auctions (real tough competition from other collectioners).

This is a bit off-topic but related to something someone mentioned earlier. I just got off the phone with Overture Audio. Not only does Overture Audio in Michigan carry HiFiMAN high-end headphones, they also carry the Abyss! Now, it is not a question "if." I WILL be visiting Overture Audio as soon as I get back from college in late April. I can't wait... AHHHH!!! :D
 
EDIT: I found this on their Facebook page. They must have recently remodeled and expanded their stock of headphones in 2013.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Here's my list: 
 
1) Logitech G930 
2) ATH-PRO500MK2
3) Beats SOLO2 
 
I have em but I don't actually like any of them (bad impulse buys) but I'm ranking them based on how they sound and their comfortability. The G930s are a great pair of gaming-hps but the fact that they're plagued with software issues (wireless keeps cutting out and doesn't work that well on cable either) really bothers me. Not as much as the second on my list, which imo is a fit too tight for my head (I also wear glasses so it hurts even more). Beats are, well.. They're beats. They're SiB atm but I've tried them out in stores but I don't really like them either. If forced to choose one, I would probably go with the G930s.
 
Also, I'm new, nice to meet the community! :) 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Hifiman HE-500 takes the top spot from the Grado 325i.
2. Grado 125i w/ Vibro cups. I use it for one genre: jazz.
3. Grado SR40. Good with my tablet.

A revised ranking of the cans I have at hand as of now....my taste and preference's pretty fickle.
1. Sennheiser HD800 (the soundstage!)
1. AKG K812 (more intimate but as detailed as the HD800.....to my ears anyway)
3. Audeze LCD2
4. Sennheiser HD700
4. HiFiMan HE400i (just got it, but liking what I hear)
6. Beyerdynamic DT990/600 (clear highs, nice bass boost)
7. MrSpeakers Alpha Dog (somewhat less detailed sounding to me, but very creamy sound, great for simply chilling)
8. Audio Technica ATH-AD2000 (very detailed sounding, but highs is a tad harsh)
9. V-Moda Crossfade M100 (used mainly when on the go, but sometimes for punchier songs to chill to, and gaming as well)

The K812s have got to be one of the most polarizing phones out there, also, nice collection!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Not gonna get any new headphones for awhile so here we go:
 
1. HD700 (I know, I know)
2. K712
3. HE-400
4. HE-400i
5. W3
6. HD598
7. X1
8. HD650 (I know... I KNOW!)
 
I'm obviously a sucker for soundstage, sparkling treble, and deep extended bass. I tried to hard to like the 650 but miserably failed... too slow, too claustrophobic, too mellow. I returned pretty much everything except for the 700, 650, W3 and 598 though, and I have a feeling the WA7 coming in will change my impressions of the 650 (while toning down 700's treble fatigue).

1) Hifiman HE400i
2) ZMF X Vibro
3) Sennheiser HD600
 
The K702 and DT990 eventually went because I grew tired with the brighter/more grating sound as I've been delving into a lot of grunge, hardcore punk and 70s rock stuff. I'm changing my tastes toward a darker sound again.

Thanks, but honestly, I love the sound of the K812 from the git go, the clarity can only be matched by the HD800 (in my collection), though the soundstage isn't as wide, it makes for a better rendition of 'intimate' tracks. I'm listening to Linda Ronstadt's 'Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind' album and it's excellent.
 
Anyway, I'm done collecting cans, time to focus on amp/dacs.

How do you think HD800 + Valhalla 2 compare to HD700 + WA7? They cost pretty much the same roughly, one with more money going to the headphones and another more money going to the amp. Both will be run via my STX II DAC, except that the WA7 will be using its own DAC. I'm interested in how the HD800 sound as well, but I've read that unless you have a lot of good gear already, getting the HD800 is pointless. I'm currently enjoying the HD700 very much, and still waiting for the WA7 from the recent massdrop.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The HD800 will slaughter the HD700 out of anything. The HD800 isn't as hard to drive as some would have you believe; it's just ridiculously transparent and can rip things apart like no other. It sounded damn fine out of my AudioQuest Dragonfly (v1) when I tried it at a meet. About as good as the enormous Audio-GD SA-31 that was sitting on the table next to the 'phones.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Agreed, I have both the HD800 and HD700, while both have their strengths and weaknesses, the former has great clarity, transparency and das awesome soundstage! From what I've been told, when it comes to sound differences, headphones > amp > dac. I'm NOT saying the HD700 is bad, far from it, I enjoy it for certain genres of music.....I find myself relaxing more and enjoying the music (rather than listening to just the sound, that is, being analytical) than with my HD800, which I tend to listen to the sound rather than the music. I hope you get what I'm trying to say in my newbish way....
Edited by mikey1964 - 2/6/15 at 8:47pm 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I agree with this. The HD800 sounds pretty darn fine out of just about any source that can give it adequate volume. The true magic lies in the fact that no matter what you upgrade between the music and the HD800, you'll notice it right away, and it will scales up almost indefinitely upwards as you upgrade your source and amps and such. It isn't picky like some would have you believe. Most people say that because to their own tastes, the HD800 doesn't match the particular sound signature they were expecting.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Hd800 are not difficult to drive as many amp can power them adequately but still you need the right one.
What is nice is that you don't need to invest into a 4-digits amp to make them sound good! Something like valhalla 2 will make a great combo. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Isn't the C5 a portable amp? I'd have to check the specs of the C5, but not even my Audio-GD NFB-15 can do a good job of driving mine.  I have to use the headphone out of my Nakamichi to give those cans the juice they need to shine.  If a portable amp can drive those beasts, that very impressive and I have to find one to demo. The DF's are definitely something special!  
Edited by BlueRequiem - 2/7/15 at 12:05am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It is a portable amp but it's extremely powerful. It's considerably more powerful than anything else I've owned. I bought it because none of my other amps could sufficiently drive my recently purchased HE560. Now it drives them beautifully, something even the headphone out of my old Arcam Alpha integrated amp couldn't do. Yes, it's PLENTY power for the K240 DF, believe me. Also, the bass boost is subtle and just fills out that bottom end on the DFs in a way they need. They are getting the headtime they've never had now!
I had a cable made to run my HE560 from the speaker taps of that Arcam amp and that is a step up yet again but for portability and convenience, the C5 leaves me wanting for absolutely nothing! 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Wow, that is really impressive, I'll have to check out the C5 sometime by the sounds of it! I've never had problems with bass extension with my DF's, but then again I like AKG's a lot (and I haven't had the pleasure to compare any of them to current planars like your HE560).
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Makes me want to reconsider my WA7 purchase. If it turns out that it doesn't improve my sound that much, I might as well spend that money on an upgrade from the 700 to the 800, then use the left over to get a valhalla 2 or a lyr 2 to use with my 800 and 650.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Even the WA7 didn't quell the HD800 treble enough for me, just not my cup of tea at all.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Any of you HD-800 guys using vintage amps?  I'd be curious how well they sound.  I know they drive my HE-6 better than you can imagine.

The X2s are my new go-to HPs for classical music. More open then my HD650s. At least to me. I actually preferred my HD598s for classical before the X2s came along.
 
It's very hard to do an accurate comparison of the X2s to my Sennheisers. The X2s are so much more efficient and require much less power.
 
Don't get me wrong, I still love my HD650s for other kinds of music, but for classical the X2s are just superb.

some new entries here - including an MDAC to plug them into 
 
1) HD600 - still the king, loves the Audiolab
2) T70p - king of treble, and with my old musicians ears I need it. NOT for bass lovers
3) D2000 - the ying to the T70ps yang, yet not rolled off or dull, everyone who hears this loves this headphone
4) DT1350 - Its getting closer but this is still the king of the portables
5) ATH-ES10 (ESW11 pads) - just a little less bass and bit more above 10k would make these number 4
6) Vmoda XS - growing on me, super comfy and very portable, sonically related to the ES10
7) Momentum (blue) - not impressed on first listens, need some more tries, lacks treble.

I don't like the HD598 for classical. Compared to the L2, they are noticeably less clear. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I only own a few, because if they aren't great for me, I don't keep them.
 
1.  Sennheiser HD600.   Best of the bunch, Detail and soundstage galore.  Analytical yet relaxing at the same time.  no fatigue, best for hours and hours of listening.
 
2.  RHA M750-  My favorite IEM, with PFE tips.  Fantastic sub-bass,  smooth but detailed mid-range, extended treble but never harsh.  Needed he PFE tips, because I couldn't get any of the supplied tips to seal well.
 
3.  Audeo PFE - own several pairs of these, and lots of the filters and tips.  These were my only IEM for a long time.   I had tried some more expensive ones (by a factor of 3 or more) but didn't come across any that sounded this good.  The ability to tune the sound with the filters is a great idea.  Crystal clear, great soundstage, nice bass but need a slight boost to bring out the sub-bass.  Nearly indestructable.
 
4.  AT ATH-AD900X.   These were ny only full-size can for a long time.  with the pad and rubber band mod getting a good seal and enough clamping force, their bass is actually very good, extends into the sub-bass and is quick and detailed.  Mid-range detailed and a little cool.  The X version of these phones has less treble energy than the original, I find it very balanced, with no sibilance.  I don't find the soundstage on these to be as good as most people do.  Its the narrowest of the phones I own.
 
 
Phones I didn't keep:  AKG-K701 (I found these unlistenable, way too sibilant, poor bass, maybe I just don't have the right gear), AT M50x (good sound overall but just too uncomfortable and I couldn't see them getting enough ear time),  AT ATH-AD900 (great sound overall, but too sibilant, sold to buy the X version), HD580 (sold them, stupidly, after enjoying them for years, becasue I wasn't using headphones anymore),  Shure  IEM's up to the SE530 (none of them I found to be very good, all lacking in some way, usually in the treble department and just a poor value).  MEElec 151 and 161P - meh, they were OK, but nothing special so I moved them on.

blow me <3
But no, the 10-II has what appear to be irreparable linearity problems in the FR as well as some driver-bourne ringing. The portapro is cleaner, has a better soundstage, and possibly even better detail... for what it is, it's remarkably impressive, and that's why I ranked it so high. The 10-II has much nicer bass and sounds smoother and more relaxed, and also has better extension and power handing, but it can sound dull when compared to the other three. It's more of a taste thing, and right now I'm more focused on mids than bass.
Once I get the SE-450 from you, GREQ, I'm gonna try modding the 10-II again, but I'm pretty sure it's already at 100% in stock form. The only thing left to try would be a driver transplant... :x

Gonna have to revise my ranking a little, after giving the ATH-AD2000 more listening time, I now find the treble to be acceptable (though most might find it too harsh). What I've discovered about the AD2000 is the vocals, it handles vocals quite well.....heck, I find it more detailed and vocals outshines my other cans. Hence, it's gone up in my ranking:
1. Sennheiser HD800 (the soundstage!)
1. AKG K812 (more intimate but as detailed as the HD800.....to my ears anyway)
3. Audeze LCD2
4. Sennheiser HD700
4. HiFiMan HE400i (just got it, but liking what I hear)
4. Audio Technica ATH-AD2000 (very detailed sounding, but highs is a tad harsh, but vocals is lovely)
7. Beyerdynamic DT990/600 (clear highs, nice bass boost)
7. MrSpeakers Alpha Dog (somewhat less detailed sounding to me, but very creamy sound, great for simply chilling)
9. V-Moda Crossfade M100 (used mainly when on the go, but sometimes for punchier songs to chill to, and gaming as well)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



What do you like about the MDP that puts it above the HD650? I haven't yet tried an MDP or Alpha, but I never thought the MDV3 measured up that well to my HD650.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I like the fuller sound of the the Mad Dog Pros...It's more musical to me than the HD650.  The HD650 is more detailed but it's too laid back. 
 
Also the HD650 soundstage doesn't impress me (the Alessandros may have spoiled me)...The MDP has surprisingly good soundstage.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

In order of preference. Top headphones may not what I consider my best sounding headphone but rather simply what I use the most due to comfort and what is easiest on my ears. 
 
1.) Sennheiser HD 650: My most used headphone, very easy on the ears and laid-back but also one of my most refined headphones and scales up like crazy. Slightly more refined than the HD 600. Can be a bit too laid-back at times. Superb comfort.
 
2.) Sennheiser HD 600: This headphone has grown on me, I've had a love hate relationship with this headphone since I got it, but finally got the synergy right. Sounds more natural than the HD 650 but not as refined overall. Just as easy on my ears as the HD 650. Virtually same comfort as HD 650.
 
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 150: This is what I consider my most refined and best sounding headphone in terms of pure sound quality this headphone is #1. Think a closed-back HD 650 but deeper bass, better mids, better treble, cleaner sound, blacker background, better dynamics, and more transparent with a soundstage just as large. It's easier on my ears sonically than the HD 650 even, it's a closed-back HD 650 that is better sounding than the HD 650. The bass can be simply phenomenal on these. Only reason this is number three is due to comfort, it's not uncomfortable but it gets too sweaty at times and fit is a tad awkward. 
 
4.) AKG K712 Pro: Honestly I think this headphone sounds slightly better than both the HD 650 and HD 600 in many aspects and comfort is great. Tonality is similar to the Senns but more spacious, tight, precise, and has the best dynamic range of all my headphones. The dynamics, soundstage, and imaging are what truly stand out with this headphone. The slightly prominent treble causes some problems for me at times though and can be a little sharp sounding on certain recordings, so I mainly use these for high quality recordings and uncompressed audio. Extremely picky headphone.
 
5.) Sennheiser HD 420 SL: This headphone is less articulate than the headphones above and is an on-ear but is a real treat to listen to, it's my most musical headphone and has fantastic mids and treble, may actually be my most transparent headphone despite not being as articulate and refined as the 4 above. The thing simply disappears and sounds freakishly real. Bass is slightly lacking in excursion factor though. Most comfortable on-ear I have ever worn.
 
6.) Sennheiser HD 545: I don't use this headphone much, not because I don't like it but because the pads deteriorated and I don't like swapping pads between them and the HD 600. Think a brighter, more spacious, more efficient, and slightly less-refined HD 600 but still warm in the mids and interestingly more musical than either the HD 650 or HD 600 but not quite HD 420 SL musical. Easy on the ears despite being on the bright side. Probably my most comfortable headphone, basically a less-clamply HD 6xx. Ranking may change if they had pads of their own.
 
7.) AKG K240 Sextett LP: Good headphone but don't use it much due to comfort reasons(loose elastics due to age and somewhat uncomfortable pads) and honestly not sure what to think of it's sound, never heard anything like it before. 
 

There are a couple more headphones but don't feel like they deserve to be listed.Edited by kman1211 - 2/24/15 at 4:15am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Let's see...very hard to choose. At Number 1 I think I'd have to go with:
 
1. Beyer DT880 Pro.
 
2. This is a tough one, but again: Beyer DT880 Pro.
 
3. And finally, last but not least, Beyer DT880 Pro.
 
All this deciding has drained me, but it's been worth it.    
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Right now I'd go with:
 
1. AKG K7XX - great all-rounder with excellent comfort means it's my go-to headphone
2. Alessandro MS2e - still my favourite for metal/rock but I can only wear it for an hour or so before I get discomfort
3. Audio Technica AD2000x - I enjoy the sound, it's different to my other 2 headphones and use it occasionally but I generally reach for the AKG instead.

I've read too many reviews stating that the T1 is not a serious enough upgrade on the DT880, merely incremental. Even that the T1s treble is more annoying. Besides, I don't have a spare $1200.

Haha. Like your post. But the thread title says: Rank the headphones that you OWN. So I guess his ranking would be correct. But for me the DT880 wouldn't make the list (sold them) but the T90 would be on top. If I had the T1 it would be the number one spot - but I only borrowed it from a friend for a few weeks. So don't own one (yet).

1. Audeze LCD-2 rev 1
Best overall balance and instrument separation. Great for music production too. Awesomely flat and deep bass.
 
2. Sennheiser HD600
Better mids than the Audezes and a very balanced freq. response - well suited for music production as well.
 
3. Denon D2000
Lots of fun with huge bass, that doesn't harm the overall tone. Quite bright too - these (and LCD-2s) are the phones to wow the non-headphiles.
 
4. Sennheiser HD650
These used to be nr.1, but LCD-2 did lots of things better. Now, that I'm not used to them, they do sound kinda dark.
 
5. Beyerdynamic DT770 80ohm
These were my 1st pair of serious phones. These are basically my choice for drum & guitar tracking now. Very durable design, comfy too. Sound quality is a step below the rest.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Alpha Dog - This thing has some serious control. That is the best word to describe the Alpha Dog. You get a very full sound with good depth of soundstage for a closed headphone with deep bass extension. The imaging is very spot on and musicality makes it less noticeable that the headphone is closed when comparing to the openness of say a DT880 or HD800. Instrument separation is also very good for a closed can. Sounds more like music is coming through a portal or wormhole directly to my ears than listening to dynamic drivers that generally lack this planar/electrostat realism on the mid-fi level.
 
2. DT880 - has a wider and airier soundstage than Alpha Dog, also the cups are round which lends itself to this quality. it just doesn't sound as full in the midrange or bass. Also there is more noticeable distortion on instrumentally busy tracks than my Alpha Dog. I would say the treble response of the DT880 is leaning more towards bright than neutral but with the right tubes it can be mellowed out a bit.
 
3. Bose QC25 (okay I use this one only for airplanes so it's sort of unfair)

An update to the list. Sorta flip around due to tube changes, etc. Rankings may change due to tube/system changes.
 
1.) AKG K712 Pro: These things finally sound right, some reason they are now the most natural sounding and easiest on my ears of all my headphones. Fantastic dynamics, soundstage, imaging, clarity, transparency, tonality, timbre, and speed. 
 
2.) Sennheiser HD 650: Laid-back and slightly dark sounding while retaining great resolution and simply gorgeous mids. Sounds a bit condensed compared to the AKGs. A bit more comfortable than the AKGs to me. 
 
3.) Beyerdynamic DT 150: Extremely well-balanced and has even better mids than the HD 650 with bass that reaches down low. Highs are neither bright or dark and the sound is more dynamic than the Senns. A bit more aggressive than the HD 650 but not what I consider an aggressive headphone, a bit more spacious sounding than the HD 650. Problems are some closed-back stuffiness and the somewhat odd fit.
 
4.) Sennheiser HD 600: Similar to the HD 650 but a bit leaner in the bass and slightly more airy and not quite as resolving. More natural tonality and timbre than the HD 650. Ranked 4th largely due to how similar it's tonality and timbre is to the K712 while not being as spacious and resolving as the K712.

2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (modded): "Audiophile bass cannon": capable of bigger bass than Beats with less distortion than the LCD-2, upper ranges do not suffer/aren't lacking, enormous soundstage, extremely comfortable
 
3: Toshiba HR-810 (modded): Ridiculous transients and control, very smooth, bass can hit hard despite being a stat/electret, a more "fun" tuning than the SS-100 but a bit closed-in sounding, gorgeous, not comfy
 
4: KOSS PortaPro: Good all rounders, nice and airy, very clean and clear, could use less bass distortion, not the most comfortable thing
 
to give a sense of scale relative to modern high-end gear, I'd rank the Sennheiser HD600 just barely above the PortaPro if I still had it due to comfort, less bass distortion, and soundstage

So natural and smooooooooth as silk. Try them and be suprised.
 
PS Not to be confused with the Woodtone in ear possibly the darkest sounding thing since the Goldring GX200. pretty dull really.
 
Edit. do have the seemingly ever popular PortaPros which would come in some way behind the Form2s

From best to worst:
 
1) Stax SR-007 MKII
2) Sennheiser HD800
3) Audeze LCD-2.2F
4) Hifiman HE-560
 
These are my top 4 favorite headphones. My issues with them are as follows:
 
1) Stax - stupid difficult to find amplification at a sane price.
2) Sennheiser - Lack of bass extension, "one-note" sounding compared to the electrostatic and planar headphones.
3) Audeze - Maybe a touch too dark, but it works with some genres. Way too uncomfortable (weight + headband bumps).
4) Hifiman - Sounded alright, but it was nothing special. Lacked the weighty sound that the other headphones were able to produce. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

ZMF Blackwood: I have a review up for them and even though I don't have a pair at the moment (waiting for an upgrade), I still feel like I'm missing something with everything else.
Modded Darth Beyer: I opened them up and there was nothing but cotton balls but after some damping, they can still rattle but don't sound half bad with anything with vocals anymore
OPPO PM2: They'd be fantastic headphones if I had nothing to compare them to, but since I do, they sound lacking a little bit in everything.
AKG K271: The second pair of headphones I've ever bought. With some J-Money pads they combine their very capable midrange and now have some nice bass.
Hifiman RE600: Fantastically warm, but after a while they're a bit tiring.
Master and Dynamic MH40: They're the best modern portable headphones I've used, which means next to nothing because I've hated most portable headphones. Their bass is kind of muddy, only made muddier with amplification for some reason. Their midrange is fine, but there's a random dip in the transition from the midrange to the treble that's similar to why I hated the M50. On the upside, they're easily the most durable headphones I have.
 
^NotaLefty, what do you think of the SR007's bass? My problem with the Stax I've tried (SR-009, Lambdas) was that while the bass was there, it didn't feel real. Rather, it felt diffuse rather than visceral like with dynamic headphones.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The SR-007 bass is in between the HD800 and LCD-2 in terms of presence, with slightly more than the HE-500. It is not as visceral or tight as the HD800, but there is a healthier amount of it and I prefer the presentation of the SR-007 overall. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Are you moving up from ZMF x Vibro? I haven't been able to compare the Mr. Speakers to the ZMF x Vibro/Blackwood but they should share some similarities even when after tuning is all said and done. I really enjoy the bass from the Alpha Dog though and I think it compares to my experiences I had with the LCD-XC and LCD-2F in overall satisfaction and presence of the bass

I have a comparison between the Alpha Dog, Vibro and a number of other closed cans in the ZMF thread, if you are interested.

I am very interested in checking that out 
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Whoops sorry I missed this! I had the Vibro and Blackwood side by side (I actually have a review comparing them!). I was never a fan of the Alpha Dog since it sounded rather artificial to me due to its cups and particular tuning. The ZMF headphones have much more accurate bass timbre and decay than the Alpha Dog. I actually like the Blackwood a great deal more than the XC.

1: Sansui SS-100 and Audez'e LCD-1: These two are tied for #1 place.  No, that's not a typo. The prototype of the LCD-2 with the super-duper 90's looking OEM chassis. They're about the same level overall, with the SS-100 being cleaner and more controlled sounding as well as more natural in frequency response, while the LCD-1 is slightly bright with a ridiculously tight, concise, fast sound. SS-100 has more detail and smoother mids. LCD-1 has a better soundstage and is much more comfortable.
 
2: Toshiba HR-810 (modified): Closed-in sounding compared to the two above, but other than that it has all of the merits of an electrostat along with bass that's comparable to planars and good dynamics. Not very comfortable. Extremely difficult to power.
 
3: Sony MDR-D77 Eggo: Extremely rare. These little things sound incredible. Easily just as fast and refined as all the above. Comfortable. Isolates well. Adorably tiny and foldable. Slightly thick/warm bass. Moderate "V" shaped FR curve. A bit less treble and these would be way higher.
 
4: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (mods in progress): ...these will never not be a bass cannon will they >____> I've done a lot of modifications to these and I've managed to vastly improve the soundstage and FR linearity, but what I can't seem to do is get the bass down to a reasonable level. I have a few more things I'm gonna do to them, including making new earpads, and if that doesn't work... well they're still an audiophile bass cannon. They are notably less refined than my other headphones as well.
 
5: KOSS PortaPro: Fallen out of use since the arrival of the Eggos. Best sub-$200 headphone ever if you can get past the enormous bass and awkward fit. Baby HD600 with syrup bass.
 
Nothing else sees use.

Tried velour ear pads?
Those are usually better at 'letting out the bass'.
 
From the VERY few drivers pics I could find of the Monitor 10, it looks like the driver has no rear-vents?
If it had vents, I would recommend over-damping them to kill the bass, but that doesn't seem possible.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Lots of neat and vintage interesting stuff there. I can't comment on any of it other than I'd say the porrta pro might be the best sub 100 dollar phone rather than best sub 200. Nice gear you have. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It does have a rear vent, but there's so little room in the earcups that there's no room for damping. Well, there is, but it's about 2mm of clearance, and I found adding damping put too much strain on the enclosure for not enough gain.
I'm making a pair of angled hybrid velour/pleather earpads for these as we speak. If those don't work, I'm gonna leave them as they are and try a transplant with the second pair I just nabbed off the 'bay. Thinking of a custom painted Nady QH560 shell to complement the LCD-1.

Good choices for future upgrades. Kind of sad that the HE-1000 costs more than eight times the HD650 new.

If you want to hear 'infinite air' replace the metal grills with speaker cloth (or similar).
It's like taking off the final chain holding it back and setting it free.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


As much as I like the HE-500, it demands attention due to it's energy. I like this for serious listening, but when reading stuff online or doing research, I need something warm and laid back to make sure I don't get all sucked into the energy of the music.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1- Beyer T1 - Fantastic with the right amp (tubes !) - disappointing with the wrong one
2- Philips fidelio X2: very easy to amp, full bodied sound
3- Beyer DT880 32 ohms: good with warm amp especially (need weight in the bass)
4- AKG K550: very well balanced but closed (generally suffer the comparison with open design in my opinion)
5- Noontec zoro: very easy to amp (16 ohms !) - powerful sound - bad fit
6- Sennheiser px100-II: impressive for the price  - nice bass
 .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }   
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I love my closed headphones, but I'm looking for my very first open ones. Can you tell me how much better the X2 is to the DT880 according to your tastes and how they compare to the K550? Those are my top two considerations right now.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


The DT880 slaughters the X2 in everything but... well, not having a massive annoying treble peak. The X2 is probably a better choice for someone just starting with open backs because it's not as offensive. It also doesn't require a gigavolt amplifier.
 
The AKG Q701 might be a good choice if you have the right amp. You need a bit more juice than the specs suggest to get it to 100%; try Asgard 2, Magni 2 Uber, maybe Vali. Avoid the Objective2 for this headphone.
 
Btw, never buy the 32 ohm variant if you do decide to get a Beyer; they're strictly worse sounding. 600 ohm is the best, but the 250 ohm is usually within 85-90% of performance of the 600 assuming both are properly amped and the 600 ohm is much more difficult to handle.

4. AD900x

5. K550 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I would say it depends on your amp...
X2 vs DT880, it's really a matter of preference - let's say the sound with the X2 is fuller, with significantly more bass and body - more soundstage depth also - the DT880 feels drier and less 3D
The X2 is very good with a neutral amp, a warm amp would fit the DT880 better
 
I would go with the X2 ;-) the transparency is very good, and to summarize you'll get more fun with it
 
Now to compare open and closed headphones...i feel that the sound with open design is more natural, it moves more easily, it's airier
From a pure sound quality point of view, I would choose open headphones without any hesitation - really better

I just ordered a pair of new old stock Grado RS1, so these will surely change the pecking order, we'll just have to wait and see. Meanwhile, this is how it looks.

Yes, I am a Grado fan, but i'm not a Grado fanboy, I'm the first one to admit that other companies make great headphones too. It's just that I know myself enough to know the if I had heaphones from other makes, I'd want the flagship models, and it would get very expensive, very fast, that's why I limit myself to one brand.

Alejandro here, 10 years happy with Senn 650s in music room. The chatter here encourages me to swap to new drivers and see what that does. Jazz primary ear diet. With LD1+ hybrid I get all the sound stage I need from good old Meridian 24 cd player. Very happy not to have 5 other pairs of ? When I just vant to be alone in public or out in the yard I can be quite happy with Koss UR55. These are stupid cheap as in under $25, need no amp so can ride with whatever player I choose. It's the music! Stan Getz to Steely Dan; Ella, Sarah, Mulligan, Monk, Miles, Mingus, and MJQ. Vad else do I need?

2) Monoprice 8323 Premium headphones = Rather uncomfortable and sound is just ok, but I have not played them more than 30 minutes since I got them. However, what does one want for $25?

yeah no the portapro can't outdo the SS-100
 
hell the HD600 can't outdo the SS-100
 
they all have somewhat similar tonal balances but the SS-100 is by far the most refined of the three; the HD600 sounds tizzy and harsh in comparison
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I've been away from here for a while an my collection has undergone a major revamp.  Let's give it a go from the top to the bottom.
 
Stax SR-Λ Normal Bias - A classic resurrected by extensive mods for comfort and sound.  Redamped on the back side.  Custom Ultrasuede and memory foam pads and a version of the Anax mod on the ear side to eliminate every last trace of Stax treble 'etch'.  A custom Ultrasuede and memory foam headband for even further comfort.
 
Stax SR-202 - Lightly modded with Ultrasuede and memory foam earpads and reversing the cloth cover over the earside grill so that the plasticky edge trime piece reflects back towards the driver.  At the moment these have slightly more edge to their treble than my SR-Λ Normal Bias even though they're actually darker.  Still puts most all dynamics and planars I've heard to shame in that respect though.  I haven't exhausted my bag of modding tricks on this one yet either.
 
Phonak Audeo PFE 232 - V shaped FR is great for quiet listening.  Great imaging and soundstage for an IEM.
 
Shure SE530 - Super smooth and liquid mids.  Listen all day and never get fatigued.
 
Bose QC15 - I think these are somewhat close on the heels of closed flagships like the TH900.  The overall tonality is great, but marred by several small peaks in the treble and the THD+N is a bit high.  OTOH the soundstage is amazing for closed headphone, especially a small closed headphone like this one.  Of course there's the ANC which is just the best there is.
 
For *practical* use these are #1 though.  As a headset for work or for listening to audiobooks and podcasts while I'm doing other stuff around the house I probably wear these 10-12 hours a day.  If I could only have one pair of headphone it would probably these.  They aren't the best, or even second best, at anything, but they're by far the most practical and do a passable job of everything.
 
AKG K601 - These make a good reference FR as they're very nearly a diffuse field equalization.  Unfortunately they're marred by excessive distortion and driver ringing that prevent me from listening to them for very long.
 
Sony XB700 - Can't get rid of them since it's too much fun to pull these out and crank the bass on occasion.  A simple mod with hair elastics over the edge of cups to keep the ginormous pads from collapsing keeps the drivers far away from you ears and give a big boost to the sound stage.
 
Koss KSC-75 - Perhaps the ultimate budget-fi headphone, going back and forth between it and anything else I own really drives home the idea of diminishing returns.  I have a couple of these and the get used when I'm doing something strenuous and don't want to sweat all over anything more expensive.
 
Fostex T50RP - These will remain on the bottom until such time as I get around to reassembling them...

Damn, HD600 harsh and tizzy? First I'm hearing of it
Sounds more like a downstream issue to me
I just can't do vintage headphones as they are always so compressed in soundstage from what I recall, maybe in the future I might revisit them

because yes, it can't just be that the other headphone is better, it absolutely has to be that I didn't use the right source equipment. sure. okay.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Reread what I said mate
Never questioned whether your Sansui or whatever was better, just questioning why you are hearing the HD600 as tizzy and harsh when I've never read that from a experienced audiophile. Sure somebody coming from bass-heavy, wooly sets of headphones straight to a neutral sig. might view the HD600 as harsh but somebody who has adjusted to neutrality... nope not buying it.
Guessing this is just another case of ****ting on a headphone because it's popular and well-regarded or a cry for people to hop on vintage headphones
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I explicitly said that I heard it that way in comparison, not that it was that way on its own, sorry for the confusion but it seems you didn't read what I said either
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



The HD650 was supposed to round off the harsh edges of the 600 and sound more refined and musical overall with capability of producing higher amounts of resolution. I urge you to give it a try  
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


That's too modern for Takato *trololol* 
Maybe try suggesting the HD540 instead  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


actually I do want to try the HD650
 
the 540 doesnt interest me much, the 560 measures like a significantly brighter HD600 and I doubt lower models would be much different, but idk maybe
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Owning both the HD 650 and HD 600, I definitely find this the case. I like the HD 650 a good amount more than the HD 600. It is definitely smoother, higher resolution, and has better clarity to my ears.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yeah, honestly I wouldn't recommend the HD540 to anyone unless they had access to a bunch of pads to roll with them. 
Stock pads give a really incredible soundstage, but they're no fun since they totally lack bass impact. They sound quite good and balanced with hifiman pleathers though.
 
I've auditioned both HD600 and HD650; the 650 was my preferred headphone which made the 600 sound a touch lacklustre and less engaging. Not saying the 600 is bad, better have a 600 than nothing!
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I really must try a 600 or 650 at some point.

x 2! I've owned quite the array of headphones over the years and I always come back to the HD600. They hit all the right buttons for me even compared to headphones many times their price.

I own a good number of cans, but have NEVER tried a HD600 or HD650, really ought to try them but am afraid I'd like 'em. My plate is quite full now, though I'm still working on snagging a couple of closed cans.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Sansui with on ears or full pad setup?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


right now its a circumaural earpad sandwich with the stock ones and a pair of Monitor 10-II pads on top of them and a 60mm foam ring insert around the driver
 
enormous soundstage and very very clean/detailed
 
oh, and the small supra aural pads were removed
 
...wait, are you talking about the SS-100 or the SS-35

was wondering if you removed the modular outer pad sections and used the on ears option only, but question answered.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I would definitely give them a shot when you can. I've owned probably close to 15-20 different pairs of headphones over the years with the Sennheiser's being one of the cheaper sets - yet they always seem to satisfy me the most. After getting over 'new toy syndrome' with new acquisitions, the HD600 have always remained - tried, trusted and always satisfying. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Ugh, as I'd said, my plate's kinda full right now, I should be getting a Shure 1540 and a Denon AH-D7k (and perhaps a Markl modded D5k) early next month......don't think I'd be getting any more cans as my soon to be acquired cans are closed back, noticed I'm a little light on closed back cans.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Haha, indeed. You have quite the stable already there I see. The Denon D7K are a nice can which I hope you enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed them for the time I had them and they are an absolute beauty in person.

haven't updated my rankings for some time now... 
 
 
AKG K553 PRO >= Sony MDR 7506
 
short comparison:
* The 7506 has more bass (slightly elevated), but it is much harder to drive them to volumes (less sensitive and resisting more...)
   also, some classical instruments sounds a touch too cold (e.g the piano)... other than that, it is an excellent all-rounder headphone.
* The 553 is a bigger sized headphone. it is really detailed (it somehow manages to push more details out), also - it's exhibiting a wide stage
   and it has a really natural bass curve (flat!). it's pads are warming pretty quick though. The piano sounds spot on :)
-  comfort is about equal (both has some little disadvantages),  
 
Etymotic Research ER4P (using the s version -detailed to the extreme, too much microphonics for serious "on the go" use, sometimes can be too harsh. small stage)
 
Etymotic Research MK5 (light, comfortable, excellent isolation, average stage for IEMs, bass is elevated but not much, treble/extensive detailing -not much, cable is a good one...
                                    - the best all-rounder IEM i ever heard!)
 
Sony MDR MA 100 (small, lightweight, can sometimes get uncomfortable for easily driven, little bassy at times)
Panasonic RP-HT21 (small, comfortable, too bassy at times)

I don't see a lot of PS1000 lovers anymore, though I've always preferred the model to the HD800 and T1. If I still had my pair, it would probably rank above my ESP950 on pure SQ and between the ESP950 and HD650 for musical enjoyment.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

OK, here I go again since I've acquired the D7k recently, it's definitely one of my fave cans so I'll have to revise my list:
 
01. Sennheiser HD800 (the soundstage!)
01. Denon AH-D7000 (great overall can, more refined/less harshness on treble and more neutral bass compared to the D2000)
02. Grado GS1000i (very nice treble sparkle, awesome vocals, so smooth, best among my cans)
02. AKG K812 (more intimate but as detailed as the HD800.....to my ears anyway)
03. Audeze LCD2 (dark with great bass, good mids and pretty decent HF that's not harsh)
03. HiFiMan HE500 (great mids and highs, decent enough bass, very 'musical')
04. Sennheiser HD700 
05. HiFiMan HE400i (just got it, but liking what I hear)
05. Audio Technica ATH-AD2000 (very detailed sounding, highs is a tad harsh, but vocals is lovely)
05. Denon AH-D2000 (detailed sounding, good soundstage for close back, good bass with tad harsh highs)
06. Beyerdynamic DT990/600 (clear highs, nice bass boost)
07. Philips Fidelio X1
07. MrSpeakers Alpha Dog (somewhat less detailed sounding to me, but very creamy sound, great for simply chilling)
08. Sennheiser HD555 (foam mod, open sounding, decent mids and highs, lacks bass)
08. Audio Technica ATH-AD700X (similar to above)
09. Fostex T50RP (stock, sounds congested, bass light, smooth vocals)

Thank you Sir, I haven't heard the Koss yet. Used to have an old pair of Stax Lambda that I greatly enjoyed. The HE560 and PS1000s compliment each other well, I will have to keep an eye on the ESP950s to get a trifecta of great sounding technologies 😉.

Congratulations and welcome to the forum communities!
 
Hmmm....  I may have to check out these PHONAK 232 iems you regard so highly.  Respect your Sony choices.  I am actually considering some XBA-A2 imports myself.  And of course the HD-650s are at the top of my personal list.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Thank you for the warm welcome :)
 
My rank is purely subjective, and probably my list will give you an impression that I tend to lean on bright-sounding headphones, the reason why Sennheiser HD650 is #6. Still, HD650 is still one of my favorites since it is comfy and non-fatiguing (SQ-wise), unlike the Hifiman HE500 (heavier in terms of weight and not as comfy). And the HD650 is a perfect combo with ifI Micro IDSD :)
 
The Phonak 232 is an old BA iem which is already phased-out, and you might not be able to find or buy it anymore. I bought it second hand from an audiophile shop owner 3 years ago.

Your opinion about the Senn IE800- I strongly agree. This is an underrated IEM with magical capabilities, and it even beats out slightly my full size can Hifiman HE-500. Before my audition and eventual purchase of this great IEM, some of my enthusiast and audiophile friends dissuaded and told me that it is the worst-sounding high-tier universal IEM due to its brightness and inaccurate bass. The thing here is that these attributes disappeared after lengthy listening/ auditioning plus choosing the best eartips (small oblong), wearing it full insertion into the ear canal. An example of its musical capability: the guitar licks of certain jazz and rock songs heard on this wonderful IEM will make you feel it and "tickle your ears" because of its accuracy, unlike certain similarly-priced universal BA IEMs I have auditioned.

I would place the HD600 above my JH13PRO too. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

The rankings also really depend on how each headphone is driven/paired. The HD600/650 can sound like junk or angels singing in your ear depending on the musical chain as I found out last weekend at a local mini-meet. Same goes with the CIEMs. I have always liked the HD800 better than my NT6pro CIEM until I compared the two on the new Schiit Ygg/Rag stack. The NT6pro gained all the HD800 sound stage and detail attributes plus killed it with perfect, impactful, organic bass that the HD800 has a hard time serving.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I too was blown away by how good CIEMs scale! In my case Alclair RSMs, incredible soundstage, clarity, detail, really awesome. It gives me a choice of reference sound whether I am on the go or listening at home.

When I first heard Westone 3, i thought they were amazing, I was blown away. At the time I was listening to my SRH1440's extensively. Then I got the IE800's, and that was it. I said this is the eargazm nirvana. I listen to some FLAC files, and I literally hear sounds from instruments that I can not hear with other headphones in my staple. It is one of those things, you listen to a song, and you just out of a sudden hear this timbre of the cymbal and you have a wtf moment. And you question yourself, and say I listened to this song maybe 100 times, and I just heard this on my right hear, from the depths of the sound? Then you test the same song same sound with other headphones, and you realize only IE800 produces that sound with its full clarity, other headphones just have it lost in the rest of the instruments, and then you realize, wow, this is just what it is. This is the top until you spend 2-3 times more money on what you spend on IE800 to get the same or a tad better performance.
 
At work, I use the ie800, can not put it aside at all. I am addicted to it. It does every genre I listen to, everything in perfection.

Same way HPs can't touch speakers, speakers can't touch live music.
I've been wondering why HPs can't be 2 or 3-way, like speakers and IEMs... 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


most probably placement of drivers would be the first problem with this.
 
there are 2 way headphones, jvc if i recall?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


There have been LOADS of multi-channel and quadraphonic headphones from many brands, AKG, Sansui, Technics, Koss, Elega, Hitachi, Heru, Marants, Pioneer, Sennheiser, Toshiba, Universum etc
More recently gaming headsets have been implementing 5.1 and pseudo 7.1 headsets.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I would rather not... hd800 still beats all of them in all departments, or at least from what i tested... so... maybe more than one driver in a headphone does not make sense if you do not include a very good crossover? or maybe it is simpler to do everything using only one driver?... i will study further.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Oh yeah, totally don't bother with any of these if you're actually interested in sound quality.
Especially the gaming headsets which are almost nauseating to listen to.
 
The AKG K280 Parabolic was the best sounding quad I've heard, but had a very weird spacial presentation. Not natural at all. 
 
I would still like to try out the Panasonic RP-HD10 and the JVC HA-SZ2000 at some point, but these 2 way headphones are designed for extreme FR handling rather than spacial presentation.

Honestly most IEMs are better than most full size headphones pretty much everywhere except outside you head projection of soundstage.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Well that's a massive insurmountable difference and why they or any iem cant hope to compete.
 
As I said I've found the very best earbuds (non in ear) can give that out of the head experience but even they only compete with the lower end of the fullsize/on ear spectrum in my experience. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Where can I find them? AKG and Sennheiser? What model? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Why the RP-HD10? Pretty iridescent diaphragm aside, it's not a 2-way like the JVCs are.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Try a Sony MDR-e282. Brilliant sounding. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


JVC ha-sz 2000 was the only which interested me with more than one drive, but i understood that the actual sound was no where near what one would expect out of them... 
 
Unless i try them, i cannot really speak...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


 
Being inferior in a single area isn't exactly an "massive insurmountable difference" unless that one area happens to be your favorite...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Well you made a silly statement so thought I'd reply with one !
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Well you are correct, because headphones can't compete with speakers when it comes to natural sound and realism, and if you take away the little bit of soundstage they do have, you cripple them complety!
What I'm saying is headphones need all the help they can get to sound more open and closer to the sound of speakers.

Yes I'l like to 
 
I am a fan of earbuds (have had MX980s currently have Airjax & old MX760s among others) but thet still have physical limitations unless you think the E282 is better than your SS100s in which case they are certainly something else.
 
In terms of sound stage and airiness however they get a lot closer and even surpass full size phones compared to iems which don't come close (yes even my amazing EB50s !)  Ther/es also the indefinable sense of scale which you get with a bigger headphone, the amount of air they move ?!?  An iem just cant do it I think. All in my limited experience of things I've owned, of course, not speculation.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Actually the Auclair RSM Quad CIEMs provide a very vice soundstage. Not high end in price, but definitely in performance. What CIEMs have you heard?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I have heard no 'ciems' and probably never will.
 
(By the way I'm probably (almost definately) stupid but what I don't understand is that a custom iem (they seem to be just lumped together as a higher class of listening experience) is automatically better than anything else just due to its custom fit. Surely the quality of transducer stands for something. However I'm sure the best ones equal the best full size headphone in most areas)
 
As I said, based on my(limited) experience, and only based on soundstage, iems (and therefore probably 'ciems') are not better than full size. I don't think that's too controversial surely and must be shared by one or two other people on Headfi who still like to use those old fashioned full size (or portable for that matter) headphones. I am no expert just an opinion based on what Ive had, just as it was the opinion of the person who said most IEMs are better than most full size headphones. Surely that's a more debatable statement. Even they conceded that headphones have a better soundstage !. I'm a bit of fan of a nice soundstage myself. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Try the Dunu Titans, they are inexpensive (relatively) IEMs that do have a great soundstage. I actually shared your opinion about in-ears, wasn't happy with anything I had experienced. 
 
There are times when I prefer the Alclair, generally traveling or on the go, but love my Grados for easy to drive goodness, and HE560s for the planar dynamic take on music delivery. 
 
CIEMs seal better, so you get a superior presentation, taking very good transducers from Auclair, 1963 Ears, JH Audio, Noble, making them even better.
 
I am also a big fan of soundstage, that's why I really don't care for the entry some of the Grado Line, but love the GS and PS Series. I wasn't expecting to ever find an iem that I liked, kept trying them because they are far easier than over ear closed cans for travel, working out, etc. Finally was convinced to try the Titans, Zero Audio Duozas (another very good inexpensive em), then the Alclairs, then sold my Alpha Dogs.
 
I wasn't judging at all, we all are learning here. Cheers

1.TTPOD T1. Good balance. Prefer it for jazz because of its soundstage but it's my first choice as an all rounder for use with my iBasso DX50.
2. Narmoo S1. Bass is perfect though treble can be a bit much with some genres.
3. CoreCool V2. I like the build and detachable cables but the bass is bloated and treble is rolled off too much. Doesn't sound right with tips that decrease bass. It does sound better with the Fiio X1 than the DX50 though.
4. Brainwavz R3. Very wide soundstage but lacks the bass that the TTPOD T1 has.Edited by dwayniac - 5/17/15 at 4:02pm

Well. The new amp/DAC combo I purchased really stirred things up a bit. (Gustard H10 + Geek Out 450 for anyone curious)
 
1: Sansui SS-100: Still as good as it always was, but that last little bit of smearing and cloudiness/lack of coherency to the sound is simply gone. My absolute best and favorite headphone in everything but comfort. Have to set the gain to +6dB on the Gustard for these.
 
2: Pioneer SE-500 (modified): Gotta say, I'm really surprised with this decrepit old thing. It's the second headphone I ever bought on my own, and it's been through countless repairs and hasn't seen much consistent use in the past couple years. Turns out all it needed was a ludicrous amount of power. It sounds similar to the SS-100 in presentation and timbre: fast, low distortion, deep and coherent if a little 2-dimensional, very clean, and very seductive. There are times when using these that I feel like it actually has more tactility to it than the Sansuis; instruments are easier to pick out and place. It is however, considerably brighter than the SS-100, by virtue of both lack of bass/bass weight and fleshier upper midrange/treble. I find that it sees about the same amount of head time as the SS-100. Still, the lack of ability to hit that last low octave is a critical flaw and makes them difficult to listen to with some tracks. These prefer -6dB gain on the amp, though they gain bass as you feed them current (lower gain; unfortunately the Gustard can't get them loud enough on any setting below -6)
 
Too tired to type out the others... the only ones worth mentioning are incomplete modding projects anyways.

High def listening:  (DSD, FLAC, DXD, Other lossless)
Sennheiser HD-650  (These are my "slow, lose yourself in excellently-recorded music" headphones  Classical, most Jazz, World music, Orchestral, etc... nothing comes close other than the RS-180s, which are a fairly-distant second.  Thus they dominate this category, but don't really have a spot in the other categories.)
AKG K550 (Higher definition than the HD-650s, and more evenly-balanced.  While great soundstage for closed backs, the HD-650s win in terms of 2D/3D space, instrument separation, and "fullness" of sound.)
AKG K545  (Very similar to the K550s, but smaller, better defined bass, but NOT bass-heavy.)
Koss Porta-Pros (Best bang-for-the-buck all-rounders.  No weaknesses in any genre, and my iPhone compatible version allows remote control, and ability to take phone calls if needed.)
JVC HA-SZ2000  (The ONLY fault I have with these phones is their "stock" sound.  The stock earpads are HORRIBLE.  Immediately swap them for Brainwavz HM5 pads for uber-comfort, or JVC M55x pads for good comfort, but uber-bass kinetic transfer.  Unamped, these are decent high-resolving headphones, but mids are recessed needing fairly heavy EQ to make natural.  Amped, the same applies but now these take on  whole new life as BASSHEAD Kings.  While many have challenged, none have shown proof of superior cans by anyone at ANY price either here at Head-Fi or Youtube WHEN THESE ARE PROPERLY AMPED by an iDSD Micro, FIIO e12, or Cayin C5 (current "king" of portable amps for bassheads.)  These take audio settings that make even JVC HA-M55x phones crackle and buzz.  I venture that most of my other phones would suffer either immediate or long-term damage if I tried them at these settings!)
Photive PH-BTX6 (Wired) (Near and dear to my heart as my first-ever GOOD pair of bluetooth headphones, and for less than $50, they aren't traumatic to lose or replace like BOSE or BEATS would be.
VMODA BASS-FREQS  (Discontinued, but you can still find them around.  Hands-down the most durable iems I have ever owned, and they just sound "fun" though not at all "accurate", othwise they would be much higher rated!
Photive PH-BTX6 (Bluetooth) Powered mode brings even more low-end which is great for house/club/Techno/etc.., but slightly reduces clarity for critical listening while eeking-out a more "Full" sound and slightly wider soundstage.
 
 
"FUN" listening:  (MP3, miscellaneous)
Koss Porta-Pros
AKG K545
VMODA BASS-FREQS
Photive PH-BTX6 (Bluetooth)
AKG K550
Photive PH-BTX6 (Wired)
 
 
BASSHEAD: (Any worthy track in any format)
JVC HA-SZ2000  (Nothing I've heard touches it when amped!)
JVC HA-M55x (2nd best amped, 1st place straight from iPhone/iPad/MP3 players with "standard consumer-grade amplification")
Photive PH-BTX6 (Amped or not, Wired or bluetooth.  Would rate higher but while LOT of bass, it errs a bit on the loose & sloppy side compared to the top JVCs above.  Before owning them, I happily called these my favorite basshead headphones, so not bad at all, and for less than $50 for GOOD bluetooth headphones is nothing to sneer at.)
VMODA BASS-FREQS (My favorite in-ears hands down for ANY application.)
Koss Porta-Pros (Get honorable mention because while they CAN "thump" surprisingly well, I use them while mobile, and they don't isolate well like the AKGs do, so I seldom get to BASSHEAD levels with them out of courtesy to others.)
 
 
TRAVEL:
AKG K545 (Best balance of portability, Sound isolation internal and external, iPhone audio/call functionailty, REFERENCE-CLASS sound quality, and equally capable in all genres EXCEPT BASSHEAD.)
VMODA BASS-FREQS (Simple, small, good sound, tons of "fun factor".)
Koss Porta-Pros (Great sound, inexpensive if lost/broken, easy to fit in even the smallest laptop bag.)
Photive PH-BTX6 (Bluetooth sound great, good sound quality over-all, but bass is a bit bloated and obscures the mids.  For the most part, it's correctable, but as I generally use them as portable BASSHEAD cans, I never bother  to EQ for that shortcoming anymore.)
While the HA-SZ2000, K550, &HA-M55x would all sound great for travel, they are all RIDICULOUSLY LARGE for wearing in public.  Maybe it wouldn't bother others, but I never cared much for the "Princess Leia look" on guys personally....
 
EDIT
 
I almost forgot movie viewing!  Sennheiser RS-180s are my favorites hands-down.  They aren't bad for music either, but the HD-650s just out-do them in every area, so I seldom do use the RS-180s for anything other than movies/TV.  Fair warning though, they are open back so others in the room can hear what you are watching.

Not white like mine, but Red ones fit the gym theme nicely!  (Better than orange, anyway.)  $49 bucks is still a steal if they are anywhere near the quality of mine.  (I think mine were only $29 when I bought mine many years ago.) A decade later, and my set still look mostly like new.  (Just a smudge, here and there, but hey, THEY'RE WHITE.  Anything white and used almost daily for years will show a smudge or two.)
Oh, and did I forget to mention that they are LOUD?!?!?  I use them out of my iPhones or iPads without an amp, and they never sound too soft, OR flat as many  headphones can sound straight out of iPhones/iPads.  They don't thump as hard as they are capable of, but they don't sound as bass-anemic as the iPhones can sound normally, and that to me is a good thing.

Temporary ranking while my other schiit is away.
 
1: Pioneer SE-500: By far the best thing I have right now. Absurd clarity and soundstage depth, extremely good detail retrieval. Just too shallow down low and not comfortable enough to wear constantly.
 
2: Sony MDR-605 (mods): Baby MDR-F1. Very realistic soundstage, clean and clear, but can't be played loudly without causing awful grating upper mids.
 
3: Sansui SS-35 (Extreme modifications): New 50mm silk/wool composite drivers. Big pleather earpads from a Sony DR-9.  Much nicer than stock. Bass isn't as thick as stock drivers. Treble is much smoother and more detailed.
 
4: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (mods): Audiophile bass cannon until I finish the new pads for them. The soundstage is too smashed and the bass is too monstrous with these thin earpads.
 
5: Speakers: Power Woofer OG-5050. Sub + two midrange satellites with piezo horn tweeters. Good FR, crisp treble, but there's a huge veil that goes away when I change to headphones. Not any specific headphone either, just anything but these. Even running off the same DAC they sound lo-fi by comparison to anything above.

Because they look totally ridiculous when worn. 
They stick out SO far out the side of your head... I feel more confident wearing some 70's/80's vintage headphones outdoors

The MSR7 seems like somewhat of an outcast near the top of your rankings, unless you just don't like the sound signature of the HD650. What makes you drawn to them so much?

These are all really close. I have not had enough time (or gear) with the HD 800 for it displace the HD 650. HE-500s come close to the HD 650 and surpass it several recordings (mostly electronic), but the HD 650 remains the most versatile for me (it does electronic and everything else so well). K7XX is pretty amazing too, but they do not beat out the others on the list.

Now, listening through Accuphase gear.

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Why do you like t1 more than HD800?

 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


I compare the sound delivered against real sound.  T1 is closer to the sound I listen when, for instance,  go to the Hall to listen to a full orchestra.  HD800 is an excellent headphone when you need to analize how the recording was made... is extremely detailed, but in my opinion and listening  in doing so departs from natural sound.  Again, T1  sounds closer to my speakers (Tannoy Kingdom) driven by Accuphase than HD800.  T1 is great in bass, and it is detailed too, maybe not as much as HD800.
 
When I want  to enjoy a private listening at night I can live perfectly well using T1 or HD800, thou T1 delivers closer to the speakers (signature) in my opinion.  All headphones at this level have excellent sound quality.  But sometimes the use of one or another depends on the source and kind of music.  For instance, sometimes I even prefer the HD700 or HD650, specially when the recording is not so perfect.  As a final result (enjoyment) could be better than listening with T1 or HD800  .  T1 and specially HD800 shows that scandalously.  This is something that headphones allows you:  to change drivers when you need.  Doing it with loudspeakers could be very… very expensive.  Now I bought a headphone amplifier (all tube): WooAudio WA2.  Waiting for delivery. Comments say it softens HD800 towards a more natural sound.  We’ll see.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


he also put the HD700 above the Q701, so he probably likes a bit of treble ringing
 
plus the HD800 can sound pretty unpleasant with the wrong gear/song/without mods
 
or who knows, maybe Beyer's QC worked in his favor and he got a "God Tier" pair

Interesting comments, indeed.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I'm also somebody who prefers the T1 to the HD800, at least when it comes to actual musical enjoyment. I owned a PS1000 and T1 at the same time, and between the two I was covered for pretty much anything I wanted to listen to with a headphone that made any particular genre more pleasant than the HD800 did.

I should listen to my other gear more often.
 
1: Sansui SS-100: Smooth as butter. Lacks a large low end; needs new pads. Fantastic soundstage and clarity. Treble is perfect. Doesn't like being driven loudly. Uncomfortable as sin.
 
2: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (extensive modifications): Barely below the Sansuis. More bass. Equal clarity. More 3D in presentation while being smaller in overall soundstage; hard to describe the exact differences, more of a preference thing. "Harder" sounding treble (distortion? ear-side ringing caused by earpads? dunno.) Upper midrange hole. 1kHz peak. Isolates like crazy. Much more comfortable. 
 
3: Etymotic ER-4S: Sending this one back, but not because of sound. Love how these sound. Just a bit too dark compared to the Sansui. No, I'm sending these back because I am physically incapable of wearing them. Several painful zits formed in both ears after about a week of use at work. Guess I'm really not an IEM guy.
 
4: Pioneer SE-500 (modified): eeehh. Very little bass and lower mids, and no warmth at all. Smooth and clear as hell but that's still not a good combination, and it can sound fatiguing because of this. Maybe the right pads would work.
 
5: Beyer DT48 S 5 ohm: These are something I like, that I really shouldn't. Literally no bass at all and less treble/upper mids than the SE-500 above, but there's something "special" about the presentation... they are definitely unique and do see use occasionally.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


OK. NEVERMIND.
 
1: Sansui SS-100 (modded): Holy crap. I added a pair of rockwool discs from a Bang & Olufsen U70 to the rear of the drivers and placed the stock damping on top of that. Then I layered a pair of Shure SRH-550DJ pads with the inner foam cut out over the stock pads.
 
Then I voided my bowels. 
 
Unbelievable. Now they have bass and a pair of peaks in the upper ranges (2.5kHz and 8kHz) almost completely vanished. Presentation is larger and more 3D. These sound incredible, oh my god.

(While I wait for the headband repair on my
DT880 Premium, I pulled the Pro's out of

with delight.  What great headphones!  They
need an amp, of course, but the sound (and
comfort) are terrific)  And while I can't listen
back and forth to the two headphones, from
memory there's no difference between them
to my ears.

Opinions are all over on these.  I hear their
weaknesses but still like them a lot.  Every
time I try a different closed headphone, the Z7's
come out on top.
 
 
Sennheiser HD 25 1 ii - original steel wiring

Outstanding closed headphones.  The re-wiring
makes a huge difference; I'm not sure I'd have
believed it if I hadn't heard it.

I like 'em a lot for closed headphones, but not as much

Takato's rankings change fairly often, and there aren't any rules about posting more than a couple times a month in this thread. Honestly, there are dozens of posts between each of takato's, and there's nothing wrong with sharing updates. There's a big difference between posting to a thread often and spamming, and takato is not spamming. If it annoys you, you can easily skip each post in question. If this were a higher-traffic thread, like "What are you listening to right now?" or the HD650 impressions thread, you likely wouldn't even notice the frequency.

How do you figure?  I only post when something changes, and I change my descriptions every time. I also very rarely post in this thread. 
 
As others pointed out, you are not forced to read my posts. I will post what I want, when I want, so long as it's relevant and within the forum rules. Deal with it or block me. It's your choice. 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I would suggest not to worry about this.  In my experience with other forums there is always somebody which is in a different frequency.  Do repect this people and just ignore them.  When posting at Apple forum there were three guys just posting messages and disturbing some members, because they wanted to increase the number of posts.  The best solution was not to quarrel.  Even here (and I am a new member) I received some not very polite comments on my opinion.  Let them go.

Nothing's really changed...I still really enjoy my PS1000e's...actually listening to them right now, but I've always preferred the HD800s.  Oh, and there's a new #2...the HE1000s.

Perhaps a bit short compared to some others so nothing special but here I go:
 
1. HD650: needs no explanation
2. NAD Viso HP50: great closed back for less than $300 though bad ergonomics
3. Mr. Speakers Mad Dog: another great option for less than $300, most will like this over the HP50 but my preferences are more HP50
4. HD598: not really being used since I got my HD650's but still, not bad
5. Martin Logan Mikros 90: I don't know why Martin Logan stopped headphone production a few months ago, apparently they weren't selling enough but good on-ears for the price regardless
6. SR80E modded by me: meh. I don't care about these anymore. It's probably a good idea to sell these soon to those who appreciate Grados
7. Bunch of in-ears like Xiaomi Piston 3s, some Senns but nothing worth mentioning

Gotta separate my IEM's from the others but here's my (top 4) ranking:
 
Full Size:
 
1) Beyer T1 - great allrounder, deep soundstage - Bright Yin
2) HE-500 - just a hair behind the T1 and loved just as much - Warm Yang
3) Fidelio X2 - very musical, so versatile, and relatively easy to drive
4) HD650 - Still magical with acoustic music and intimate vocals
 
 
IEM:
 
1) RE-600 Songbird - does everything right (unless you're a basshead) - questionable durability is my only con
2) Sony MDR-7550 - like the HE-500/HD650 tonality and want an IEM?  This is the one.
3) Vsonic GR07 - just an amazing all rounder and the best thing under $100
4) Audio-Technica CKR9 - love the BA like speed with dynamic driver bass texture
 
My other headphones have limited/specific purposes or were bought out of curiousity and as such I can't adequately rank them overall.

No idea. By "I'm looking at adding HE560s to the list at the moment" I meant I'm considering buying them.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

On head:  I recommend and external amplifer for all of these 'phones.  I am using various Schiit amps e.g., Fulla, Magni, Asgard.  Also recommend the OPPO HA-2, which is a steal.  Have an old school Antique Labs MT in OTL mode which is very tube sensitive and noisy like cooking bacon.
Grado RA-1 is only good for any Sennheiser, not so good with anything else I own.
 
1. Oppo PM 2:  Great response.  Seems linear.
2. Sennheiser 650:  Little dark so great on very bright or bass shy stuff.  Most comfortable of any headphone I have ever owned.
3. Harman Kardon NC wired.  Out of print.  Bought for noise cancelling, but actual prefer it without noise cancelling.  Great for traveling.  Not the most comfortable unit.  HK was clearing them out for a very low price last year.
4. Audio-Technica ATH-M50x:  Quite comfortable, good closed back.  Nice "budget headphone".  I found best for computer gaming and rock and jazz.  Not for classical music.
5. Sennheiser 580: Liked until cheaper 'phones were better so I moved to 650
6. Sennheiser 280:  Bright, good substitute for noise cancelling
 
IE 'phones:  
1. Shure SE 535:  Wow!  Can hear details I have never heard before in a lot of music.  Comfortable too.
2. Kenwood HA-FX850:  cdjapan.co.jp offered these at a steal.  KInd of dark but the most comfortable IE I own.  Sound is not as good as the Shure 425, but the Kenwood is much more comfortable.
3. Shure SE 425:  Great IE, until I listened through the 535.  Is the 535 $250 better than the 425?  Probably not, but the difference is apparent.
 
I own a series of Sony, Koss, and IE pos but as you spend more, you get more.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



What about the TH900 you prefer over the HD800, besides bass? 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It's more fun and involving with the music I like, which is mostly electronic.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I don't own many. Gotten rid of some the last few years too.
Full-Sized:
1. JVC HA-RX700 - I use these mainly at home. The long wire and large size make them unweildingly clumsy for on-the-go. They have a nice laid back signature and are quite comfortable with minimal clamp.
2. Sony MDR-XB950AP/H - I plan on using these for trips and maybe some commuting. They have some nice bass (prefer analytical) but sound veiled and recessed compared to everything else I have. Very comfortable and soft earpads. Look nice with a brushed aluminum exterior. Bass seems to drop off nicely depending on the music you listen to. It was hard for me ranking this higher due to the veiled sound.
3. Monoprice 8323 - I still have the stock cables but just replaced the pads with the polyurethane ones. Much more comfortable and due to extensive OTG use mines has limited clamp. Still sounds odd to my ears. Feel like it needs more bass, a better soundstage, etc. Maybe others are right and these need new housings.
4. Coby CV-150? - I forgot the exact model for these. The cable broke halfway between the plug and the y-split. Dad helped me replace it with a jury rigged alternative. Thinking about tossing them. Okay sounding, uncomfortable vinyl pads, and next to no swivel on the cups. All of this plus my big ears make these the worst OTG phones.
Portable:
1. Photive PH-BT3 - My first pair of BT phones. Not bad. Fairly neutral, some bass (nothing exciting), lasts 12-14 hours on a full charge with max volume. Convienent without the hassle of wires.
2. Panasonic SHP-9500? - Don't recall the exact model off hand. It folds inward with a twist. Cups are small and they pinch my ears. Surprising good sounding (as joker already said in the shootout thread). Cable came out from the right ear. Reliefs are apparently useless. Tried supergluing back in. Gave them away to my mom. Cable came back out a few months later.
In-Ears:
1. Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 3 - My very first pair of IEMs. Awesome. Clear, analytical, made me happy for years. I eventually grew frustrated with the semi-memory wire. Tangled like crazy and the single flange tips no longer seal as well. Replacement double-flange tips weren't as thick and so I ended up back with the stock tips.
2. Soundmagic E10 - nice dynamics. I feel they are like a funner version of the UEs I have. Clear, decent bass, leans on the analytical side. Over great and comes with double-flange tips.
3. Meelectronics M9 - slightly veiled compared to e10s. Tips tend to bend in my ears. Way too flexible. After markets tips are just as bad (at least the ones I have).
4. Soundmagic PL-18 - pretty standard. Bass is a bit better then the E10s but lack some of the detail. Let brother borrow once and he lost them. 
I want to get a nice pair of Senns in the future. Not sure which yet.

This post helps me a lot as I'm deciding which one to purchase next. How would you describe vocals, specifically female vocals, in regards to both cans? I listen to mostly electronic music and I've found the HE-500 more enjoyable than the 560 and the LCD2.

New IEM rankings.
1.Yamaha EPH-100. Dethroned the Narmoo S1 simply by changing the tips. The S1 has slightly better bass but the 100 has much better treble and has a better fit.
2.TTPOD T2. Does everything better,when I listen to jazz,than the TTPOD T1 except soundstage but I can live with that.
3.Narmoo S1. Fatiguing treble and large size were its weakness but still a fun IEM.
4. MEElectronics M Duo. Inferior to the S1 all the way around except with the fit.
5. TTPOD T1. I only used it for one genre 'cause that was all it was good for to my ears.
6. GranVela VJJB V1. The least fun sounding duo driver IEM that I own. Doesn't sound bad,just boring.
7. CoreCool V2. The only thing the V2 has going for it is its looks and detachable cables. They are both wasted on its recessed mids and sloppy bass.

I just happened to try some narrow bore silicone tips. They weren't too narrow to kill too much bass but they did improve the treble to my liking. I feel a little better liking the more expensive 100 again. .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

Finalized mods on some headphones.
 
1: Sansui SS-100: Rockwool felt and stock damping in earcup. Pads replaced with modified Shure SRH-550DJ earpads. Best of the bunch by a significant margin, very flat and clear. A tiny bit smeared in detail when compared to the ER-4S, but simultaneously more neutral and realistic sounding. Not comfortable. Don't sound good without proper amplification; these might have more room to scale.
 
2: Etymotic ER-4S: Using the foam tips and orange filters I got from a friend. Much more comfortable and still about the same as the stock frost triflanges soundwise: slightly dark sounding with treble peakage. Detail microscope. Good soundstage. Midrange tone is dead on. Don't play loud very well. Low bass roll off.
 
3: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: Foam frontwave damping (creatology around driver, open-cell over driver). Foam around driver in earcup and crammed into the driver vents. Rear cup covered in foam and poly-fil. Stock pads replaced with Brainwavz HM5 pleathers. Converted to dual entry using parts from a second, broken M10-II. Various cosmetic mods and touch-ups. By far my most involved project here. Sound is like the TH900: Boosted bass and treble but maintains good clarity and detail throughout the frequency range. Probably not as detailed as the TH900. Extremely good soundstage. These aren't bad by any means, but they are quite colored, which keeps me from using them often (these will probably see more work due to this).
 
4: Toshiba HR-810: Earcups closed with electrical tape from the inside. Felt stuck to rear of cup. Stock pads replaced with decayed and cleaned Pioneer SE-700 earpads. These probably aren't done either. Very good; flat and crisp. However, the lack of seal on the ear side prevents them from pushing bass. I had non-decayed SE-700 pads on them before, which allowed them to physically slam your skull, but one got damaged and as a result I had to change them to something else. Trying to find another earpad that works well before sending them off to their new owner.
 
5: Pioneer SE-500: Literally the exact same situation as above, to a worse extent. Cups closed with tape, felt layered with that. Pads do not seal and bass does not slam. Quite bright and not pleasant sounding. These have potential, but the problem here is that the pads are an odd shape, so suitable replacements are much harder to find. My only idea at this point is more extreme mods involving converting them to over ear and modifying the yoke structure.

Those original tips are a disaster, at least for me. They don't fit well at all.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

I was using wide bore tips for a while because they fit so well but that made the 100 a one trick pony to my ears. Especially going from a smartphone to a Fiio X1 to an iBasso DX50.

IEM's
 
 
1. Yamaha EPH-100 for being the best all-rounder. 
 
2. Core Cool V2. I used to dog the V2 because I compared to the Yamaha but that was a mistake. I like the V2's bass despite not being as good as the Narmoo S1's bass but the V2 doesn't have the S1's excessive treble.
 
3. Brainwavz R3. I have a love/hate relationship with it mainly because of the fit but I love them for jazz. The R3 has great isolation and bass which are key for commuting on a bus. The T2
 
4. Knowledge Zenith DT5. The DT5 could be ranked where the Core Cool V2 is because it has better treble than the V2 & S1 but it falls behind with less bass impact.
 
5. Tuna X6. The best soundstage that I have heard in a budget IEM.

Some changes...
 
1: Sansui SS-100: No change in mods here, though I'm considering doing something to boost the upper midrange, and maybe even tuning the bass a bit looser.
 
2: Etymotic ER-4S: Now using yellow filters and Shure biflange eartips. General character remains unchanged but more bass and better comfort has been achieved.
 
3: Pioneer Monitor 10-II: earpad change to Brainwavz angled velours. More foam in front of the driver. Low bass rolls off now but everything is much flatter, speedier, and more neutral. Still, not a very pleasant listen. I want more bass. Might change the pads again. 
 
4: Sennheiser HD700: Filter paper over driver. Creatology foam covering the inside of the enclosure. Rear of driver dampened with blutak and dense felt. Nice sounding until you hit 6kHz. These have a peak that I can't seem to get rid of. Continuing to work on this.

It is an exceptional HP, and the comfort is incredible! Listening to a little Floyd on my 560 presently and they are hot ands uncomfortable. Which surprises me, I thought they were quite comfortable until I had the HD800 (& HEK).
 
Looking forward to the Norne Draug 2 finally arriving, from past experience it warms the sound of the 800 up, adds quite a bit of bass slam, and makes the soundstage even more expansive.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Folks, I've found your rankings and comments very helpful.  When I know a couple of cans on the list, together with comments, I can imagine what it may be like to audition the others on a head-fier's list.  I'm looking to add to my collection with a planar magnetic for the precise and deep bass (but you'll see my preferred sound signature is on the bright side); a bluetooth (the V-Moda Wireless with an evidently slightly brightened M-100 sound is intriguing) and an open or semi-open that's comfortable for long at-desk use.  That may be the Beyerdynamic DT 880 600 ohm, based on your listings.  But first -- I have to get my wife to sell the house.    
 
My ranking:
 
1. Grado RS-1 (open, foam pads over-ear).  Admittedly, the allure of the wood cups sold me, initially, with the promise of being better sound than the Grado SR-80s I already owned. The RS-1 is surely better.  (At six times the price, huh, you'd hope so.)  Several months of ecstasy.  But I no longer hear these as the highest fidelity cans ever. Main benefit: it fulfills my needs for an "edge" to Pete Townsend guitar and Maynard Ferguson-like brass.  I also like the sense that the bass is "tight" but have come to realize that I'm trading off a bit in experiencing depth and resonance to that bass when using these.  Ergonomically, they are light, but headband is not comfy.  Amazingly good right out of an iPhone 4s, but scale with a greater authority to the sound when amped.
 
2.  AKG Q701 (Quincy Jones), velour pads over ear.  Since retailers seem to be clearing these out and I got them recently, definitely my highest-value buy.  I think of these as the highest-fidelity I own, but they don't come to life until attached to one of my Schiit amps (Asgard 2 the best of them) and the volume knob is turned up.  (That worries me a bit, I try not to overdo it.)  I love the ease with which they cover-yet-float on my ears.  But, as noted often by other owners, those bumps on the top band can cut a listening session short compared to how long my ears would like to continue.  Maybe I can get my step-daughter to re-purpose a cat's sweater to cover that headband.  (Don't sneeze, she has a Sphinx cat, no fur.  See?  Not so crazy.)
 
3.  NAD Viso HP50, closed, provides 3-button/mic cable, works with V-Moda's boom mic (yay!).  My least-preferred sound signature of the top 3 but the most comfortable top-of-head experience; doesn't bother wife in bed (good isolation for passive); works as well with iPhone 4s as it does amped (somewhat strangely, but it is rated at 32 ohm, so evidently this impression of mine could be "true.")  Many skilled listeners think the NAD is great with an intended roll-off to the treble that is ideal.  I want more treble, 'nuff said.  Tweaking EQ on Sandblaster E5 that "lives" on the bed stand helps but doesn't achieve perfection for me.  Here in Florida, leather-like ear pads can get hot after an hour even in AC.  I wonder if I can replace pads with Shure Alcantara, anybody know?
 
4.  Sennheiser Momentum On-Ear (original).  Super-comfortable Alcantara pads, headband fine once stretched a bit.  My portable go-to, lots of fun right out of iPhone with a U-shaped rise in mid-bass and mid-treble, gets my feet to moving as they should.  Pairs with SB E5 dac/amp similarly.  Handsome ivory-brown and not humongous.  Given that I KNOW these are not as faithful to "true" sound, I'm amazed at how much fun I have with these when walking - but they disappoint as soon as I sit down and plug them into a Schiit, say the Vali. Clearly not faithful to "true" sound.  So I guess my needs change when (a) in motion and/or (b) I'm upping volume to counter outside noises.  Any future Bluetooth cans would have to give me this same fun feeling before replacing these as my portables.
 
5.  Grado SR-80.  Reading up on these after being impressed by them is what turned me from a speaker-only listener to a person who hunted for a better HP experience.  A good quest.  Had not realized that a reasonably priced (under $100) HP could be: dynamic driver; airy sound; crisp treble yet undeniable bass, although more tight than deep and resonant.  Essentially RS-1 "light", as I later discovered.
 
6.  Plantronics Backbeat Bluetooth in-ear.  Flabby bass, decent mids, treble.  Essentially replaced by the Momentum On-ear.
 
7.  Sony V-6 circa 1980.  The HP that kept me from investigating other HP for decades.  Tin can sound: no air, reedy treble, flabby bass.  Comfortable though, until ears get hot.
 
Once owned Audio-Technica electret HP ("electret" is different/less costly than electrostatic). These AT used a converter box to be run off the speaker-amp output of (at the time) my receiver.  Grado-like mid and treble cloud-like experience, very fine.  But lacking true bass, pricy and the opposite of portable, umm, let's call it... troll-like stability, hunkered under the receiver.  But what these were capable of, compared to the failings of the Sony above, had me convinced that dynamic driver HP wouldn't achieve that lovely airy sound, by definition.  So you can perhaps see why the Grado SR-80 discovery a couple of years ago literally turned my head.
 
Between the Sony V-6 and the Grado SR-80s I experimented with low-cost in ears.  A Shure version was nice but self-destructed way too soon for their price tag.  Cheap Denons were a value-buy sonically (discount shelf at Wal-Mart! Whaddaya know!) but didn't have tips that worked well in my ears.  Other IEM not worth mentioning.
 
So now I'm on head-fi and having fun.  Thanks folks!

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: Sansui SS-100: Pads swapped again, now to slightly modified HiFiMAN Focus-A earpads. Holy soundstage, batman! Not dark and suffocating anymore. Sometimes a bit bright/sharp sounding. Treble is clean and smooth but there's way too much of it -- think DT990 600 (premium, new production). Trying to get it to calm down, though it could be my amp (which some people consider bright). Lots of balls (low bass extension). Extremely good blackground and resolving power.
 
2: Sennheiser HD700: Not revealing the details regarding mods on these yet, but they are modified, significantly. Bass goes deep and can shake your head, and has an almost speaker-like presentation. Most balls I've ever heard from an open dynamic by far. Tonality is somewhat HD650-like: gentle downwards slant, but a bit more bite as you go up. This is not necessarily a good thing. Soundstage is very cohesive and 3-dimensional, with a good placement range on both axes. Resolving power superior to HD650 but slightly behind the Sansui. Upper midrange slightly grating/"grainy" -- Sounds like subtle, tiny variations in the FR; a lack of ultimate smoothness.
 
Bonus: Custom Sansui SS-35: These are an afterthought for now, but I figured I should say something about them. These have had their drivers replaced with new production drivers. With Brainwavz HM5 pleather earpads, these briefly sounded better than even the SS-100, but I need to buy another pair of pads to be sure (sold them off with another headphone).

What puts the HD650 above the LCD-2 in your mind? Even though I loved my pair of HD650, I always found the LCD-2 to be a natural improvement on the HD650's sound and would've preferred to own them. Then again, the LCD-2s I auditioned were all pre-Fazor.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


And my question would be: What puts M50 over HE-500?  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Though this is still highly driven by the fact that I only recently bought the LCD-2, I still find myself reaching for the HD650 instead sometimes. There is just something really romantic about the HD650s sound to me. I got the LCD-2 because I saw it as a natural step up from the 650 but so far it's more so been a step to the side. Really though,I feel my equipment may not be up to snuff for the LCD-2 to reach its potential. I think it's held back more than any of my headphones. I got it though because I have heard it on really great systems and it was such an amazing phone from what I remember. So I bought it so I can purely focus on building my equipment around it. The 650 I'll get a bottlehead crack for soon enough haha.

This is purely time probably. I've owned the HE-500 for a week and I adore the M50 and while the HE-500 has a more detailed and balanced sound, I haven't gotten much enjoyment out of it yet. Mind you its hard to get head time with it right now. I have three new headphones I'm trying to listen to haha. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Because my subjective opinion is that source gear is very important in pairing and resulting sound, then I will note it out here:

 
With both setups considered (very similar sounding - neutral with slight hint of warmth) my list is:
 
 
1) Fidelio X1 (custom recabling)
2) KZ ATE-b FF-mod (Oak wood backplates + open-back grill-mod + IE800 cable + ED9 brass nozzles + smallest KZ whirlwind tips)
3) Superlux HD-681 (Fran`s mkII hw filter + custom velour pads + Van Damme XKE Pro-Patch dual-entry recabling)
4) KZ ED9 (brass nozzles)
5) Superlux HD-662F (custom hw filter + custom velour pads + Van Damme XKE Pro-Patch dual-entry recabling)
6) KZ ANV (Mahogany wood backplates + no-name wide-bore silicone tips)
 
Sorry that I also brought out some IEM`s... wanted to show how they relate/stand in that list against full-size headphones.
Actually 1 and 2 are similar sounding with quite small SQ/signature difference with source gears I have.

from top to bottom-
*senn HD580 precision= 8 overall, whole-range, they are the most transparent and comfortable cans [for the money] I've had the privilege of using. great for those of us with big ears.
*senn HD565 ovation=8 bass and low-mids, 7 upper mids/treble. less transparent than the 580, not quite transparent enough for mastering work but very pleasurable music-listening cans. very comfy for the big-eared crowd.
*senn HD449=7 bass low-mids, 7 upper mids/trebles, similar to 565 but slightly closed in [makes sense as they are closed-back] as well as a bit bass-heavy. not strictly neutral, mildly euphonic, a mellower alternative to the 565  and among the best closed-back cans I've heard in terms of openness.  ear cups a bit small for the large-eared and firm, sticks to us sweaty types.
*skull candy crusher=5 overall, 6 bass, 4 mids and 3 trebles, very closed-sounding cans but with EQ can sound acceptable for most music listening. the bass resonator mildly colors the rest of the mid-bass range even when not energized and this can't really be EQ'ed out. when energized the mid-bass is overwhelming at any setting, plus they have a bit of the digital "on/off" quality with much music, you turn the slider down a bit and the resonator seems to drop off a cliff. no matter, they have small ear cups which aren't a comfortable match for my big elephant ears and when I sweat they get pretty sticky, so I will likely give them to somebody deserving sometime holiday-like.

Head-time:
1.  HE-6 (modded - Audeze Vegan Pads, stock grills (removed acoustic fiber), Beyer Foam Insert) directly off speaker taps on Pioneer Spec 2
2.  HD650 modded - coin mod, remove back damping
3.  Alpha Dogs - seriously underrated.  Mine were an early pair so might have a better tune?
 
4.  DT880 Pro 250 Ohm.  Go to for live sound and gigs, surprisingly good for the money
5. HE-500 - Not bad at all especially w Fuzzor mod and Jerg Pads.  Just not used because HE-6...nuff said.
6.  MA900 - probably the best imaging I've heard apart from HD800.  Not enough bass for me although surprisingly natural sounding.
 
Gaming:
1.  HD650 - great comfort, sound, 3D imaging.
2.  Alpha Dogs - I would say this has better 3D imaging than HD650.  However, I prefer open headphones usually.
3.  HE-6 - for when I want sub bass and reference quality sound.  Good imaging but stretched L - - C - - R instead of L - C - R.  Not much depth so poor 3D imaging.
don't use the rest for gaming

they are actually really good but the two above are just that much better. 
 
the lcd3 sound 3d and spacious, but they are open back.   these things are impressive but do need amp power
 
the roxannes have more micro details and space, bass is more refined.  
 
but dont get me wrong the el-8 are great for the price.

Ok thanks. Because ive auditioned them three times (open and closed) and am getting ready to pull the trigger on something. Figures today though I heard Grado 325e with large bowl pads and it just sparkled and sounded even better than the EL-8.
Still would like an EL-8C down the road at some point.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


What do you like about the HAMT-1 that puts it above the HD800 in your mind?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Hi there,
 
I think Obravo this time amazes audiophile by launching an innovative circuit combining an air motion transducer and sub-woofer. The AMT unit is responsible for delivering treble and mid-range while the sub-woofer delivering the bass. HAMT-1 is definitely not as analytical as HD800, which may make it as a shortcoming in many audiophile's opinion. But to me, I particularly really like its bass and the rendition of the vocal. HD800 of course has a powerful bass, but comparing with HAMT-1, I would say the sense of depth offered by the latter is more and its solidness impressively gets to your head.
 
For the vocal, there is a sense of realism, vividness and airy presence that are very different from the traditional dynamic headphone. In this area, its rendition bears a large degree of resemblance to electrostatic headphones, which I relishing listening to them. I guess the AMT unit plays an important role in rendering the mid-range and the treble delicately.
 
Plus I agree with most of the commentary that it doesn't sound like a headphone, but having a signature between headphone and loudspeakers. So HAMT-1 did give me a very fresh impression upon first listening. I absolutely enjoy the listening experience after purchasing it.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



One more note to add. Actually I was quite disappointed by the sound out of the box, because the bass was disorderly, the mid-range was plagued by emptiness and the treble was constricted. I was so disappointed that I voiced my discontent to the vendor, who said it would need 300 - 600 hours of run-in time to exhibit its normal performance. So I keep burning it in using my STS Burn-in CD. To my relief and excitement, HAMT-1 keeps improving and improving. I would say it reaches a settling phase at 700 - 800 hours, making itself an adorable headphone.
 
Anyway, it may be a matter of personal preference to rank HAMT-1 above HD800, no absolute right or wrong. Do you own both headphones? Let me know how you think. Thanks.

I do not own an HAMT-1, but I have an acquaintance who's considering purchasing a pair. It may not really be worth the trouble right now, since there's no established U.S. distribution and it's hard to find many thorough impressions of the model. I find them fascinating, but I would have to hear them myself to consider buying a set.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I use the Woo WA6 SE with the 6FD7 tubes. This amp is not optimal for the HE 6, but it does get plenty loud and sounds very good to me, even when compared to driving them directly from a speaker amp.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Audeze LCD-2 revision 1
Great FR-balance with a touch of warmth. Yes, that BASS is easily the best of this bunch: it goes all the way down and stays clean and punchy. They seem to make even some very compressed tracks sound open and clear. Mids are on par with my Senn-references (HD600 & HD650) - highs are better with a more natural sound on cymbals etc. Comfort is fine too with the new Audeze pads, the weight doesn't bother me in at-home-listening. My pair has a Canare cable with a Neutrik/Rean plugs, no problems at all.
 
 
2. Sennheiser HD600
A while ago I had HD650's too, but they were slightly too warm in comparison (also very similar in other ways). HD600 is my reference in neutrality - I can trust the frequency range very well when mixing etc. Mids are a certain highlight... Vocals sound very natural and distorted guitars rock like a beast. They have a slightly colder sound than the LCD's, maybe because of a bit less bass. Comfort is good and I even think this series of phones looks quite good, minus the fake-headstone plastics on the 600's.
 
3. Denon D2000
Great bass for hip-hop, metal etc. Surprisingly good soundstage for a "kinda" closed can. In pure sound quality they compete well with HD6xx's. Great comfort, kind of weak build and a cumbersome wire. Only for home use.
 
4. Focal Spirit Professional
These just might climb up the list, got them yesterday. SQ is quite neutral, with a "mix-ready" freq range. Less highs than my other mixing-tool (HD600), more bass. Very surprised about the soundstage and flat lows. The tight clamp provides nice isolation, all I hear when out-and-about is the music & the thump of my footsteps. I listened to them for about two hours yesterday, with only small problems with comfort at the end. Let's hope they last, seeing all the broken headbands this model has had. (Got a 3 year warranty from Thomann, which was nice.)
 
5. Creative Aurvana Live!
Awesome bang for your buck. The Fostex-made little sibling of D2000's, with a bit less bass slam and soundstage. Very comfortable, kind of a cheap construction.  If only these sealed better, they would still be very close to being my number one portable.
 
6. V-Moda M100
That bass was all I read about these before I got them - but, they are not too far gone in that respect. Bass has a big presence for sure, but it usually doesn't get overblown for my tastes (depending on the track). Maybe that boost should start at a lower frequency though, since on some mixes they might sound a bit boomy. Anyhoo, they have a much bigger soundstage + more details and clarity than I expected. The highs are smooth and non-sibilant. One can really jack up the volume without being too concerned about losing their hearing. The construction is the best of all portable cans I've tried. This is how you make a headphone to take all the abuse you can think of. Comfort is only ok, since I have a big head. They fit "just", when fully extended, not so much when I have a hat on. I ordered the XL pads last week, still waiting for 'em.
 
7. Beyerdynamic DT770 80 ohm
Built like a tank, truly comfortable. My first pair of "good" headphones. Bass and highs are boosted with a hint of sibilance. Overall it's a real contender still for an affordable well-sealing closed can. Way better than the ATH-M50's I had for a while (no soundstage, quite sibilant highs and shouty overall sound signature - what is the hype all about?).
 
8. Sennheiser Momentum
Very nicely built, pretty set of cans. Bass is strong and kind of all over the place, mids are quite nice. There's is little treble energy, which makes for a pleasant listen. Pretty comfortable for my ears, even with the small pads. In SQ-terms, 300 euros/dollars is a bit too much. But, these "fashion-phones" with different priorities. The 2nd version of over-ears seemed way more comfortable, like a pair of huge pillows around your head. SQ was quite similar, very very warm.
 
9. Sennheiser IE8
Nice comfort and a great cable (sadly with no controls or mic). Warm - it's the Sennheiser house sound, I guess. The highs are slightly unnatural when comparing to my over-ear portables. Nothing really to write home about in terms of SQ, but they get the job done o a hot summer day.
 
10. Ultimate Ears Triple.Fi 10
Much better SQ than IE8's, but - there is a big but. They need lots of work to put on with the flimsy and tangly cable and large nozzles. Good seal is a must, otherwise they sound very thin. When you get them in your ears properly, they sound great. They are quite bright and natural in FR terms - after LCD-2, HD600 and Spirit Pro they have the most flat and trustworthy sound signature.
 
Amping
I'm driving my at-home-phones through Apogee Duet's DAC & Schiit Lyr 2. (Duet's amp works also very well with basically all of my phones, nice amp for not really being a headphone amp!) When mobile, I mostly use my iPhone 5S - sometimes Fiio E7+iPod Touch. Momentum gets most advantage from an amp.
 
EDIT: Got a bit carried away :D I guess I could expand this into an article with photos etc... - where should I post it?  :)

1: Sansui SS-100 (modified): Focus-A earpads. Single rockwool felt damping disc from a B&O U70 over rear of driver. Stock pads removed. Low bass and high treble to die for. Slight 8kHz peak and ringing. Soundstage has some holes. Slightly "crisp" coloration -- slight odd-order distortion in the lower treble. Extremely resolving. Very very comfortable for a planar; my RP18 physically hurts me by comparison.
 
2: Sennheiser HD700 (heavily modified): Use Google if you want to find out what I did; too much to describe promptly. No more 6kHz problem. Extremely resolving, perhaps even slightly moreso than the Sansui. Top-shelf comfort. Massive soundstage, very 3D and coherent. Imaging is fantastic. A bit sterile; very very unforgiving. Slightly rolled off at the extremes of the FR; this is what put it behind the Sansui the most, for me. 
 
3: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (heavily modified): New earpads; something from a cheap hearing protection earmuff with a radio in it. Not comfortable, but by far the best for the sound: Almost completely flat from DC to 2kHz. Slight rolloff at upper extremes and a null at 4kHz -- yeah, a real null. If it was in a more sensitive area of the FR, it would be very problematic, but really it just sounds kind of dull overall. Absolutely ridiculous bass and power handling; LCD-2 plus dynamic impact. Fantastic 3D soundstage and imaging, if a bit small compared to the open stuff.
 
Nothing else sees use.

sennheiser momentum on ear
Not comfortable for long periods of time, but I like the soundstage.
 
bose quiet comfort 25
Perfect for a noisy office. I tend to EQ them as they don't sound great flat, but are comfortable and do an amazing job of silencing a room.
 
Sony xba-h1
A little underpowered by my ipod nano - works great with my sansa clip. A little bulky and not really bass heavy, but a great sound.
 
rha 450i.
These might be my favorite all arounders. Had the 600i for 2 months - fell apart and the warranty wasn't honored. The volume control broke on these, after a month and are being replaced by newegg (rha again wouldn't honor the 3 year warranty). I wish the build quality was better, as I love the sound when I'm on the move. Any suggestions of alternates would be appreciated.

Sennheiser HD201s; (Good balance, smooth presentation, kinda lush)
 
Audio Technica A900Xs; (Missing an upper-mid octane + upper bass bump sucks the life out of some music entirely - otherwise excellent)
 
Project Audio Hear-it Ones; (So nearly 1/2 on the list)
 
Brainwavez Deltas; (I did really like them though)
 
Sony MDR-7506s; (1 for monitoring my own voice though)

1. STAX SR-009 - My favorite
2. STAX SR-007MKI - Could be #1, but I want a little more touch of sonic detail
3. SONY MDR-R10 Bass Heavy - King of mids
4. PIONEER SE-Master 1 - Really like the sub-bass presentation and the warmth in the sound on acoustic instrumentations
5. ENIGMAcoustics Dharma D1000 (NEW ENTRY) - Reminds me of the modded K340 with a more better quality in highs
6. JPS Labs Abyss AB-1266 - King of bass
7. STAX SR-007MKII - A little too boomy, even with modding but quite fun
8. SENNHEISER HE60 - Quite good but a little too thin and a lack of bass section
9. SENNHEISER HD800 - The bang for the buck in electrodynamics and a classic now (I really like the Anaxilius mod one)
10. KENNERTON Odin (NEW ENTRY) - General presentation is quite impressive, but need to tweak the headband otherwise too weighty on head for long sessions
11. SONY Qualia Q-10 - A collector item
12. AKG K1000 Bass Heavy - Speakers on your head, king of soundstage
13. AKG K812 - Many opposite reviews on these headphones, I like them; total personal opinion
14. HIFIMAN HE-6 - Very good heaphones, even better than HE-1000 with a very good amp
15. HIFIMAN HE-1000 (NEW ENTRY) - Rather calm and peaceful musical reproduction, but I prefer the HE-6
16. BEYERDYNAMIC T1 MKII (NEW ENTRY) - Quite good, but not more than that; not very different from the first edition
17. BEYERDYNAMIC DT1770 (NEW ENTRY) - Quite an improvement over DT770, but they cannot compete with the others higher in the list, nonetheless rather good Q/P rating
18. FOSTEX TH900 - I like these headphones, but they are TOO bassy for a long-time session - reserved for quick moment of pure fun
19. BEYERDYNAMIC DT880 Pro - a classic since 15 years, I don't want to part from these
 
Sold :
BEYERDYNAMIC T1 - Mk.II is a little bit better and I don't need to have two revisions of these
AUDEZE LCD-X - LCD-4 in coming, probably, if I can discuss of a more better price or on second-hand item
ULTRASONE Edition 12 - Don't stand again the list, need to dispose of these

Really ?!? Did you mean HD205 or 280 ?
 
I thought they were always a highly rated closed headphone. Graham Slee's favourite.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Oh, sorry that was a typo - I meant the HD205s.
 
I should probably clarify that they're not objectively poor headphones. The bass response on the 205s is pretty forward as is the high-end, and the clamping force is huge; those are just generally things I don't like, but I can imagine that others do :)

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1. Westone W50 - Hits the spot in my ears
2. Westone W20 - very bright and forward sounding but overall pretty nice
3. Hifiman RE-400 - Really good for its price
4. Etymotic Research ER-4 - No.4 due to horrible cables and comfort
5. Campfire Audio Lyra - Doesn't suit my listening tastes, too warm and not "forward sounding" enough
6. Final Audio Heaven II - Very flat and neutral sounding much like ckb50s but with wider soundstage and overall more refined, horrible flat cables produce too much microphonicsEdited by wongzuohan - 11/18/15 at 10:34am

Have you had any significant experience with the older PS1000i? I used to own a pair, but I've never tried the "e" revision and I'd be interested to know how they differ.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Sorry ssrock64, this is my first pair of PS1000 & I bought them new.  You can check out the "Grado PS1000 Impressions" thread or the "Grado e series" thread where you may find info about the two compared.  Good luck.

1. Grado 325 w/ wood cups,quarter mod flat pads and "upgraded" cable. Perfect for taking a break from the HE-500
2. Grado 125i w/ Vibro cups. I would not personally consider another headphone for jazz
3. Hifiman HE-500. It will sit until I decide if I want another amp for it.
 
IEM
 
1. Yamaha EPH-100. The best IEM I have ever owned.
2. Brainwav R3. Great sound stage but doesn't do bass well at all.
3. Corecool V2. I like it for it what it does well:Bass and mids. Unfortunately either the detachable cable or the connector makes them cut in and out.
3. Knowledge Zenith DT5. Tightens the bloated bass on my smartphone.

Adding the APs to the mix:
 
1. Beyerdynamic T90 -- Still in love with (almost) everything about these phones. Maybe the bass is a bit lacking but the highs...
1. MrSpeakers Alpha Prime with DUM cables -- Probably will be the sole 1. some day. Great closed headphones but I still miss a bit of the T90's "crispy" highs. Also I would rank the fit only at 8/10.
2. Sennheiser HD595 -- Good allrounder
....
3. Sennheiser Urbanite On-Ear -- hate the fit with these phones. SQ is meh..
....
....
4. Soundmagic e10
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

An update from me:
 
1. Beyerdynamic T90 - simply fantastic sounding headphones with open, spacious and very crisp and precise performance. 
1. Hifiman HE-500 - The best allrounder I have ever heard, very detailed, good soundstage and very transparent and natural sound.
2. Philips Fidelio X2 - nicely open with a large soundstage but at the same time very pleasently dark performance. Nice bass and musicality.
2. Sennheiser HD650 - Transparent, lush and smooth performance.
 
For me T90+HE-500 is probably the end-game combination. With my X-Can V3 (modded) and Matrix M-Stage (modded) there is absolutely nothing I miss from far, far more expensive combinations.

Sony mdr 100 aap; Genuine moments of euphony for the first time IMHO at this price range, delicious SQ, perfect blend with the Sony A10, easily powered.
 
Sony mdr zx 700; Studio monitor, a bit of warmth as well, sadly neglected in view of the above. 
 
Sony H3; Yes the bass obtrudes in to the mids, but a glorious battleship sound stage keeps it in employment.

Last ranking of the year
1. Grado 125i w/ wood cups. I get the most pleasure from them despite making them genre specific.
2. Hifiman HE-500. Love 'em for rock,metal and various electronic genres.
3. Grado 325 w/ wood cups and "upgraded" cable. I like them but not as thrilling as when I first received them.
4. Hifiman He-300. The one that started it all. I am rediscovering it after fixing it a while back,adding a shorter cheap cable,different pads and pairing it with my smartphone from time to time.
5. Audio Technica ATH-PRO700MK2. Good for commuting during winter and when I get in a rare basshead mood.Edited by dwayniac - 12/19/15 at 2:41pm

An update for the end of the year.
I've downsized a part of the collection.
 
1. STAX SR-009 - My favorite - detailed, precise, very true to the recordings
2. STAX SR-007MKI - Could also be #1, but it just lacks a bit of sonic detail when I do a direct comparison against the SR-009
3. SONY MDR-R10 Bass Heavy - King of mids and the best of SONY in music equipment from 1989; the membrane is VERY fragile - must be cared with precaution
4. PIONEER SE-Master 1 - Really like the sub-bass presentation and quite addictive
5. STAX SR-007MKII - A little too boomy, even with modding but it remains a flagship STAX and .. what a ride, baby!
6. SENNHEISER HD800 - The bang for the buck in electrodynamics, don't need to describe them much
7. KENNERTON Odin - A real preference against the Abyss, more refined sound - needs a total tweak on the headband, otherwise too weighty and uncomfortable
8. HIFIMAN HE-6 - A real frank sounding headphones from HiFiman, needs a really powerful amp
9. AKG K1000 Bass Heavy - Speakers on your head, king of soundstage, needs also a very powerful amp
10. AKG K812 - Many opposite reviews on these headphones, I like them on moderate levels as an everyday headphones, sound seems a little bit compressed to be fair
11. SONY Qualia Q-10 - A collector item and very detailed, but could be harsh with high levels and sound synthetic with classical music
12. FOSTEX TH900 - I like these headphones, but they are TOO bassy for a long-time session - reserved for quick moment of pure fun
13. BEYERDYNAMIC T1 MKII - Quite good, but it is the entry-level of flagship, we could do so much better (but at bigger prices)
14. BEYERDYNAMIC DT1770 (NEW ENTRY) - Quite an improvement over DT770, but they cannot compete with the others higher in the list, nonetheless rather good Q/P rating
15. BEYERDYNAMIC DT880 Pro - a classic since 15 years for me, one of the basics for beginning in the audiophile hobby
 
Sold :
ENIGMAcoustics Dharma D1000 - Reminds me that I'm missing my old and beloved AKG K340 (KT88 version)
AUDEZE LCD-4 - Didn't like the treble section and I prefered the sound signatures of the LCD-2 and LCD-3
JPS Labs Abyss AB-1266 - Bass is more full-bodied than the SE Master-1 and the Odin, but the latters are better on soundstage, clarity, 3D and less weighty than the Abyss
SENNHEISER HE60 - I prefer the STAX sound with my equipments, too thin on the bass section
HIFIMAN HE-1000 - Too much problems with QC (membrane tension) on 3 pairs within 5 months, so goodbye HE-1000

1.  Audeze LCD 2.2  specifically when driven by DecWare Taboo II
2.  Koss ESP 950...fast, smooth a bit lacking in slam.
3.  HifiMan HE500... driven by DecWare or Headroom Home with built in DAC.  Not as comfortable, but still sound good.
4.  Senn. HD700/HD650...each have their strengths.  HD650's on Bottlehead Crack.  HD700's were higher on the Woo WA2
5.  Denon 7100...good for listening to movies at night.  Strong bass, comfortable pads
6.  Grado 225i....punchy, little sub bass, hard to listen to on poorly recorded rock.  Work well with iPad.
 
These are the ones that have stayed in rotation after buying a selling for a couple of years.  Actually went back and bought
the HD700's and Koss 'stats a second time.  Source and amplification make a BIG difference.  I lean strongly into the tube
camp and love the DecWare and Woo amps.  For solid state the Gustard H10 is a great buy and for tubes, it's hard to beat
the Bottlehead with high impedance cans.   Using JRiver ver. 20 as music player...SOOOO much better than iTunes.
YMMV,
Hibuck...
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Philips Fidelio X2 - Jack of all trades, master of... the vast majority actually, in my opinion. Maybe just a tad too dark for some of my music.
2) Shure SRH840 - My first pair of "good" headphones. 4 years later, I still love them. Like the X2, they are very well suited for just about every purpose (aside from portability...).
3) Sennheiser HD598 - very bright and detailed, these are my preferred headphones for a lot of different instrumental music and music with emphasis on vocals. I also love them for punk and classic rock, which I think they present better than the X2s.
4) PSB M4U2 - I honestly hated these at first. Out of the box, they were just extremely uncomfortable due to the weight and clamping force. I actually planned on returning them and buying something else, but after breaking them in a bit and figuring out how to get them adjusted to distribute the weight a bit better, they're not nearly as bad as I thought they were. I don't like their sound as much as the SRH840, but I can't exactly pin down what I like less about them. In any case, they are competent portable headphones, so I decided to keep them.
5) Koss PRO DJ100 (m50 pads) - $50 headphones that sound like ~$250 headphones... I actually lost them during my first year of college; if I still had them, it would be very hard to justify keeping the PSBs.
6) Audio Technica ATH-m50 - I believe these to be one of the most overrated pairs of headphones I have ever encountered. Don't get me wrong, they aren't bad, but they are very V-shaped and in my opinion, excessively forward, so I just don't find them very versatile. Good for rap and electronic music, but I don't use them for much else.

HD600 is about as close to perfect I've heard in a headphone.  It is very natural sounding to me, instruments and voices sound spot on.  If I had to live with one headphone it would be the HD600, great recordings sound amazing and bad recordings sound great as well.  TH900 is nice for a change of pace but I wouldn't want it for my only headphone.

Of the ones I own:
 
Audeze EL-8 open
Shure SRH-840
Bang & Olufsen H6
Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 over ear
 
And the ones I've listened to:
 
Audeze EL-8 open - more neutral than LCD-2
Audeze LCD-2F - gorgeous!!! a little more neutral than LCD-2
Audeze LCD-2 - lush!!
Sennheiser HD650 - very similar balance to LCD-2 and EL-8, great for the price
Mr Speakers Ether - impressive, but not quite in the same league as the Audeze range imho
Sennheiser HD600 - great but not enough extension in the bass area, lacks soundstage
Shure SRH-840 - very balanced but a tad forward highs (easily fixed with EQ), average soundstage
Shure SRH-940 - a tad more harsh than the SRH-840, terrible build quality
Bang & Olufsen H6 - lacking some lower mids, but gorgeous soundstage and treble response, fun to listen to, great build
Bower & Wilkins P7 - great soundstage and balance, just a tad too laid back for me, great build
ENIGMAcoustics Dharma - nice, but upper octave of treble is too forward
Beyerdynamic DT880 pro 250 ohms - very balanced, but lower treble a bit too forward
Oppo PM-3 - treble too rolled off and tiny soundstage
NAD Viso HP50 - very good, but lower treble a bit too forward
Hifiman HE-560 - dirty sounding lower treble, too forward sounding
AKG Q701 - not enough bass, unrealistic mids / soundstage
Audio Technica MSR-7 - quite nice, but very lower harsh treble
Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 over ear - treble too rolled off
Bose QC25 - good balance and noise cancellation, but quality of sound is average at best
Sennheiser HD800 - low end is far too recessed and highs are piercing
AKG K801 - same as HD800
Sennheiser HD700 - unmusical balance, didn't like these at all
Sennheiser HD280 Pro - strange frequency response, but nice mids, no soundstage at all
Audio Technica ATH-M50 / M50x - no mids, bloated bass, small soundstage
Beyerdynamic DT250 - heavily rolled off treble, terrible fit, small soundstage
Ultrasone Performance 840 - worst headphones I've heard by far, puke worthy
 
I plan to listen to the following:
 
Audeze LCD-3
Audeze LCD-X
 
And I'll give the HP50, HE-560, Ether, HD800 and Dharma another chance :)

My latest top 4:
1 Beyerdynamics T1 ver. 2. (The only thing the HD-800 consistently beats it on is soundstage size)
1a Sennheiser HD-800 (So close, like neck and neck - but T1 edges it out, and T1 is MUCH easier to pair with SS amps for best sound quality)
2 Sennheiser HD-650 (Still awesome! But now I know what next level T1 & HD-800 sounds like...)
3 AKG K-545/550 (Completely tied as it depends on music type. Pop/modern = K545, classical/folk/world = K550)
4 Koss PortaPros with "pleather" ear pad mod (Makes EVERYTHING while on the go sound pretty good!)
Honorable mention: Basshead-specific: JVC HA-SZ2000 best of everything I've ever heard for my occasional highly-amped & EQ'd basshead sessions. BUT MUST BE AMPED AND BASS-BOOSTED. There are better options for playback straight out of a phone or DAP/MP3 player.Edited by knorris908 - 1/13/16 at 2:41pm

Updated Top 10
 
1) HifiMan HE-1000 w/ Silver Dragon cable - Favorite and most listened to headphone.  They do everything right.
2) Fostex TH-X00 - Crazy, right?  At just $400 dollarsI I love this headphone for its bass.  Not the best soundstage, but they're so fun.  Lack sparkle in the highs, but surprising detail.
3) Sennheiser HD-800 - OK, it's better than the Fostex, but because I listen to the HEK and Fostex so much, it's now third on my list of "go-to" headphones.  Still the most comfortable.
4) Bowers & Wilkins P7 - A good time in a portable package. What's not to like?  Comfy.
5) UERM - I use these at work.  Not the end-all of fidelity, but they're not intended to be.  This is a dead-neutral custom in-ear with outstanding isolation.  
6) Grado 225 - These are gathering dust.  Decent sound, just not on my radar.
7) Klipsch X10- My favorite consumer earbud.  I use them for working out.  Very V shaped but my favorite consumer-grade in-ear. High praise.  Seat them deep in the ear.
8) Audio Technica AT-M50 - Great for around $100 bucks.  But not great.
9) HifiMan RE-0 Can't get a good read on these and they're uncomfortable
10) Beats Tour - better than you think.  They really shine with video and movies.

Only our opinions, so no "rights" or "wrongs", but I totally agree with your HD-650 Blues designation! They were my absolute favorite headphones from the beginning, until I recently got HD-800s and T1s (both old and version2). While the HD-800 and T1s were clearly "superior" headphones, both my wife and I still loved the feel we got from the likes of Miles Davis or Robert Cray via the HD-650s.

Headphones that I actually use:
 
1. AKG K550 - At first I thought they lacked bass, but I started to love their sound and now they're always on my head (Until I get me an open headphone, which will be quite soon).
 
2. Sony MDR-1R - I really love the mids on these, and their comfort is just impressive.
 
3. Audio Technica ATH M40x - Well... they're fine. I use them on the go.
 
4. Panasonic ErgoFit RP-HJE120 - Oh yes, a budget IEM. I prefer things to stay out of my ears, so I think this is the most expensive IEM I'll ever own.

Includes headphones I used to own:
 
(Own) 1. Audio-Technica AD1000x - Magical mids and fantastic bass, more so with alternative pads that space your ears away from the driver more like Brainwavz hm5 velour. Trying out Audeze microsuede soon. And I haven't even bought a proper amp/dac yet. Getting a NuPrime uDSD next week.
 
(sold) 2. Beyerdynamic DT880 pro 250ohm - Very smooth and linear top to bottom. Never sounded harsh/sibilant to me. More neutral than the more fun sounding AD1000x. Lacking something in the mids with inferior amplification, probably needs a mid rich tube amp for best sound. (Only sold because desperate for money)
 
(own) 2. Audio-Technica AD900x - Magical mids but bass a bit lacking.
 
(own) 3. Ultrasone pro 750 - Really needs good amplification even more than the Beyer. Thin in the mids and peaky/harsh in the highs. Grado and Beyer had an illicit affair and this was the baby which adopted most of the worst traits of it's parents. But better low bass than the Grado, more punchy but less homogenous and linear than the Beyer.
 
(gone) 4 Grado sr60/80 - Dynamic and exciting, like a kid with ADHD. But gets on your nerves after awhile, particularly if you push the volume level. Pretty good mids for rock, but harsh highs and slightly bloated midbass in an attempt to hide the fact that bass response drops off a cliff.
 
(gone) 5. Sony MDR-V6 - Been too long for a detailed description but don't remember anything exciting about it. Maybe a midbass tilt and smooth sound.

2)MDR-7520:
Portable fun and pretty nice at making me forgot I'm on the train! wonderful vocals make pimsluer easy to listen to.

Excellent for movies and gaming, good for music and is really good for aggressive rock but doesn't call me the same as the above.

Sometimes it's number 3 but is often to bright for my tastes, great all-arounder but is handedly beaten by the HE-500 as my go to all arounder.
 
6)K340:
Disclaimer: EASILY number one with the right music but is often to much of a specialist for my general listening; but man does live music sound amazing (Alice in chains unplugged is surreal through the K340)

All of these are very genre dependent; however, I feel that the Q701 is the best all-around.  Oddly enough, even though I don't love the sound of the T50RP MK3 (it's still very good), I find myself listening to it longer than the others when I'm actually using it.  There's just something about the sound that feels a little unnatural--like each of the instruments were recorded separately, and a composite recording was produced.  Despite this, it manages to do a lot of things right, making it very difficult to put down.
 
An equalizer might change the order slightly.  The DT 990 Pro might actually be Number 1 if EQ'd (sorry, purists), but I generally don't bother messing with it.  I assume that tubes might have a similar effect.  At the moment, I run everything through a O2/ODAC.

I guess I'll rank the headphones that I have owned around all the years, and according to my music preferences (lots of electronic music).
 
1) BeyerDynamic DT990 (the ones I currently have, just a bliss for Trance)
2) Fischer Audio FA-011 (That deep bass rumble makes me wish I still had them)
3) Fischer Audio FA-003 (Never knew a closed headphone could be this spacious, also loved their sound sig)
4) Sennheiser HD555 (The SoundStage is the best of them all, but they needed a bit more bass for my preferences. Vocals were glorious tho).
 
I think this is it for big headphones, dunno if I should add portables in there as well.

Mixing things up a bit...
 
1: HiFiMAN HE-6
2: Fostex T50-II
3: Sansui SS-100
 
All of these are very very close to each other in general, and the order could swap around at whim... at least with the HE-6 being driven from the Gustard.
 
As it stands, the HE-6 is the quickest, most resolving, and has the most ridiculous bass of these, the SS-100 is the smoothest and most natural sounding, and the T50-II is somewhere in between. 
 
All three are modded, and all three are absolutely fantastic sounding.

4) PSB M4U2
5) Shure SRH-840
6) Koss PRO DJ-100
7) Audio-Technica ATH-M50
 
 

My list has changed a bit, in a short period of time. The alterations:
1) Now that I have spent some time with the HE-560, the Philips X2's aren't quite as impressive anymore (still amazing for the price, though). It's unfair to judge them against a headphone that is 3x the price, but there is no question that they are significantly inferior. They are still great for bassy music where detail isn't a big concern, but I don't know if they're going to get much play time now that I have the Hifiman.
2) The SRH 840 is amazing, but after A/B'ing them with the Sennheisers, they aren't nearly as articulate or engaging. After using the PSB's for the whole trip to/from Nashville this weekend, they've started to grow on me as well. While not as good as the HD598, I do think they exceed the SRH 840 by an appreciable amount. When comparing them back and forth, the Shures just tend to sound a bit too smooth and laid back, and percussion doesn't quite have the impact that it should (listening to a jazz track for reference). Again, if price/performance comes into the equation, it changes things. In terms of "bang for your buck" between these three, I'd have to say the HD598 are on top, the SRH 840's take second place, and PSB's take 3rd, with current retail pricing. However, if the M4U 1 sounds the same as the M4U 2 in passive mode (which supposedly it does), then it would surpass the SRH840 in price/performance as well.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

[Updated on 3/15/16 to include my new LCD 2’s. Also added descriptions of my experiences with each]
 
Of all the pairs I own or have owned, hear's my ranking.
 
1) Audeze LCD 2(Fazor): Most fun and lively set of headphones I have. Walks on the line between analytical and pleasure listening to create the most refreshing and wonderful audio experience I have yet to come across.
 
2) HiFiman HE-400i: My go-to reference set of headphones. The neutrality and sheer honesty they deliver makes them extraordinary when I intend to listen to music for reviewing purposes. Only problem I have is with the horrendous stock cable which is short as can be and angled for some odd reason. But those quips are meaningless when the headphones as a whole are this fantastic.
 
3) MrSpeakers Alpha Prime (Sold): Best closed cans I have ever had in my possession. Sadly my amp that I had at the time was barely able to properly power the Primes. Even then, the Primes were absolute monsters in regards to bass and clarity. Despite the insane bulk of the headphones and equipment setbacks, they are indeed a wonderful piece of work.
 
4) AKG K7XX: My “pick up and play” reference pair. Kinda acts as the middle man between the raw representation of the 400i’s and the joyous nature of the LCD 2’s. Plus, they are beyond comfortable and the lightweight build makes them my least fatiguing set of headphones, no questions asked. The pads do collect lint like no tomorrow and the build does feel questionable at times, but honesty you can’t do better than this for a set of headphones under 300 dollars.
 
5) Philips SHP9500 (Given away as a gift): It’s really odd to accept the fact that a 75 dollar pair of headphones could have better soundstage than cans that are nearly four to five times the price, but that is exactly the case of the 9500’s. These are, no question, the best bargain in headphones. While that statement may be contradicting the claim regarding the K7XX’s, these are the pair you must go for if 200 dollars is too steep for one’s budget. Even with the lack of luxurious materials, the comfort and build on the 9500’s are mind-blowing. Sound is great especially for the price, but the way the Philips execute soundstage and imaging is out of this world for their price point. 
 
6) Sennheiser Momentum Over-Ear [M2] : One of, if not the best, portable headphone on the market currently. Yes, the 350 dollar MSRP is insane and even then makes purchasing these debatable, but if you ever see a sale where these dip below 300 dollars, jump on the M2’s ASAP. Sound and performance is perfectly tuned for passive and non analytical listening and the build quality and looks are magnificent. 
 
7) HiFiman HE-400s (Traded for the K7XX’s): In short, great headphones but in the realm of planars, these are exceptionally underwhelming in regards of build. Yes you get sound well worth the 300 dollar asking price but the build quality here is noticeably sub par, with flimsy plastics, loose grills and cheap stock pads making the pair as a whole feel like knock offs rather than an official HifiMan product.
 
8) Grado SR-80e: Treble beasts. Great fun to listen to but these guys need to be babied to high heaven as their build makes them very delicate. Comfort is an issue with all Grado headphones, and the foam material gets incredibly itchy and unpleasant to wear after only an hour of listening. In regards to sound, the SR80e’s are incredibly visceral and intense headphones to listen to, with great detailing paired with sharp yet enjoyable treble that really gets the adrenaline going. Honestly, I can’t really recommend these for what you pay, as 99 bucks is way too steep. However this is probably the Grado headphone to get if you insist on purchasing one of their products.
 
9) Audio Technica ATH-M50 (No longer have): My first true headphone and despite my great memories with it, it cannot even compare to many headphones around its price point. Detailing is phenomenal for what you pay and the bass is quite solid, but the way these headphones make music sound oddly artificial and without any soundstage negates all aforementioned praise. Plus comfort on these is quite horrendous, with the pads being made of material similar to the crappy padding you would find on headphones in school computer labs. They are not bad in the grand scheme of things, but just being alright could still make something eligible for being at the bottom of the totem pole.

What mod you did on HD650?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I removed foam and the plastic spider cage behind the driver magnet. I made a dime sized hole in the front pad (this one isn't very necessary it makes the sound focused coming out from the hole, but makes it higher resolution and clear (removing the front pads is nasty though). I have dynamat coming which I will apply to the back of HD650 to finish to mod. The mods done made my 650 more resolving and made it less dark, less veiled.
 


   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

From best to worst:
 
1) Denon D2000 - Still my favourite after 3 years (or 4) of having them.
2) Ultrasone HFI-780 - Had these for more than 5 years, and while I don't use them much, they're still so enjoyable for watching movies and playing videogames. Uncomfortable as hell though for extended periods.
3) Audio Technica ANC23 (Noise Cancelling) - Seriously these IEM's are awesome. Great sound! and they do a good job when you turn on the noise cancelling, no real loss in audio quality.
4) AKG K240MKII - These were my first high-end headphones. They're amazing for studio use and for their flat frequency response...but these days I find them too boring to listen to.
5) M-Audio Q40 - Great set of headphones and not very expensive. Barely use them, and they're definitely not as good as the other headphones on my list.
6) Apple In-Ear - I thought they were better than the Shure's when I first heard them...but in reality compared to the Audio-Technica's, they just don't sound that good anymore.
7) Shure SE210 - I honestly don't remember what these sound like and can't even seem to find them. My opinion would change if I heard them again I think.
 
Upcoming...MEE Audio Pinnacle 1. Bought these to replace my Audio-Technicas for when I'm at work. And I just wanted some higher-end IEM's. Although I have listened to the Sennheiser IE800 and those were some seriously incredible IEM's so they will be hard to beat. From what I'm reading though, the Pinnacle 1's are something special!

I'll have to include my sold headphones since I now only own one (sad I know) :)
 
Audeze open EL-8 (blows my mind every single time I listen to it, and is ultimately the reason I sold the rest, everything below pales in comparison)
Shure SRH-840 (best closed headphone I have heard, very neutral but a little bright, narrow soundstage, built terribly)
Bang & Olufsen H6 (great soundstage and treble but lacks lower mids which make it feel a bit hollow)
Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 over-ear (great bass and nice soundstage, reasonable mids but rolled off highs, lots of fun but lacks that crisp sound I love)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

How does one compare headphones with IEMs?
 
My DT880s are better than my DT770s. That's easy. But when comparing with my Fischer DBA-02 Mk2, I'm at a loss. It's a different sound, as the DBA-02s are more neutral, but in all other respects they are really extraordinary.  Better? I don't know.

Is it worth keeping HD-800 and HE-560 together? 
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1) Beyerdynamic T1 v2 My favorite in terms of soundstage, detail and comfort. Needs a powerful amp and is allergic to bad recordings.
 
2) Beyerdynamic T5p v2 (only about 30 hours on them so far). More forgiving than T1. Excellent comfort. Less impressive soundstage mainly due to closed design. Not a tight sealed design like Momentums. I prefer the T5p for that, it feels less claustrophobic. Despite being rated at 32 ohms, they require at least a portable amp to start shining.
 
3) Sennheiser HD598 Excellent price performance ratio. Quite bright and is not too far from Beyerdynamic signature.
 
4) Sennheiser HD555
 
5) Sennheiser HD231i

I found the sound quality of my new KSC75 very good. KSC75 is end game for people on a budget, everything after KSC75 is diminishing returns territory.

Honestly the FX-850s are so good I could live without any of the other headphones. Just need a good open set with good soundstage and imaging. Probably going to get the 800 soon. Seriously the 850s just blow everything else I've owned out of the water. Incredible for the price.
Recently purchased the th-x00s and AudioQuest Nighthawks and love both set equally. I'd say they're not quite at the level of the LCD2, but they're pretty close.
I also recently came upon a Final Audio Design - Piano Forte X-CC. This is a strange one because I've not found it to be very enjoyable at all. The way it fits in my ears is painful, so I may just have too small of ear canals to enjoy this one. I got it for $550 though, and it's originally a couple thousand dollars.

2.ТН-600 lovely bass which doesn't spoil low mids at all whatsoever, sound stage is great for (semi-)closed cans

4. DT-990 (250 Ohm) my first audiophile cans, I still have a soft spot for them, technically they have some flaws like a little bit fluffy bass, but God, I do love them :)
 
But the above is the rank by technical characteristics. 
As for the head time and the shear pleasure I get from them... they are equal, yes the are

Sorry, mix of headphones and iem's:
JH Audio J13v2
Shure SE535 w/Whiplash TWag silver/gold cable (with the cable they are close to J13's)
Westone UM Pro 50
HD650 w/Whiplash TWag cable
Of course, this list depends on a couple of things:
What kind of music - Westones, for example are best at Rock/Basshead. Shure's have best midrange
Where I am - much of my listening is in bed, where I can't really use the HD650's (great as they are).

I have owned momentum 1.0 over ears and they were very very very crisp and timbre'y ??
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I haven't listened to the 1.0s at any great length, but the 2.0 over-ears have treble, but they have no air (they are rolled off at probably around 14 kHz ish).  After you hear any pair of Audezes, you'll see exactly what is missing about any of the Momentums (and most all other headphones) straight away.

That's a bit of a broad sweeping statement.
Have you heard the EL-8 closed-back?  If anything, that's an example of an Audeze headphone that has quite a lot 'missing'.
LCD-XC isn't exactly a shining example either.

From my limited time getting in to this scene.
 
Logitech UE6000 (Really enjoyable all rounder)
Sony MDR 10RC (For their small price these are great bargain. Warm and full sounding, great for movies)
Senn Momentum 2.0 On Ear (Great sound but forgettable after a while. Still nice to go back to)
Senn HD25ii (First decent pair, like the Momentums, get boring after a while as bit too congested)
 
(Bottom of the list by far)
 
AKG k550 (Thin, lifeless, boring)

Oh man, it's been forever since I've done this. Here goes:
 
1. Beyerdynamic T5P V1 - My big-boy headphones. The 800 pound gorilla of the bunch. End game. These do... Just everything well. Such a spacious sound for a closed headphone, with a nice, airy sound. Overall they lean toward energetic and bright, but in no way harsh. Bass has nice thump, and extends low, but they certainly aren't bass monsters. They're just incredibly detailed, yet endlessly forgiving. You put crap quality through them, and gold comes out the other side. You put great sounding music through them, and an experience come out the other side! Just a treat to listen to every time I put them on.
 
2. Sony MDR-CD900ST - I've raved about these for years, and it still holds true: utterly amazing for the price. Borderline end-game. Somewhat lacking in bass extension, and maybe a little sterile at times, but still a joy to listen to.
 
3. Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80 - Owned these a while ago, loved them, gave them away, and have since gotten another pair. Probably the most nicely balanced bassy headphone out there. A little bit "V" shaped, but mids still get some love. Spacious sounding, comfortable, easy to drive, isolate well: these things just tick a lot of boxes.
 
4. AKG M220 - The newest addition to the crew. I had owned the K271s a while ago, but never bothered with the K240s until I saw these GORGEOUS white ones. Sound-wise you can tell they're in the same family as the K271s... But kind of opposite.  The K271s were just on the bright end of neutral, and these are more on the darker end. Nicer bass impact, better extension, and overall warmer presentation make them a keeper!
 
5. AKG K612 - Until the M220s these would be my #4, but I find myself somewhat fatigued by them with certain music, and the mids sound somewhat thinner than the M220s. And while their soundstage is slightly bigger, their imaging sounds like it's missing something in the center. Sound is either a dot in the center, or it's pushed all the way to the side. The M220s have more natural imaging, with a soundstage that's still quite large.
 
6. Koss Pro DJ 100 - These have been my go-to beater headphone for a while, as well as my go-to recommendation for people just jumping into the hobby. Sound-wise, they just do SO much right. Nice amount of bass, fantastic mids, and a sparkly yet not fatiguing treble range. Soundstage is somewhat large for a closed headphone, too. It's a shame their build quality is less than amazing, pads are pretty crappy, and they don't isolate super well.
 
7. Sony MDR-ZX700 - Sonically, I would place these below the KSC-75s, but these are another headphone that just does a lot right. Isolation is fantastic. Extremely comfortable. Build quality is great for a $40 headphone. Easy to drive, nice imaging, good overall tonal balance. Very, very good for movies and games. Upper mids/treble is extremely harsh for some music. I mean, really, really unpleasant. Listening to Bob Dylan is impossible on them for me, so that's a HUGE knock to them.
 
8. Koss KSC-75 - I don't think there's much I need to say? They're legendary for their price.

HiFiMan HE1000 - I was hesitant to put these first because the #2 headphones are technically better. And these do take a little effort. I can pick a half dozen amplifiers from my previous ownership list that did not qualify - Grace Design m9XX made the headphone sound piercing to my ears, Meier-Audio Corda Rock was a little wooly in the bass, Schiit Mjolnir was also just not my favorite pairing. Then there are the tubes that just don't work such as the DNA Sonett that made crackling sounds, Valhalla that cannot be impedance matched, or Valhalla 2 that just sounds thin. But even out of something as simple as a CEntrance DACport, this headphone sounds just fine. And out of a good setup, it sounds fine enough to be listened to for hours and hours without break. It is a detailed, clean headphone - it is also a pleasure to listen to. That is why is #1.
Sennheiser HD800S - they fixed the treble! I did not know the bass could also use a little help, but I like what I hear from both fixes. This is a spectacular headphone! It is not number one because it still is more sports car than convertible cruiser. When I put the top down on my Miata, that's the HE1000. With the top up, it is still a spectacular car, but it is not the place I want to spend as many hours of my time. That is more the HD800S. This is still an HD800, true and true, and a spectacular listen.
AKG K702 - so inexpensive to own. So dry and accurate. So comfortable and lightweight! I have no discomfort issues with #1 or #2, but this headphone is likely even more universally easy to fit. This headphone is also my scalpel, my tool for discerning if the change I just made was for the good. This is a really good headphone, not far behind the HD800S and these days a really great bargain!
Sennheiser HD650 - this was my first headphone, back from 2003. But my ranking here is for the 2015 version of this headphone. For someone who has been listening to the original for 12 years (like me), this newer edition is a dramatic departure. It is still a pleasure to listen to, similar to the HE1000 and similar to the original version of the HD650. But today, it is also offers a lot more detail retrieval. I don't know about the veil - this is a great overall headphone, and can be played through a number of systems that the above #1 - #3 headphones might not survive (well, the listener might not). It is a good balance of details and forgiveness.
Audeze EL-8C - yep, I still use these. But they require a clean, very clean amplifier source. I'll run this from a Chord Mojo. I'll run this from a Schiit Ragnarok. Alternatively, it requires a special tube amplifier. I was surprised just before I sold it, the DNA Sonett sounded excellent with this headphone. I will, someday, try this on the MicroZOTL2. But for now, it is hard for me to get past headphones #1 and #2.
Grado SR60i - bargain basement price! This is shockingly good with a low impedance tube amplifier. This also sounded good through the DNA Sonett. Similarly, it'll take a slow day for me to get past all the headphones above it to try this with MicroZOTL2. But I envision only good things there too!

Finally got some stuff back! All of these are modified, some more than others. All are being driven from a Geek Out 450.
 
1: Sansui SS-100:
 
Most transparent by far. Distorts a bit compared to the HE-6 (especially in the upper midrange) but cleaner, smoother, and far more natural sounding. My absolute favorite of anything I've ever tried, the midrange is truly something special and they maintain fantastic extension into both bass and treble. By far the best seductive characteristic of my gear; these are fantastic at sucking you into the music. Really comfy too, the headband cushioning is spot on despite being thin and they don't clamp at all -- they just kinda float there. I did have to switch them to over ear pads to achieve this though. Not very nice feeling stock. I love them, a lot, though not as much when it's loud in my room due to how open they are -- noise cuts through the bass like a knife and makes them sound thin. I usually turn the aquarium filter off when I use these. Not suitable for meets! 
 
2: HiFiMAN HE-6:
 
A one word descriptor for these would probably be "huge". The way this thing presents its sound is very... huge, I don't know how else to put it. The closest thing was listening to the speaker system in a small auditorium. Their bass is very punchy and these slam harder than anything I've ever heard if you give them the right material. However, they have a slight shelving of the treble and upper midrange -- about -8dB at 1kHz. I'm happier at around the 5dB mark. The imaging also doesn't seem as precise as the Sansui, but I'm still waiting on the speaker amp for these, so that will probably change. Headphones that need extra power have always sounded slightly "cloudy" to me -- likely a side effect of the source equipment not responding well to the load or not pushing enough juice for it. Though, the fact that they already sound as good as they do is very, uh, promising... and almost frightening. A side note, these were modded by someone else, so they're not necessarily entirely to my taste. This also means they use Audeze vegan earpads and the headband is slightly stretched out -- so even despite being the heaviest headphone I've ever held by far, these are still just as comfortable as the Sansui. Well, maybe the pads retain a little more heat...
 
3: Pioneer Monitor 10-II:
 
Absolutely my favorite closed headphone and the best I've heard thus far. They provide one of the most amazing bass presentations I've ever heard. According to my measurements, they actually distort less than the HE-6 in the bass and midrange -- yes, really!! The bass distortion is actually so low that it melds into the midrange perfectly and doesn't stand out at all. They also extend very well to bass and treble, which makes for a very complete listening experience. It is very very rare for a dynamic to do this so well! It's actually slightly above the HE-6 in this regard as of writing despite this being an area that planars excel at. They also get to listenable levels out of anything and they can take some serious cranking -- I've had these things up to 120dB and the bass never crapped out. Definitely one of the most unique headphones in my stable. Unfortunately, they are mostly reserved for monitoring and quiet listening, as they have a very sharp spike at 16kHz that rings violently when you turn them up loud. They also have a bizarre characteristic in the upper midrange -- they peak slightly at 1.5kHz (with some ringing) and take a 25dB nosedive into 4kHz. In most cases this is a measurement artifact, with some ringing showing up on the CSD immediately after the dip, but this is not present here. While there is still adequate treble to balance this out, I've heard them as simultaneously sounding slightly dull and shouty on many occasions. Did I mention they're comfy and provide great isolation? 
 
4: KOSS PRO/4AAA:
 
This beast is unique, the bass is hugely emphasized (almost +15dB) and thick but the midrange and treble, though pretty rough, stay flat and balanced throughout  with only the slightest rolloff at the last octave (16-20KHz). The bass can pound the hell out of your skull and they isolate amazingly well due to how the pads are designed -- I've successfully used these as hearing protection while mowing the lawn! While definitely not UNcomfortable for me, they are still the least comfortable headphone here, and they don't quite sound as balanced as the Pioneers; very slightly dark by comparison. They do still resolve well though, which (coupled with the isolation) is why I've held onto them for so long and will continue to do so. One of the more difficult to drive headphones here though; I've had these sound wonderful from one amp and awful from the next.
 
 
A couple permanent residents that don't see head time:
 
5: Pioneer SE-500:
 
This was the first headphone I bought with my own money and is in very, very rough shape. They were my favorite for a very long time; I always thought there was something "special" to how they sounded. They're modified and have a very nice, clean, lush midrange with bass roll off and good treble extension. Kind of like an electret in that they provide excellent midrange and transparency, but they can be driven from a normal headphone jack. Comfy. Less sensitive than the HE-6... so they're out of use for quite a while. Worth noting, even with the HE-6 and Sansui in the database, they possess the best transient response I've ever measured. So... yeah. 
 
6: BEYER DT48S (5 ohm):
 
These have an issue with one of the drivers that makes them cut in and out. They were also a gift from a close friend. These resolve far better than they should, honestly up to par with the Sansui in this regard, but the FR is extremely nasty and the distortion behaves oddly. Note: some people call the DT48 thin sounding, but they don't really sound that way to me as long as you get a good seal (which is extremely difficult, but whatever). These are also the only unmodified headphone on this list.
 


 
A note: I talked about measurements a lot didn't I? I'll get around to posting some of my squiggly lines soon so you guys can get a look. Right now I just need to find a suitable solution for doing square waves and I'll be good.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Ooh squiggly lines! Yes please!
I doubt I'll ever hear a Monitor 10-II but my RP18 and HE-500 should come pretty close to the SS-100 and HE-6 respectively, so it should be a close comparison. 
Even out of my FiiO E17 the HE-6 sounded stunning and eerily similar to the HE-500 (had to crank it up nearly to max output ) ... I mean, it was designed to be an 'easy to drive' HE-6 anyway.

HD 600 - DT 990 (Close tie. Not real preference; one is more neutral than the other.)
 
DT 770 (Slightly compromised DT 990, due to closed design.)
 
PX 100 ii (Surprisingly good for their size. Not sure they're up there with HD 600/650 as the famous thread by Katun claims. Need to A/B more.)
 
Audio Technica M40x (A neutral version of the popular M50x)
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

beyerdynamic T 51 i: very good for classical and choral pieces, sometimes they get hot and not actually that comfortable (ears get red after wearing for over an hour).* The cable will likely break eventually and you have to send them in for service. Poor design. 
 
Sennheiser PX100-ii: a smooth, warm sound, easy to listen to, but a bit "small" sounding due to their size. I think the treble extension kind of sucks with these. 
 
Sony MDR-V6: great for analyzing music, strong sound, harsh on the upper end with some music, a bit thin sounding overall. They can sound very harsh when first put on after using darker phones, but your ears can get used to it.
 
Grado SR60i: also a bit thin sounding, light in bass, but when it finds the right music these sound amazing. great headstage (better than px100-ii or portapro)
 
Koss PortaPro: sometimes these sound great, and they fit a bit more comfortably on my ears than the Sennheiser, but they're not as full sounding - somewhere in the upper treble there is like a hole in the sound. Maybe I have a bad pair. The dynamics (fun sound) of these easily beats the Sennheisers, which sounds too controlled. Like the difference between wearing a tank top and a buttoned up polo shirt. 
 
Sony MDR-ZX300: pretty strong sound for $30. It actually seems to have a wider, less congested headspace than T51i. But overall sound is just light and "fun," nothing serious.
 
Sony MDR-EX110AP: surprisingly good sounding for their cheap price. A lot of music comes through crystal clear with them. But they still have a small, in-your-head sound typical of earbuds. Also the treble is too frosty. I prefer the duller sound of a previous cheap model (EX10IP), which got even worse Amazon reviews. 
 
Sony MDR-ZX110AP: did not like these. The ZX100 had a lighter, crisper sound. These have added bass and sound muffled by comparison. But maybe possible to get used to it over time. 
 
Panasonic RP-HT21: a basic, popular $5 headphone on Amazon. Has a nice long cord for such a cheap price. The cord is less annoying than the one on the $300 beyerdynamic. This provides good sound for such a cheap price, but I guess it's what you'd expect. has a bit of an artificial bass bump that weakens over time. Band is prone to breaking where it adjusts, but I've taped them and used them for listening to documentaries while falling asleep. More comfortable than all the other pairs I have too. 
 
 
*Not sure what I was thinking here -- must have been testing too many headphones the night it happened. These are probably about as comfortable as on-ears get and the leather-like padding feels very soft on the ears..

I did not rank my PS1000 as I've had it in storage for a while now, hadn't bothered to take it out....but will prolly get around to adding it to my can rotation in the near future.

As a 400i owner, I'm curious ... What do the Audeze offer that the 400i don't? And what do you like about the el-8, in particular - I've read so many negative reviews of those cans (closed version), I'm interested to hear some positive comments 
 
Cheers
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


A lot of the negative reviews about the EL-8 come from the first revision of it, that was changed in 2016. I have the open, and theyre simply the best ive heard so far. I have a HE-400, build quality, and sound just dont match the EL-8o, not even close. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I use to own the 400's and moved to the 400i's and to me even though the 400i's have a more mature sound they lack in the low end compared to the 400's. This is why I like the el-8's they have more low end and seem to have more detail in the mids and highs to me, you just lose some of the soundstage.

I think most of the negativity is aimed at the closed-back version which isn't in the same league as the open-back.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Right. My original question was about the closed back listed in the OP's rankings. One of the few times I've seen the closed el8 mentioned favorably. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

With the closed back planars ive heard, planars imo just do better with a open design. These 100mm big boys need room to breathe imo. But im no acoustic engineer. Then again look at the raves over how good the Sines are, maybe just not enough dampening for the el8c. The 2016 refresh though may have corrected that. I know one thing so far the el8o is my favorite phone. I havnt found a type of music that sounds bad on these yet. Exception being poor recordings, these things will find every defect.Edited by droido256 - 5/5/16 at 11:10am .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

been a while since I jumped on this, so:
1) HiFiMan HE400i - not a perfect headphone, but a perfect headphone for me.  Easy to drive, energetic, great imaging accuracy, great bass, fast
2) Fostex THX00 - Listen to this the most, due to it being my work headphone.  Just an incredible bassy headphone, without making any of the compromises that most basshead headphones make.
3) Shure SRH840 - My closed at home headphone.  Nice solid fun warm signature, while also having very present upper mids/lower treble.  Great isolation and built like a tank.
4) E-MU Walnut - Great "straight out of an iphone" walk arounder.  Fun bass, clear, smooth mids and highs.  What I take with me when I travel
5) Innateck woody IEMS - I don't even know the model name for these, but I love them.  I'll one day put a post up here about them, but I paid $10 for them and they're my go to for walking the dog.
6) Koss KSC75 - These stay in my messenger bag at all times so that I have something if I end up with some time to burn.  Beat many a $100 cans.  
7) Audio Technica AD700 - go to open "watching a movie" cans.  Also still up there with the best headphones I have for classical.
8) SR80e - Nice "doing chores around the house" headphone.  Great to just throw some classic rock on and non-critically listen with.  
9) Sennheiser HD439 - my go to cans for watching netflix in bed while my girlfriend is sleeping.  They're solid performers and very light and comfortable.

I change my mind all the time -- frankly, it's generally what's on my head that's my favorite, because my brain adjusts to the different signature and appreciates the strengths of the cans on my head, then if for some reason I'm craving a different flavor, the "other" cans are better and I pull them out... but here is my current ranking:
 
1. Fostex T50RP Mk3 with stock pads (no mods!) (my first planars, love the precision, the fast planar bass, and mids are right there, love it, don't know all the right words -- just love them)
2. Beyerdynamic DT 880 Pro 250 Ohm  (so comfortable! love the highs that some people don't on these, bass is just right)
3. Alessandro MS2i (Grado with aggression toned down some - very enjoyable and what I'm listening to right now)
4. Sennheiser HD 600 (these go to number 1 when I have them own -- sorry I'm flaky! they don't do anything wrong to my ears - just sometimes I want something different)
5. HiFiMAN HE-400 (when I want fully open planar heaven, and I strangely don't find them heavy at all)
 
The Oppo PM-3, Grado SR325e, and AKG K7XX go in there somewhere but I've barely listened to the first two for less than an hour and a half since I just got them, and the K7XX is on loan to a co-worker after I briefly enjoyed them, but I remember thinking it was definitely the king of soundstage in my headphone stable.

2. HE-6 modded
3. PM2 modded
4. Z7 modded (just sold)

Blackwood is on its way but since I've heard it before I'd probably rank it about third and move the PM2 down. I also just bought a UERM (second time) because I realized I don't have any good IEMs anymore.

1) HE-400i: Safe pick no matter what the music genre. I just can't go wrong when putting these babies on, hence why they get #1.
2) TH-X00: Just a wonderful, fun headphone to listen to. Great compliment to the 400i's neutral-ish tone.
3) XBA-H3: What can I say? Had these for over two years, now. I love a fun, u-shaped sound signature on the go.
4) SHP9500: My all time favorite gaming headphone. Cheap, durable, sounding well above its price range. If ranked by usage time, these would be #1. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I've noticed over the last few months from the 400i and X00 threads that we have very similar tastes. I'm now looking into the E-MU walnut since it seems to be to your liking, as well.
Man, does Shure hold a dear spot in my heart. One of my favs is the 1540. Sort of like a better refined 840 with a wider soundstage and more bass. Loved them both very much during their respective times in my possession.

That's a very interesting ranking. What makes you put the HD800 so low, and what do you prefer about the LCD-X and LCD-2R2 that the LCD-3 doesn't have?
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1.) DT990 Pro (My ears absolutely love the treble and air on these, I know some people can't take the treble but these are my clear number 1. I love my female voices so the definitely suit female voices such as Lauren Mayberry from CHVRCHES and Grimes)
 
2) HD600 (Just the good allrounder)
 
3) Fostex T50RP mk3 w Stock Pads (Incredible value for a planar. Stock pads are uncomfortable but the stock sound is incredible for the price. Will be getting the Shure 1540 pads but worry about what it will do to the sound)
 
4) Grado Sr80e (Just a fun fun headphone. Those Grado Mids are addictive)
 
5) Philips Fidelio X2 (Don't really have a need for these now that i got the DT990s. Will probably sell them soon)
 
6) V-Moda M100 w XL pads (My bassy fun portables)
 
7) Audio Technica MSR7 (My bright fun portables)
 
8) Audio Technica Pro700mk2 w HM5 Pads (Awesome Basshead headphone)
 
Will add the Fostex TH-X000 soon after the current drop finishes and hope to get them late June, so i will update my list when it comes. Hoping it is up there near the top considering it will be the most expensive headphones i will own.

Everyone is also ranking their headphones here very differently.
There are other factors, not just the headphones objective technical ability. (comfort, enjoyment, aesthetics)
 
If i owned an LCDX I would rank it low too, because the return you get on that purchase is terrible.
You pay so much more for very little gains and a neck workout.  
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I'm with you in general in reference to open vs closed, but the TH900 are the exception. They sound like an open back. For a closed back, they leak sound like crazy. I believe it's their choice of wood they use that lets this happen and also contributes to their large soundstage and colorful sound.Edited by Hifi59 - 6/25/16 at 5:17am 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



Agreed, theres something special about the TH900. I had the TH900 and LCD-3F together for a long time. I found myself reaching for the TH900 much more often. It definitely isn't as technically perfect as the LCD-3f. But, for just relaxing and listening to music (at least the way I listen to music) it's currently my favorite headphone. I have a set of Edition X's showing up in the next couple of days and hope they are more pleasing to me than the LCD-3f was.

This thread was an interesting read. Two things stuck out to me. Very few people put the HD 800 series on the top of the list, headphones that are ridiculously idolized on those threads. Alot of people ranked HifiMan very highly.
 
My list.
 
1. Audeze LCD-X. My go-to headphones for all genres. Plus: highly efficient at 20 ohms. Extremely forgiving headphones and make everything sound great. Very open soundstage though not as open as the HD 800's. Minus: Yea these are some heavy bastards.
2. Fostex TH900 Lawton Audio mod with Gaboon ebony wood earcups. The. Best. Bass. Use them for my favorite genre and all sub-genres in electronica. Lawton mod eliminates the U-shaped frequency response with receded mids and brings female vocals forward.
3. Sennheiser HD 800. Yup. Like these better than the HD 800 S's which pisses a lot of people off when you argue the point. Minus: Piercing treble. Ouch. Plus: Soundstage, detail and no bass distortion.
4. Sennheiser HD 800 S. Tames the treble, deeper bass but with distortion. Soundstage and detail not quite there compared to the original.
5. NAD Viso HP50. My travel cans. Best sound for the buck and portable.
6. Sennheiser Momentum v2 AEBT. My commuting and air travel cans.
 
So yea when I travel I bring both the NAD's and the Momentum's with me. The Momentum's get me to my destination. Then when I'm there, I enjoy music and movies on the NAD's.
 
I actually only use the LCD-X's and the modded TH900's for music at home. Use the original 800's for TV, movies (cable, Netfilx) and console gaming. Use the 800 S when watching blu-rays so that the treble in the lossless audio doesn't blow my ears out and give me tinnitus which the original HD 800's will do.
 
If you consider comfort, the HD 800's are the best. I wear them for hours and hours without any discomfort. Can't say that about any other headphone.

AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

1: HiFiMAN HE-6 (mods): Absolutely decimates everything below it in technical prowess and accuracy -- and I do mean decimates it. A little rough and unpleasant in the treble, otherwise very smooth. Relatively neutral, maybe slightly dark. Extremely large and heavy, but comfortable with the new earpads.
2: Sansui SS-100 (mods): Buttery smooth and immersive. Intimate and flat from bass to treble. Presents sound in a 2-dimensional, yet very well separated manner. Very coherent, natural timbre and texture. A little bit soft on the resolution compared to HE-6, but cleaner. These are my go-to as I can listen to them literally all day with no fatigue or comfort issues. They're also quite a bit more transparent; less about accuracy, more about the music. Worth noting: these are still a very clear step above mid-fi offerings like the HD650. Kind of like a sweet spot between summit-fi and mid-fi. Perhaps... hi-fi? :OOO
3: Pioneer Monitor 10-II (mods): Best closed headphone, bar none. Sounds like an open headphone while having tighter, deeper bass than either the Sansui or HE-6... and anything else I've heard for that matter. Easily as resolving as the HE-6 but less coherent. FR is a bit wonky above 1kHz but not unlistenable. Enclosure problems hold this headphone back quite a bit; these will see more work in the future and could ascend higher. That being said I do use the others more since isolation usually hinders rather than helps me.

Slap on some Denon 2000/5000/7000 replacement earpads onto those NADs. (even the half-decent cheap chinese knock-offs will do)
You won't regret it.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


It's mainly cause the RP18s are a little too small for my head and not the pads, unfortunately!
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


That wasn't just me, then. I had to use the stock headband at max size with bigger pads. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Same here... the headband is tiny.
The larger the ear pads you put on will by extension make the headband larger too.
 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX



I couldn't wear them for longer than 5 minutes as a result. Tak's TH-600 headband idea is very captivating though...
 

 
   
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX


Yes, yes, and more yes. These pads sound insane on the RP18. If the stock headband wasn't ****, I'dve just slapped these pads on over the stock pads and been done with it. 
  
AABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXXAABBCCDDEEZZXX

Well, this is somewhat amplifier dependent, so I'm just averaging my rankings at an overall level across the different amps used.  Some are better with one amp or another and wanted to account for that factor.
 
Here we go:
 
1. Beyerdynamic T1 (cube mod)
2. Beyerdynamic DT-880/600
3. Sennheiser HD-424 (just love this vintage can, so clear!)
4. Sennheiser HD-600
5. Audio-Technica ATH-M50xbl (my "go-to" portable can)
6. Sennheiser HD-420 (a bit too bass heavy for my taste)
7. AKG-240 Studio
 
 
I know Beyers are a love/hate thing for the Head-Fi crowd, but I'm one that loves that sound.  The T1 was a bit hot in the treble for sure before the cube mod.  I played around with materials and shapes until the sound was optimized to my ears.  The HD-424 is a surprise to many people that have a listen.  It looks old fashioned and funky, but through the Woo WA2 it's magic.  It's a 2,000 ohm pair of phones (no, that's not a misprint), so a smartphone or low power amp isn't going to bring these to life.  With the proper power though, they are still a joy to listen to after all these years!

Just finished mods on the mylar NADs after weeks (if not months) of sitting in a box. They strike a pleasing middle ground between the Sansui (tonality) and HE-6 (accuracy) that is so far very addicting. Its also more comfortable than either as it's using pads and a headband from a Fostex TH600. I'm really excited to go into more detail on this headphone but alas, it is 5:30 in the morning and my phone is dead as a doornail. Time for bed.

1. Sennheiser HD 650 modded
2. Sennheiser HD 800
 
 
Just received my HD 800 today. I prefer the modded HD 650. Going to put in the super dupont resonator into the HD 800 when I get it, maybe it will change the ranking.
 
HD 650 sounds more natural.
HD 650 has fuller bass, more tube like bass.
HD 800 treble feels detailed but it's sharp, the HD 650 has smoother softer treble.

How have you modded your 650?

Removed the spider in the back, and applied Dynamat in select areas.
 
I also have a big hole on the inner foams.

I don't own that many so this will be a short list:
 
Hifiman HE-400S: superb detail and imaging, wide soundstage, deep bass that's a bit boomy with stock pads ( but much better with Focus pads A ), mids a bit recessed and highs slightly rolled off, laid back sound signature, unimpressive build quality. Headband really comfortable but pads have a large contact area. Extremely good with Jazz music.
Sennheiser HD 595: sweet mid-range, nice soundstage, solid build quality and great comfort for the price, pads really comfortable but headband slightly less. Highs not super detailed, more forward sounding than the Hifiman HE-400S. Very strong with vocals. Good over-all headphone, does well with most modern music. 
Grado SR-80: terrible build quality, stock pads and headband very uncomfortable ( I've changed mine ), but sound quality makes up for it. Forward sound with little bass, mid range is very detailed and energetic. Works extremely well with classic rock music. 
V-Moda M80: built like a tank, nice case, good portability and durability, can sound is a bit uninspired. Small soundstage, sound a bit dark and uninvolving. Sounds good with most music but doesn't excel at any particular genre. I enjoy discovering new music more with my other headphones. 
 
My ideal headphone: mid range and comfort of HD595 + soundstage, detail and clarity of HE-400S + energy of SR-80 + build quality of M80 = ...  
 
Any suggestions what my next purchase should be ?
