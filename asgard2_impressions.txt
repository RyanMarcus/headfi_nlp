As of 2/7/13:
 
STATUS: In production. Orders placed now are expected to ship in 5-7 business days.
//MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 is the next generation of one of the most popular headphone amps in the world, boasting higher performance and convenience features such as switchable gain and preamp outputs. It’s a versatile control center for your desktop system, ideal for most headphones from IEMs to orthos, and with pre outs for powered desktop speakers.
Significantly Improved Performance
We used what we learned in //MARK\\Mjolnir to significantly improve //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2’s performance. A high-voltage, cascoded JFET gain stage feeds a high-current Class A MOSFET output section. The 80V rails on the gain stage allow us to reduce distortion, while retaining //MARK\\Asgard’s no-overall-feedback design in high-gain mode.
Additional Versatility: From IEMs to Orthos to Active Monitors
Asgard 2 offers two gain settings. The low-gain mode is perfect for high-sensitivity IEMs, while the high-gain mode is ideal for most other headphones, up to and including many orthodynamics. In addition, the preamp outputs can easily be connected to powered speakers, for a complete desktop system.
Made in USA
By “made in USA,” we mean made in USA. The vast majority of the total production cost of //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our board house is 20 minutes away from our office in Newhall. Our chassis guys are just over the hill in the Valley.
5-Year Warranty
//MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 is covered by a limited warranty that covers parts and labor for five years. That’s 5 years. Yes. FIVE. Which is up to 5X that of our competition, if you weren’t so hot at math. Note the marketing weasel-wording “up to.”
15-Day Satisfaction Guarantee
Try //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 in your own house for 15 days. If you don’t like it, simply send it back for a refund, minus a 5% transaction fee. Try spending 15 days in an audio store. They’ll kick you out. Unless you buy them donuts. Maybe.

Long story short, after a relatively sleep-deprived weekend, we've resolved the problems (a combination of some parts substitutions that had some unexpected effects, bad grounding through the chassis--the new anodizing is really tough--and a couple of different procedures at the PCB assembly house), we're good. 
 
//MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2s will ship on Monday in limited quantities, followed throughout the week with more and more as we come up to speed. I still expect most backorders to be cleared by the end of this week.
 
Someday I'm gonna make a Monopoly-style board game called "The Path to Production, AKA 'U R Boned!'"
 
Apologies again for the delay.
 
All the best,

You know, Schiit provides more info than plenty of other manufacturers (though not as much as I'd like, but nobody does), and I like the gain switch and all, but... just to be that guy...
 
omg first Schiit used an op amp for the output of the //MARK\\Modi, and now they're using global (? or what is the interpretation of "overall" otherwise?) feedback, at least for the low gain!  omg head explode.  But I thought they said they liked using ___ and ____, and talked up how product X and Y and Z were so awesome because ___ and not using ___.  Okay, seriously, it's well-established that low-moderate amounts of feedback, like 12 dB or so, often can reduce overall distortion, but increase higher-order distortion.  Isn't this the crux of the argument against feedback?—whereupon others note that with topologies where you can get much higher levels of feedback, all distortion including higher-order are lower.  And then you run in circles in arguments around the whole meter-reader ideology thing.
 
Anyway, the point is that the low-gain mode is tainted by the devil hisself!
 
Okay, to be fair, distortion levels prior to feedback are probably fairly but not astronomically low to begin with, so any crud added in higher harmonics should be very low, probably no real concern at all.  I mean, I hope so, considering how much power is being used for that class A biasing.

Gotcha.
 
Bottom line, horses for courses. There is no one single answer for every audio design question, and there are no *absolutely right* answers. There are only choices.
 
For example, for I/V conversion, the example I like to use is a discrete low-impedance amplifier stage with input at the emitters (or sources, pick your poison) vs the most mondo badass op-amp on the planet. The discrete stage (with feedback or error-correction to lower the input impedance even further) will stomp the op-amp into the ground, any way you want to measure. The DAC will be happier, because it's seeing the closest thing to a dead short it can see. Of course, we're not currently using current-out DACs, so this is a bit of a canard. 
 
Personally, I like the freedom to design that comes with headphone amps. For most headphone loads that don't require much power, we can use highly inefficient Class-A topologies, tubes, and lots of other things that aren't gonna fly in a speaker amp. Speaker amps are fundamentally more constrained, because you're focused on converting power efficiently and managing power supply modulation, and you're a lot less worried about absolute noise performance. Which means a whole lot of different choices. 
 
And you shouldn't be surprised to see us use a lot of different answers in our designs. For //MARK\\Magni, where efficiency is important, we chose a pretty classic Class AB topology with global feedback. For //MARK\\Modi, an op-amp. For //MARK\\Bifrost and //MARK\\Gungnir, overall-feedback discrete designs. For //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2, a very elaborate, high-voltage power supply, combined with a cascode and class-A MOSFET output. For //MARK\\Valhalla, all tubes (with their inherent limitations), for //MARK\\Lyr, a tube hybrid with a dynamically adjusting output stage, so it could put out a lot more power than //MARK\\Asgard without melting. For //MARK\\Mjolnir, a circlotron-style output stage that eliminates the need to match N and P-channel MOSFETs and dramatically reduces the number of parts you need for a balanced design--at the cost of balanced-only. In the future, when we start moving into speaker amps, you're going to find both some radical approaches, and some more traditional ones, usually based on the target price.
 
Are any of these the right choices? That depends on your point of view, and what you're looking for. In the end, if you're looking for made-in-USA, inexpensive products from an iconoclastic company with a sense of humor, then, well, the choice is pretty clear.

SO, I was asked to also put his here, merged a couple other post into this one
Bare with me here as I dont write these things for a living or anything...
 
Just unboxed mine. It was delivered at 1 pm it is 4:15pm and the case is still cold from beign inthe truck. Must have been frozen in the truck/plane to still be this cold three plus hours later.
No blemishes that I can see, volume pot is smooth motion. Once it warms up a bit more I will give it a good listen with //MARK\\HD650's, //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500's, //MARK\\SR325i's and reprot back. I will be using my //MARK\\Modi as the DAC.
 
Ok, so first and second impressions were not so good. I plugged in the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 and let it warm up for 15 minutes or so. Then hooked up the //MARK\\HD650 and got muffled sound and distortion in the left channel at all levels. The //MARK\\Asgard was only warm on one side (right side near the headphone jack). So I figured I better wait till was good and warm. 45 minutes later it seemed to be warming up nicely. Plugged the //MARK\\HD650 back in and same thing (muffled and distorted).
Let the troubleshooting begin. First thing I did was unplug the USB cable fromt he laptop and replug it in. BANG it fix the problem. Not sure what the cause was but it works now. Might have been an initialization issue with USB on the //MARK\\Modi?
 
So, on with the third impressions. It seems to take a long time to get hot n ready for action, about an hour and fifteen minutes? Maybe it was still frozen on the inside? 
I used a soundtrack from Eureka Seven with some tracks I am very familiar with to test. HalCali - Tip Taps Tip, Flow - Days, and Denki Groove - Niji. I listened at an elevated level to analyze the sound, higher than I would normally listen to for long periods.
 
This is comparing the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 to the //MARK\\Magni using the //MARK\\Modi as DAC from an MX11 laptop, Foobar Flac.
 
Can hear a hum when my ear is about five inches fromteh amp. But it is not noticable whith phones on.
 
//MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 (cause I know you want to see this first)
The //MARK\\Magni drives these phone OK but seemed to be lacking detail and low end punch. Still sound good, though. Just not quite there.
With //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 the phones prefered the high gain setting. Seemed to get better separation and more punch. Opened up the soundstage a little more. There was more definition and detail. Bass was very good crisp where needed. Mids cleared up some. Highs were more pronounced (could hear a hisssss when "ss" were sung). Like it was maybe a litle bright, but not bad. Definitely felt more lively withthe Asgard 2.
On low gain volume pot needed to be at ~2 o'clock, high gain it was at ~11:30 to 12.
 
//MARK\\HD650
With the //MARK\\Magni It seemed like there was someting between me and the music. I have heard others say veil, or like there was a towel over a speaker that masks the sound. It wasn't quite that bad but it was just lacking energy?
The //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 cleared most of that away in high gain. It made them wider (soundstage) and deeper and higher. I can hear the separation much better. Gives the bass more energy and clearity (not as punchy as the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 but a good improvement non the less). Again there was a hiss when 'ss' were sung. Maybe a little more pointed that the //MARK\\HE500's but still not bad. Mids are fuller and more distinct.
Volume pot was at ~12 noon only high gain for these phones.
 
//MARK\\SR325i (G-cush and T-shirt mod)
The //MARK\\Magni does not really like these phones, withthe G-cush alone they are way to bright and shrill, peircing and painful for some songs. The T-shirt mod under the G-cush tames that so they are tolerable but I don't typiclly use the //MARK\\Magni with these due to this issue.
I was expecting similar results with the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2, but that's not the case. The //MARK\\Asgard drives these phones just fine (with the mods). Wide soundstage, good mids and highs, but the bass is not there. The other two phones above are quite a bit more full than these phones. The Grados sound much better with my modded x-fi in my main computer rig and that's probably where they are going to stay.
 
So, overall the //MARK\\Asgard is a good step up from the //MARK\\Magni, as I would expect it to be. Next I think I will get a //MARK\\Bifrost and see how that changes things.
Hope this helps some of you fence riders jump in this Schiit pile with us...
 
 
Here are some photos to compare the finish to what was on the //MARK\\Magni///MARK\\Modi

***Reposting from the A2 Announcement thread***
 
 
Just received my //MARK\\A2 a few hours ago; serial number is still below 200.
 
While I was following this thread for quite a while, after opening a box and quick listen I felt compeled to register and share as there is definitely something to say. 
 
//MARK\\A2 replaced my beloved //MARK\\Musical //MARK\\Fidelity //MARK\\V-//MARK\\CAN //MARK\\II in one of my systems (//MARK\\Musical //MARK\\Fidelity //MARK\\V-//MARK\\DAC //MARK\\II///MARK\\V-//MARK\\PSU //MARK\\II///MARK\\AudioQuest //MARK\\Cinnamon //MARK\\USB///MARK\\Golden //MARK\\Gate //MARK\\RCA///MARK\\Audirvana //MARK\\Plus), and first time I heard //MARK\\A2 I was pleasantly shocked on how good it sounded with //MARK\\Beyerdynamic //MARK\\DT990/600 Ohms! 
 
Sound was very clean, balanced, and neutral; it was slightly darker than //MARK\\V-//MARK\\CAN //MARK\\II - and this seemed to work fine with //MARK\\DT990. //MARK\\A2 managed to reproduce low level details with great precision (especially highs). Also, low frequencies were much better controlled with no boominess nor distortions (//MARK\\V-//MARK\\CAN //MARK\\II sometimes cannot handle these correctly).
 
I also quickly pulled //MARK\\Beyerdynamic //MARK\\T90 (only 120+ hours) from my other system (//MARK\\Arcam //MARK\\rDAC///MARK\\Musical //MARK\\Fidelity //MARK\\M1HPA///MARK\\AudioQuest //MARK\\Cinnamon //MARK\\USB///MARK\\AudioQuest //MARK\\Big //MARK\\Sur //MARK\\RCA///MARK\\Audirvana //MARK\\Plus) but intresting enough //MARK\\T90 sounded not very good with //MARK\\A2 ((dark with slight hint of muddiness; I almost preferred DT990 sound here). Usually //MARK\\T90  sounds very accurate, much brighter, and more open with //MARK\\M1HPA. But again, having only 120 hours is way low for any critical listening so I would take this with a grain of salt.
 
Transformer hum. Compared to all of my other equipment that is dead silent, //MARK\\A2 does have some mechanical hum, although it is not loud by any means. Sitting next to MacBook Pro, Mac's noise almost overshadows its hum. If I put my ear next to it (1/2 foot or less), I can definitely hear it.
 
Also, mine had much stronger hum when it was cold (right out of the box, 45F or so), which kind of scared me a bit, but after warming up to room temperature it was less noticeable. After 10 min of use the temperature went up much more, which made most of the hum gone.

=============================================

Received my //MARK\\A2 today and was beyond excited to unbox it and hook it up to my computer. I also use the //MARK\\Schiit //MARK\\Modi as my DAC and love that little guy, really opens up my music and brings detail.
 
First impression - I use //MARK\\Shure //MARK\\SRH840 and //MARK\\Beyerdynamic //MARK\\Dt //MARK\\770 pro 80 
 
Bass-
Loving it... Seriously so smooth, deep, and boomy. It pairs so well with my //MARK\\Dt770's which is awesome cause my previous amp (//MARK\\Fiio //MARK\\E9) couldnt hang well and didnt have the impact that i was wanting with my beyerdynamics. As with the Shures, they are not bass heavy by any means, but still they pair well. The Bass is deep and while listening to "I want you back - Jackson 5" I really really enjoyed the bass guitar and the notes just hit so nicely
 
Mids - brings out the mids on my //MARK\\Dt770 which with the Fiio they felt pretty recessed and with vocal heavy songs i much preferred the shures over the //MARK\\dt770's but now i will have to see with more testing. The mids are clear and detailed with an open feeling.
 
Treble - right away i felt that //MARK\\A2 was a little bright and had to turn down the volume sometimes with higher pitched vocalist but i think that will  smooth out with some burn in from the //MARK\\A2. I enjoy the trebles and to be quite honest i dont really have a good treble heavy phones that can help me really test the treble. 
 
Last thoughts - i absolutely love it and i am glad i pulled the trigger to get a Schiit amp, i was so happy with the DAC that i thought the amp would just be as good of quality. I will try to update a little more if i feel like the burn in brings about some change. Over all very happy with my purchase and my hopes is that it will power my future headphones just as well as what i have now. 
 
Please lemme know your thoughts on what pair nicely with the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 as I am in the market for a good open-back headphone

=============================================

Hooked up my //MARK\\A2 last night. I'm not as seasoned as 99% of the folks here probably. I've owned my //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400s and an //MARK\\E17 for a little over a month now. That's about the same amount of time I had the //MARK\\Asgard (A1) on order. My primary use is a little different than most since I watch more movies with a little music here and there. I'm also DAC-less and essentially "double-amping" with my receiver. I'm using J River MC for playback.
 
While I haven't really been able to sit down and listen to the //MARK\\A2 for an extended period of time (or watch a whole movie on it), my initial impressions are that it hasn't added much over the //MARK\\E17. Again, it may be my inexperienced ears or the way I have things wired up but I've yet to discern much of a difference. That said, in spite of my double-amp'd setup, I've been quite impressed with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\400s and the //MARK\\E17 over the last month. It sounds really, really good and therefore, so does the //MARK\\A2. I don't know what adding a DAC to the mix and running directly from my soundcard to that would buy me but I'm guessing not a whole lot.
 
I may keep the //MARK\\A2 just because I'm fond of having a non-portable amp always there and plugged in (and hey, it looks really nice with my other components). I just haven't been blown away by it with my setup and compared to the //MARK\\E17 (which I had EQd to +2-4 bass).
 
One thing that I'm really trying to "get right" is the volume control. I basically have 3 controls with my setup: J River/Soundcard, AV Receiver, Headphone Amp. My thoughts are: turn up J River to the point where it shows no clipping for most things in software, turn the //MARK\\A2 all the way up and then turn my Receiver down to a listenable level (which should reduce any double-amp induced noise, yea?)
 
I prefer the low-gain setting on the //MARK\\A2 also. There's too much noise with my setup, otherwise.

** Reposted from Asgard 2 Announcement**
 
The delivery man dropped off my //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 a few hours ago. I'm listening to it now with my //MARK\\Grado //MARK\\RS-//MARK\\1s. Sounds really good. I've been using the //MARK\\Grado //MARK\\RA-//MARK\\1 for amplification, so no comparison.
 
The big difference I hear is the bass is so tight. It really thumps. Highs are crystal clear. However, I'm not one to judge as I'm 73 years old, and don't hear much above 10khz. What I do hear, sounds very good. No blemishes on the case or knob. I notice a very low level of 60hz hum if I have my ear close to the amp, but no hum through the headphones with the gain all the way up, and the amp set on high gain. Speaking of gain, I have the gain knob up pretty high with the //MARK\\RS-//MARK\\1s (32 ohm)-about 1 o'clock for moderate volume-2 o'clock for loud. These all depend on input levels, so don't go by me, YMMV.
 
When I connected my //MARK\\Beyerdynamic //MARK\\DT-//MARK\\880 //MARK\\Pros (250 ohms), I had to crank the gain up a little more, but there was still plenty of gain left.
 
The amp is nice and warm to the touch, not too bad for a class A amplifier. I worked on Delco car radios, that went into General Motors autos, when I was a young man. They used class A amplifiers (DS-501 transistors), and they would almost burn you if you put your hand on the output stage heat sinks! The //MARK\\Asgard is cool by comparison. :)

Got my //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 in today along with my //MARK\\Modi.
Haven't had a TON of time to listen to it since I gotta go to school, but my initial impressions with my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s are wow this thing sound good. Very excellent fullness of sound in the high gain mode, and very responsive punchy bass that does not linger. For vocal tracks I can really hear the breathyness, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s are known for sometimes not having the imaging properties of cans like the //MARK\\HD800s, but it just sounds so warm I really enjoy it. Some songs I've listened to are: Eric Clapton Teardrops in Heaven from Unplugged, Deadmau5 The Veldt, Knife Party Bonfire, Josh Groban Oceano, and Alison Krauss Paper Airplane, and they all sound great through this amp/dac combo. Looking forward to spending some more time listening to it soon!
 
There is only one little problem I have and it's with OSX, when I use the //MARK\\Modi as my output I do not have control over the volume with the volume keys since it locks it at full. Does anyone have a workaround for this?

Topic: 9214196 in thread 650092
=============================================

IMHO, no, its sound is not even close to be warm (but the amp itself is ).
 
Regarding cold and analytical, let me give you a few observations and you decide for yourself.
 
1. It is very accurate and has outstanding resolution, including low level details and especially at high frequencies. 
 
2. It is also very transparent and airy in a way that brings a lot of tracks literally to life; you can almost feel it (and where other amps would feel like something is missing - yes, those very quiet, almost silent details).
 
My personal high level interpretation of "cold and analytical" is lifeless, boring sound. No, A2 is very far from that.
 
Also, if you like //MARK\\Q701, my guess is you might like //MARK\\A2. Funny thing is when I heard //MARK\\A2 first time, I thought it made my //MARK\\DT990/600 sound a bit like //MARK\\Q701 (which is almost like saying that apples when processed through //MARK\\A2 tasted like oranges).

I received my //MARK\\A2 a couple of days ago. I've noticed that it picks up a lot of static from my //MARK\\X-//MARK\\Fi sound card source. The static scales with the amp volume level, but *not* with the PC volume level. The sound is very audible during quiet passages of music. I don't hear the same static when using my //MARK\\MF //MARK\\X-//MARK\\Can //MARK\\V3 with the same source. I do not however hear the static if I use say my iphone as a source, so I know its not being generated in the amp, *but* somehow the other amp does not pick it up. I'm sure that a PC-based sound source is not going to be the cleanest, but if my other amp was not having an issue, I'd be less worried about it. Having said that, it almost makes the amp unusable in this setup. Note, I've also tried different audio cables without any benefit. As another side note, if I just touch the 3.5mm jack of the cable (i.e. my finger is the audio source), I get a lot of static coming from the amp. Its much less pronounced when I use the low gain setting (which is not practical for my //MARK\\HD-//MARK\\650s)

Been listening to my //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 for the past four days now.  Some initial impressions:
 
My unit definitely has some mechanical transformer buzz.  When my computer's off, I can hear it from about five feet away.  While I'm not thrilled about it, it really doesn't interrupt my listening experience at all -- I can't hear it when I have any of my headphones on.
I've tried the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 with three different pairs of headphones -- my //MARK\\K702 65th Anniversary, my //MARK\\DT880/600, and my //MARK\\HD598.  These headphones represent a pretty wide range of impedances.  The //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 sounds very good with the //MARK\\K702 and outstanding with the //MARK\\HD598, but I don't particularly care for it with the //MARK\\DT880/600.  This doesn't really surprise me, as I have always preferred the 600-ohm Beyers with OTL tube amps.  That's why I still have my //MARK\\Valhalla.
I think the amp is pretty neutral -- doesn't sound like it's emphasizing or lacking any frequency range in particular.
In high gain mode, there's a pretty high noise floor with my //MARK\\HD598 -- enough to be bothersome.  I can still hear some noise on the //MARK\\K702, but nothing on the //MARK\\DT880.
In low gain mode, there is practically no noise floor at all -- DEAD silent.  I don't think it results entirely from the fact that it's lower gain -- I think it must be due to the feedback Schiit implemented in the low gain mode.  In any case, I've very much preferred the low gain mode for this reason.
Other than the noise floor, I can't hear any difference between the low and high gain modes -- but I don't claim to have a golden ear, take with grain of salt, etc.
Low gain mode offers plenty of headroom for both my //MARK\\K702 and //MARK\\HD598.  There's a moderate amount of headroom for my //MARK\\DT880, but I'd probably switch to high gain mode for that headphone.
 
It's been a while since I've had my //MARK\\Asgard 1, but I'm not sure the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 offers that much improvement really.  Both are very good sounding amps.  My //MARK\\Asgard 1 didn't have the transformer buzz, and if I were to rank the noise floor from best to worst, it would be (//MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2, low gain) > (//MARK\\Asgard 1) > (//MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2, high gain).  Overall, I'm happy with the amp, but I don't find it to be a substantial improvement over the original //MARK\\Asgard.

=============================================

So, after about eight hours of listening here are my impressions of the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 driving my brand new //MARK\\HD800's.
 
First off, I was underwhelmed by the bass when I first started listening.  The headphones literally came off the truck and were hooked up mintues later (the UPS dude gave me a funny look when I came running to get the box ).  They were very cold from shipping, so cold in fact that condensation formed on the metal part of the head band.  The bass was there but not very pronounced.  I decided to let them warm up at least close to room temps before starting the eval.  I had been listening to the //MARK\\HE500's at the time, also so that might have been a factor (warming the amp up for the //MARK\\HD800's ).
 
After about half an hour I tried again.  Much better but still not a lot of bass there.  That's why I decided to give a good long listen.  A mix of //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 and straight form my computer's modded //MARK\\X-//MARK\\Fi.  Seven hours later (watching hockey on TV(muted), listening to music.  Who needs to hear the commentators anyway, bunch of useless info they spew...well any way back to the tack at hand.
 
The //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 does a respectable job of driving these phones.  Bare in mind this is the first time I have heard them ever, so I am comparing it to the others phones I have (see the earlier post). 
Comparing them to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500's there is less bass in the //MARK\\HD800's but what is there is crisper and more defined.  The //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500, um, ?mushes? or muddies maybe? the bass some. Some may want more quantity.  I noticed the recording/song style had a lot to do with it, some songs were just fine, others seemed to be lacking.  The //MARK\\HD800's have MUCH better mids more ?forward? and pronounced.  Very good with vocals (Alison Krauss, Anita Baker).  The highs were also more present, but never got to much.  Especially liked the attack on guitar strings, made their presence felt.  The //MARK\\HD800's felt a lot more balanced in the presentation, showed better separation, and greater detail.  Soundstage was slightly bigger. 
The comfort of the //MARK\\HD800's is on a whole new level, after half an hour I almost forgot I was wearing them.  This is a set of phone sfor the long haul listener as evidenced by the eight hour session I just completed, could not do that with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500's would need breaks periodically.  Also did not have to mod the //MARK\\HD800's as I had to with the //MARK\\He-//MARK\\500's and Grados for comfort.
The volume pot didn't need to be as high with the //MARK\\HD800's, also.  About 10:30 versus almost noon with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500's both on high gain. 
 
So the upshot is that the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 does a very good job, IMHO, driving the //MARK\\HD800's and it is very worth trying it out for yourself.  I plan to compare this to a friends Bottlehead crack once he gets it built (or maybe I should do one, too? hhmmmm...poor wallet is gonna have fits).
 
Let me know if there are specific questions.

I received my //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 and //MARK\\Bifrost a couple of days ago and have just now had time to spend on setting it up.
 
Mine is in perfect condition with no blemishes at all. Indeed the build quality is excellent, particularly when the cost is considered. 
 
It gets hot. Very hot. I'm wondering what I can use to stack it on top of the Bifrost. Maybe some glass blocks, something that is both heat resistant and isolating.
 
Yeah the buzz. It may be a deal breaker for me. The problem is that with this sort of equipment you have it close at hand and usually on the same desk as your computer so any noise is really noticeable. I've only just set it up so it may subside with some use or I may grow accustomed to it.
 
I'm going to break it in a bit and see what happens and then post back with some impressions.

For S&G I made a recording of the "noise" I hear when I pause Foobar and turn the volume pot all the way up on the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2.  I used //MARK\\HD800's and //MARK\\SR325i's for the test.  Hi gain.  You can hear the ticking sound I talked about in an earlier post.
 
Files can be found here: http://www.borderlandabate.org/noise
 
The recording device was my iRiver H120, so not the highest quality but you can clearly hear the noise.  It is not much louder than the background noise in my case.  So it is not that big a deal in my estimation, but it may be different for others.
 
For reference I did the same thing with my //MARK\\Magni and there is very little noise at full volume on it, so did not bother to record it.
 
P.S.  I am really liking the //MARK\\Asgard //MARK\\2 with the //MARK\\HD800's!!!

I received my //MARK\\A2 a few days ago, but only got to use it this evening. I've been using the //MARK\\Asgard 1 (late model, w/ relay mod) daily for about 6 months. I noticed an improvement with the //MARK\\Asgard 2 from the second I plugged it in. It's not easily described, but it just sounds fantastic.
 
  My rig: //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500///MARK\\K702///MARK\\SR60i///MARK\\Ety //MARK\\ER-//MARK\\4p, //MARK\\Schiit //MARK\\Asgard / //MARK\\Asgard2, //MARK\\Schiit //MARK\\Bifrost, //MARK\\Musical //MARK\\Fidelity //MARK\\V-//MARK\\Link //MARK\\192, //MARK\\Audioquest //MARK\\Evergreen //MARK\\RCA interconnects and USB cables.
 
  Quite honestly, I had so much fun re-listening to stuff in the last few hours that I can't write you a blow-by-blow description of //MARK\\A1 vs //MARK\\A2. I've been very happy with the //MARK\\A1, but now everything sounds more separated and clear - more space around every instrument, and singers stand out further in the mix. As I type this I'm listening to Eric Clapton playing Reconsider Baby (off "From the Cradle") - and I've only just realized there are two sax players in the horn section.
 
Initial thoughts/impressions:
* Increases the sonic differences between the //MARK\\K702 and //MARK\\HE500
* no hum at all - acoustic or electrical; even burning my ear against the case (guess I'm lucky?)
* I marginally prefer low gain setting (more than enough grunt for the //MARK\\HE //MARK\\500 in low gain mode)
* I don't remember any sonic change in the //MARK\\A1 after burning-in, and I suspect that this //MARK\\A2 has had extended burn in anyway (reading Jason's earlier posts about production).
 
Hope that helps.

Well, I think bearFNF did find something. I tried this on mine; I also did what Oldandslow suggested, but in addition I connected my Musical Fidelity V-CAN II instead of A2 and did the noise/hum test again.
 
Using Beyerdynamic T50p (32 Ohms), here is what I could hear.
 
1. Just to establish a reference point, Musical Fidelity V-CAN II, volume at 100%: very slight noise, could barely hear it. No hum, zero. Nothing at 0% volume.
 
2. A2, low gain, 0% volume: very low noise and low hum; while I could hear it, I could only tell it was there if I unplugged headphones and then plugged them back in. This stayed the same until volume reached 2 o'clock, then hum started to increase.
 
3. A2, low gain, 100% volume: clearly audible hum; about the same noise (masked by hum completely).
 
4. A2, high gain, 0% volume. Clearly audible noise (same as MF V-CAN II with volume at 100%); low hum as in No.2. I was surprised by the noise here, honestly. Hum stayed the same until volume reached 11:30 o'clock, then started to increase.
 
5. A2, high gain, 100% volume. Very strong hum, almost as loud as would be music at moderate volume. If any headphones would require listening at this position, it would be completely impossible. Please note though that T50p listening position was with volume at 9 o'clock in high gain, which is not required at all (low gain is where T50p belongs).
 
6. A2 with no interconnects: almost no hum (high gain, volume at 100%). While one could conclude that the hum was coming from outside, it is not so (see No.1). Even without that, as I was using AudioQuest Cinnamon RCA interconnect coming out of Musical Fidelity V-DAC II, I doubt this equipment would produce any audible hum/noise (I do use MF V-PSU II though).
 
I will pay more attention to the above with my other headphones and will update if anything differs.

Just want to update on my listening with the A2 with about 30 hours of unit burn in.
 
- it still hums with my UM3x IEM at low gain, the hum is there and you can notice the noisy floor. once i switch to my full size can, i can not hear any.
 
- the unit does hum(electrically), but i have to listening very carefully and put my ear around 3 ~ 4in next to the vent to hear it. Currently the amp is sitting about 2 arms length away and i can not hear the hum with or without the headphone on. i guess i have a unit that hum not as loud like other member on the board? or my ear is just plan woodie
 
- sound stage is improving, but the mid is still lay back with high a bit roll off on my HD650, with my W1000 it sounds only mid is lay off for sure, since this CAN is very vocal and it is easy to tell the vocal got pushed back a little.
 
- bass is nice and tighter with good control, it is not as booming as first few hours.
 
I have notice once i switched to high gain for both of HD650 and W1000, the sound sounds fuller.

Here is a few points on some differences between A2 and V-CAN II with DT990/600.
 
1. Using headphones analogy, on a high level, V-CAN II sounds more like DT990 while A2 sounds more like AKG Q701 (overall sonic signature only).
 
2. V-CAN II is warmer, sounds fuller and more lush.
 
3. A2 is more accurate and has better resolution, especially in high frequencies.
 

4. V-CAN II is slightly mellow; it is very smooth with a natural sound. A2 is a bit harsh (mids mostly) and often sounds somewhat steely and edgy. 
 

5. A2 has much better highs extension with great resolution while V-CAN II sounds a bit dark there and somewhat lacks details.
 
6. V-CAN II has excellent soundstage; it is very spacious, which very often creates 3D like effect where I can totally feel the ambience as if I was there. In comparison, A2 has good imaging but spaciousness is much less pronounced (sometimes to the point I have to specifically look for it to tell it's there).
 
7. A2 has much more controlled and tight bass; most of the time I can tell exactly where it is coming from. V-CAN II has softer and much fuller bass; on some tracks it sounds like bass fills the whole environment.

AH HA!!! EUREKA!!!  Ok, I will try to calm down.  I have found the source of the noise...
So, before I get to that, I tried the unplugging the inputs thing and there is zero noise indeed.  The Asgard 2 plugged into power with only headphones does not produce noise. That I can hear, anyway.
 
I got to thinking about a post I read somewhere about laptops and charging circuits...  So, I unplugged the laptop and did the test on the laptop battery only.  With inputs plugged in and ready to play music but with Foobar paused.  No ticking noise and only a very slight hiss of the volume.  Tried it with my APC J15BLK (J-Type Power Conditioner with Battery Backup) and the nosie was filter down, could barely hear the ticking sound and the hiss.  So this has to do with the AC coming from charging the laptop.  Or could it be the AC coming though the laptop to the Modi? See the extra credit work below for the answer.
 
So for my final trick, to confirm where the noise is coming from, I carted the whole lot into my computer room and hooked it up to my desktop.  No power brick or charging circuit here.  Just a very clean and line conditioned PSU on an APC AVR UPS, HEH.  The result?  No ticking or hum.  Just the hiss of volume.  The computer cooling fans were louder than the hiss from the Asgard 2.

I, too, like it quite a bit. Its a noticeable improvement over the original Asgard. There are a couple problems for me.
With my JH5's, I still get a static noise floor, regardless of high or low gain. Is there no way around that? Or perhaps its just the fact of life when using it with a computer. . . .
Also, the high/low gain switch... when I turn it to low gain, only the right channel gets softer, so its pretty much not useful for me. This is with my JH5's or my DT990s. Anyone else see this?
FWIW, I'm using A2 with Bifrost out of the optical on my MacBook... Also putting my ear right up to it (burning sensation in my ear lol) I can hear a slight buzz from the unit itself, but it doesn't bother me at all. The computers in the office are much noisier.
I'll be contacting Schiit and I fully expect them to be excellent in dealing with my issue, but just wanted to see if it was more widespread, especially the gain issue...

The Asgard 2's preamp outputs won't power speakers. They're intended to be used with external amplifiers or powered monitors. The output signal varies depending on the volume knob position which can be a major convenience in some setups. Personally, I find it to be one of the most exciting new features but there are many that won't need that functionality. I'm loving the idea of being able to integrate the A2 as a key player in my stereo listening experience, instead of it just being a uni-tasker, as Alton Brown may call it.
 
As for the HE-400s, I can't speak from personal experience yet but I do recall reading an impression in one of the Schiit threads several days ago. From what I remember, the guy seemed unable to notice any glaring differences between the Schiit and his old amp. Apparently orthodynamic headphones aren't as sensitive to differences in headphone amplifiers. I'm sure someone much more qualified than myself will be able to chime in with some firsthand insight.

Thanks for the info. I am quite unfamiliar with pro audio gear such as powered monitors. That usage seems to make a lot of sense, since you could easily swap between monitors and headphones. How exactly would you switch the output though? If you have headphones plugged in, does it automatically output through headphones and if you don't, it outputs through the monitors? I don't currently have any desk speakers... but I like the idea of being able to add some. I also see it as a big advantage over the Magni.
 
I looked around and found this picture of the rear of an M-Audio monitor. I don't see any RCA input so I'm wondering how you would connect something like this to the Asgard 2? I have no idea what TRS or XLR are...

I faintly remember reading that post also, and how orthos aren't affected by amps as much as dynamics. I understand that the difference *between* amps may not be that great, but what about from NO amp to the Asgard 2?

I took the amp to a silent area of the home here and took some time to listen. It does seem like the hum is resonating or ringing with the case and this is making it much worse than it should be.
 
I find if I take my fist and just rest it on the Schiit logo it cuts the noise by about half. As well putting it up on some isolation cones has helped a bit. I wonder if the fellow who had taken his apart had noticed how the transformer is fixed to the board as this may be something that could be fixed with silicone washers and a little damping etc.
 
The amp itself sounds good so far, although I don't have a lot of hours on it. I really want to love this thing so I don't know what to do. Do you think Schiit would let me trade up to the Lyr? How would the sound be comparable?

Hey all,
 
A quick update on Asgard 2:
 
1. The real problem is highly variable transformer mechanical hum, coupled with a relatively loud production environment that masked the worst of the problems. Think traffic noise and trains--our facility is on a busy road, and next to a train station. Our fault--we did not anticipate this problem, due to the prototype transformers being silent.
 
2. We've done two things about this:
 
a. Created a special "quiet room" for transformer hum verification to sort the transformers. We ended up pulling a lot of them out of production and sending them back to the manufacturer in the later part of the first run. 
 
b. Worked with the transformer manufacturer on a new process to reduce hum. The protos seem fine, but we'll see what happens when the real articles come for production in a couple of weeks.
 
3. When we start shipping again, all Asgard 2s will be sorted through the new "quiet room" and any noisy transformers culled before shipping. I'm hoping they're *all* quiet, but if they are not, we'll work with the transformer manufacturer until it is right.
 
Apologies if you've been affected by these teething issues. If you have any problems with your Asgard 2, contact us and we'll make it right.
 
Hope this clears things up a bit.
 
All the best,
Jason

Looks like Schiit this week pushed back Asgard 2's resumed shipping date to April 1. I think it was originally March 21? I put an order in shortly after the shipping suspension and Stoddard's announcement here about addressing the hum issue. My March 25 backorder date hasn't changed since the recent shipping date revision. So perhaps the new date is just a revised expectation for new orders now that orders have stacked up in the interim. 
 
During the hiatus, I've succumbed to re-examining my purchase decision, but I haven't come up with a compelling alternative to power my HD-650s and the Airmotiv 4s I plan to order to complete my desktop rig once the A2 ships (good timing; I just noticed the A4s are on sale through the end of the month!). Many comparable amps, including tube amps, come at roughly double the price to get the preamp outs and with other features I don't need (DACs, more inputs/outputs, etc.). Then again, I didn't think I needed the preamp outs (or the speakers) until I thought through it a bit more, which let me to the A2 vs. the Magni I originally had in mind.

My A2 has some transformer hum but I haven't noticed any issues with signal noise. I've controlled the hum quite a bit by putting a weight on top of the case, but I assume I will have to send it in for RMA soon. I've been waiting for the next generation of A2's to ship and see what the reviews are like here.
 
As far as the sound goes it is a really nice hot sounding little class a amp. It sounds fantastic with my HD650s.
 
I feel the HE-500s are more power hungry than is generally assumed. It seems that pretty much any source can achieve a decent low end and a dynamic slam with them, but if you want treble and space it takes juice. There is a clear difference running the HE-500 with the low or high gain setting on the A2. I find the mids and treble are recessed on the low gain setting, and that leads me to think they would benefit from even more power. 
 
That's not to say they don't sound good with the A2, they do. But you can't help but get the feeling they are capable of more.
 
  
=============================================

My A2 also has the mechanical transformer hum issue, but the headphone output in low gain mode is very quiet.  No appreciable noise to be heard with my SR60i or HD598.
 
High gain mode, on the other hand, is a different story.  With either of the aforementioned headphones, there's a pretty good amount of background noise.  I can still hear a little bit of background noise on my K702 65th Anniversary.  With my 600-ohm DT880, I don't hear any noise.
 
Ultimately, this works just fine for me.  The A2 is able to swing plenty of power in the low gain mode to drive my SR60i, HD598, and K702.65.  I only ever flip it up to the high gain mode with my DT880/600.  No noise floor to be heard with any of those setups.
 
A couple interesting things to note from Schiit's website:
 
SNR: More than 102db, unweighted, referenced to 1V RMS, in low gain mode
Topology: Fully discrete, single-ended Class A with single voltage gain stage, no overall feedback in high gain mode, 12dB feedback in low gain mode
 
The SNR figure is given for the low gain mode, indicating that this is presumably the better of the two modes in that regard.  I could be wrong, but I suspect the better SNR figure is achieved due to the 12dB of feedback they used in the low gain mode.

 Updated STATUS: In beta test. We expect to start shipping April 26.
 
And I just recieved email from Schiit. :(
 
"Please accept our apologies on the Asgard 2 ship date continuing to slip. We want these to be absolutely, 100% perfect, so we're being ultra-paranoid about every little detail, so this has meant delays as we've worked with our vendors, and did extended internal testing. Now, we're confident that every Asgard 2 we ship will be free from mechanical hum, anodizing issues, and grounding problems. 
 
That's the good news. The bad news is that we still want to get some extended input on the Asgard 2s, so we're sending a handful of beta test products to listeners. They'll run them and weigh in on whether or not we've solved everything to their satisfaction. 
 
What does this mean? If the beta test goes well, which we expect it will, we expect to be shipping Asgard 2s by April 26. Note: "expect" = "educated guess," not "guarantee."
 
We understand if these delays are frustrating when you have an order in the queue, but we also want to make sure we are shipping great stuff. "

Just got my Asgard 2 and couldn't be happier.  This is my first real headphone amp so I'm in no rush to jump in with grandiose claims about its sound.  I will however, say that I can't imagine better build quality for its class.  It really is quite beautiful and solid as a rock.  No transformer hum of any kind and a very quiet noise floor on low gain with my fairly low impedance Sony MDR-7506.  Also doing a great job as a preamp in my desktop rig.  In a perfect world there would be a frontside switch so I don't have to keep unplugging my cans, but the fact that they included pre outs at all is a huge win in my book.  Looking forward to lots of listening ahead.  On a side note, I ordered a pair of pyst rca interconnects as well and, being an idiot, didn't fully take to heart the ample warnings Schiit has stating that these guys are quite short.  Used to thinking in meter and half meter lengths, 6 inch cables are really designed only to connect two components directly stacked.  I ended up making it work, but it was a bit hairy.  If you aren't stacking Schiit gear I'd heed the warnings.

Mine shipped on the 26th. I'd ordered it more than a month before. I've been using it primarily as a preamp for a new pair of Airmotiv 4s at my desk, with which I'm too enamored to put on my HD-650s for long, and even then haven't had much time for critical listening, so no listening report to speak of.
 
Dandy preamp though, and I do love the A4s. The bass is so much more "present" than with the headphones, and that with the speakers on stands and a decent distance from the wall, although the positioning may still be boosting the bass a bit. A2 volume goes up to about 12:00 before distorting the A4s with their volume turned up to max, so a good bit of adjustment room.
 
Now I just need to get my first-generation Meridian Explorer replaced, which I ordered a month before the A2, and for which I received the return slip a day before the A2 shipped. So after waiting more than a month for my new A2, I get to go without my new DAC for two weeks. I guess I'm just lucky.

Both here and in the Schiit owners site I'm enjoying discussions about their amps. A lot of it seems to fall into a sort of "good-better-best" discussion. Since I'm bored today, and nobody asked, here's my 2 cents:
I think they are making different amps for different uses and tastes. In my case, in 2012 when I began putting together a desktop headphone system, I already knew that I had enjoyed all-tube amplification (meaning tube input & output) for speakers and headphones since the early 90s. So, after reading reviews and comments, I decided to take a chance on the "not ideal" (but not forbidden) match of Valhalla with the 32 ohm RS1i. I am delighted with the result.
So I strongly suggest that anyone shopping amps look closely at 1) amps that would/would not be suitable for specific cans; and 2) what reviewers describe the sonic characteristics of those amps to be. A great example is the Six Moons review(s) for Asgard, Valhalla, and Lyr. Great writing, informative about the SOUND of the three amps (having them at the same time), and fun! This stuff is really helpful for all of us who can't audition multiple products before purchase.
OK, time for me to "Crawl Back (Under My Stone)", open an Avery White Rascal, and do some listening to RT.

I just got my Asgard 2 using with a Grado 225i which is not supposed to require amplification, but benefits.
 
(Virgin Newbie Alert-this is my first decent set of cans and my absolute first experience with an amp. I have never listened w/ a DAC, and currently don't listen to my computer that much. I listen to Itunes files and stream using an Internet receiver. Also, I have ordered a Sonos Connect that will allow me to access all my digital music through my stereo system and play throughout the house on different wireless speakers. My plan is to see how I might add a DAC into the mix to improve the SQ and combine that w/ my A2 if possible. )
 
Just a few minutes last night listening to:
 
 A) dedicated Onkyo 7030 CD player, and
 
B) Rhaspody streaming service on an Onkyo streaming receiver. 
 
I was expecting minimal improvement from my CD player. It has a Woflson DAC and I have previously thought the SQ listening to CD's from the HP jack on my Onkyo CD player was quite good. I was wrong! The sound quality from the A2 through my dedicated Onkyo 7030 CD player vs listening to the CD player's HP jack sounds, fuller, richer and more vibrant. I'm not an audiophile. But, I think I can recognize good sound. The A-2 just sounds better.
 
 I listened to a little classical, jazz and metal. I'm mostly a rock guy, but I like classical, ambient, folk and jazz as well. I don't do country, top 40 pop-have to pass on the Rhianna/Britney Spears,etc., EDM or opera. I'm game for everything else though.
 
I noticed the difference more in the nuanced music of classical the most-a Mozart CD. I'm assuming that is because the nuances in Mozart are more apparent than sludge and thrash metal! Looking forward to listening to some more nuanced  prog, blues, folk, and well recorded classic rock to see.
 
As stated, I don't own a DAC yet. But, I agree w/ Steve Guttenburg ( hope I have that name right) who referenced the 225i and Asgard in a CNET review that caught my eye. He said something to the effect that a Grado 225 and Asgard (pre A-2) was a great budget entry into high quality sound. Thus far, I would have to agree.
 
Call my pleasantly surprised.
 
Now to decide if I want to spring for the Biforst or Peach Tree DAC-It which I believe will allow me to use with my Sonos and if I'm lucky also with my A2.

The Sonos device I'm talking about is the Sonos Connect. Info is found on Sonos.com.
I get what you're asing about, and the short answer is: no, you don't have to. Part of what separates the Asgard 2 from the original Asgard is the preamp. This means that you connect the Asgard 2 to your DAC, and your stereo to the Asgard 2 preamp output. This way music will play through your headphones when they're connected, and through your stereo when you disconnect them from the A2. Please note that the volume knob on the A2 will then affect the output to your stereo; controlling the volume. This might not be optimal if you're connecting it to a stereo preamp, as you then have two volume controls for the same signal. The best solution then would be to set the A2 to 60%-90% of max volume, and then just use the volume knob on your stereo to get the desired volume.
Another option is a DAC with both balanced and unbalanced outputs. That way you could connect the A2 to the unbalanced outputs, and the balanced to your stereo (if it has got balanced input). Depending on the DAC you should either get sound in both the A2 and stereo, or you choose between balanced/unbalanced via a switch on the DAC. The Sonos Connect has both Coax and optical digital outputs, so you can in theory use two DACs should you so desire. I very much doubt the Connect outputs only to coax OR optical.
The last option is of course to have the cables for both your A2 and stereo behind the DAC, and just insering the one you want at the time. As long as you manage to keep the unused cable in place behind your DAC (so it doesn't fall behind your rack or get pulled away when you move your other cables) this isn't really that impractial.
 
In any case you should make sure that the Sonos Connect is set to fixed volume, as you'll be controlling volume on the A2 or your stereo. The Sonos volume control would just degregade SQ and make your life harder.
Hope this helps!

I just received my Asgard 2 today. I had a short ten minute listening session soon as I grabbed it out of the box. There is no transformer hum whatsoever, the noise floor is low and it started to smooth out some of the pops and hisses from some of my older FLAC recordings that my DT880 loves to bring out. Comfortable listening level with Windows volume set at 50%, was around 1o clock or 2 oclock(slightly past halfway). I currently do not have a standalone DAC I'm just running RCA's from my HT Omega Claro PC soundcard which has 24-bit 192khz capability.
 
Overall I'm very impressed from the out of box experience. I've heard solid states don't take any burn in time and it seems to me like this is the case from the first listen. The amplifier doesn't really seem to add any coloration to the sound but it helped bring out the midrange and smooth out the detail in the high frequency range.
 
My headphone is a DT880 250 ohm. I'd be interested to hear the 600 ohm version and compare if anyone has tried it yet. I feel like the Asgard 2 compliments my DT880s as they are supposed to sound detailed, analytical, neutral, and bright in the high range. I noticed a slight increase in low frequency bass texture but not really an increase in actual quantity.
 
This is just my experience from the first 10 minutes I had the chance to open the box and plug it in before heading out to work on my research paper(ya I'm a poor college kid on a Schiit budget currently enrolled at SDSU). I will give more opinions as I get the chance to listen to it more but so far very impressed and also stoked that there is no transformer hum that many people complained about.

I keep my A2 tucked under a computer monitor, so I can access the face of it from under the front of the monitor (next to the monitor pedestal). Surprisingly, barely a trace of the considerable heat generated by the A2 can be felt on the bottom or back of the monitor, even though the monitor bottom is only about half an inch above the A2 faceplate. The A2's top vent is mainly behind the back of the monitor, though, with air to breathe. Point is, the A2 is as hot to the touch as everyone says it is, and deserves Schiit's cautionary commentary about it, but all that said, it actually dissipates the heat quite effectively. 
 
By the way, after only a brief confirmation-of-operation listening session with my HD-650s, the A2 was obviously superior to the integrated headphone amp in my Meridian Explorer (v2 with reduced output impedance). Not that that'll surprise anyone, or that the ME amp section is poor, but I found the confirmation somewhat gratifying. So far I'm very happy with the A2, fed by the ME, driving Airmotiv 4s, with a mix of file types and genres from lossy to 192 kHz. I'll get some quality time with the HD-650s at some point, but transfixed with the speakers for now. 
 
One other minor observation so far is that the sound is so "clean" that I don't realize how loud I have the music until I get a little fatigued and turn it down. That's the point I realize, whoa, that was pretty loud. Kind of like boiling a frog on the way up. Point here is, distortion or sibilance or some other harshness is not the factor limiting listening volume for any length of time.

I'm excited to hear about it! My next upgrade is an uber Schiit Bifrost and I'm already loving my A2!! I think it's the greatest deal in the history of mankind as far as headphone amplifiers go. I'm glad to know that we are actually receiving the new and improved A2 compared to the one that had issues in February when it was released. I know I didn't receive a defective unit because there is no transformer hum that people were complaining about with the first release of the A2. I'd love to see an A/B comparison between the Bifrost and another DAC if you currently own one. I've been shopping around for DACs and everyone's been telling me that this Schiit is some endgame material under $1000(which I plan to never exceed in my college life). It's between the Music Fidelity V-DACmkII, the uber Schiit Bifrost, or the Cambridge Audio DACMagic. I think I'm willing to spend the extra $100 and it would probably come out to around $460 plus tax without the USB input

=============================================

After about a week to evaluate, I decided to share a few comments on my comparison of the Schiit amps that I’ve owned. Asgard, Asgard 2 and lyr. Let me start with the A1 vs A2 as the A2 vs lyr gets much more complicated.
 
The A2 is a clear upgrade from the original Asgard. It’s cleaner, more resolving and seems to bring out the best in my hd650 and maddogs. Detail retrieval is better and this is a good thing for all of those who tend to use darker headphones. Bass presence is more punchy and accurate…not leaving me wanting for more from the bottom end at all. The original Asgard house sound is certainly there with a nice relaxed and natural presentation. And then the amp’s signature is improved across the board. I love the new flexibility built into the A2. The gain switch is a welcome improvement. I can now rock my orthos with authority and then flip the gain switch to get the most out of my pair of gr07’s. Now that’s covering your bases. The A2 still gets hot but not quite as hot as the A1 just using my very scientific feel test. Also I like knowing that I can add some powered monitored when I’m ready and the A2 is there for me with the pre-amp outs. For $250 you’ll be hard pressed to do any better for overall sound presentation and versatility.
 
The next question many will ask, I know that I did, is how close the A2 gets to the lyr. I did a comparison of the A1 to the lyr last year and found that the lyr clearly more gifted across the board. But it will always be difficult to compare the lyr to the A2 or any solid state amp due to fact that the lyr is a hybrid amp and sports tubes. This truly complicates any evaluation of the two. Some will love the ability to roll tubes and others will loathe it. I have lived with the lyr long enough to know what tubes I enjoy and feel no real need to “roll” lot’s of tubes.
 
Okay, so here’s the short answer to the lyr vs A2 comparison. Although the A2 closes the gap considerably, the lyr retains its superiority. With good tubes the visceral bass is improved and is tightened slightly. Vocals are a bit more forward and “sweeter” sounding. Maybe more lifelike is a better description of the mids on the lyr. Of course the improvement does come at a cost, almost twice the cost actually. Add the price of good tubes to the lyr and in fact you have spent twice as much than the A2. Although the improvements are there, it takes a careful ear to hear and appreciate them. The performance  is actually quite close.
 
There are drawbacks for owning the lyr. Obtaining good tubes is at the front of that list. Some tubes have micro phonic issues and will generate unwanted noise. I also feel compelled to turn the lyr off each time that I finished using it given the limited life of the tubes. Then to get back to an ideal listening environment you should let the tubes warm properly before listening again. This is a minor inconvenience but can still be aggravating.
 
At the end of the day I settled on the Asgard 2. The convenience, close performance and ability to drive just about anything were enough to win out over the lyr for me. I rolled my savings over into an uber upgrade board for the bifrost and couldn’t be happier.

Nice review. Confirms with listening what I had deduced on paper, that the A2 is a very good value, even within Schiit's own line. So good, that it makes the Bifrost look a little expensive as a DAC pairing for A2. Not that Bifrost is overpriced, or that it completely outclasses A2; clearly Schiit intends for them to pair, and the A2 would seem to outclass the Modi by a greater difference. Still, the Uber Bifrost with USB at $520 presents more than a 2:1 DAC:amp price ratio, whereas 1:1 or even a bit lower seems more balanced, and even the base Bifrost is 40% more than that, yet seems a bit wanting in that configuration. There are good $175-$300 DAC choices that would seem to pair well with A2.
 
Not that there are any hard-and-fast rules about budget proportions, or that a "DAC heavy" allocation is a bad thing. To the extent there's a question here, do you think A2 does the Uber Bifrost justice? It appears you do, but if you (or anyone else) care to elaborate, please do.

Been a while since I've been on here, but I've had my Asgard 2 for about a week now and have to say I'm very satisfied with it.  To give some background, I'm currently running this setup:
 
Mix of ALAC, AAC, and MP3s > iTunes > Creative X-Fi Titanium HD > Asgard 2 > Grado 325i & Beyerdynamic DT 770 32 LE
 
To start, the Asgard 2 and DT 770 shine together.  It opens up the sound a bit more, adds some separation, and overall just gives it a more powerful sound.  Extremely satisfied with this combo.
 
I have mixed feelings so far with the A2/325i combo.  I'm not sure if it's just the sheer fact that the headphones seat a different way on my head at certain times, or that at certain times I'm being too analytical, but it's a very love/hate relationship.  Some times I will sit down with it and absolutely love the sound.  Other times I will sit down and just feel a mush of 'bleh'.  Again, not sure if it's just not burned in (not sure I'm a believer, really) or if I'm just trying too hard myself.  Can't be buyer's remorse...it was a gift.

I am curious at how detailed the A2 is. I have a pair of sweetly detailed balanced armatures. I also have a dragonfly USB dac/amp that is the closest I've been able to get to eliminating noise / static, but noise still noticeable and present. I know it's built into some recordings, but I do own a lot of clean recordings too, and the noise thing isn't present on higher impedance hps. 
 
What I'm getting at is... I would like to know if the A2 is (1), great enough to preserve / not muddy or otherwise interfere with the source and balanced armature's sound, and (2), while on low gain, quiet and low power enough that there isn't noticeable static or noise when listening. If I order an A2, my set-up will look like this: Macbook with 320s and ALAC > Dragonfly USB dac portion only > A2 > ATH-CK100PRO. I want the same or higher level of detail from the hps, just without any noise. 
 
Thanks for any advice, guys!

Well, the Bifrost is better, but if you're only going to be using USB the Modi is quite good (and I do maintain that unless you have them side by side you probably wouldn't notice a difference, at least with the Bifrost I had, which was first gen. USB and no uber upgrade).
 
After selling all my desktop stuff I'm actually coming back to it and I decided to go with Modi and Asgard 2 this time. Just couldn't justify spending the extra money on Bifrost when I'm only going to be using USB, when I'm in the situation of buying something new (Bifrost is easier to justify when you already own it).
 
I mainly decided on Asgard 2 because I prefer the look of it, like the volume control a lot more than the Magni's, and might possibly eventually use it as a pre.
 
Of course I wouldn't recommend anyone base their purchasing decisions on what I do, but since the review was mentioned that's what I've ended up with months later

I'm going to say this, and how relevant it is to you, I'll let you decide.
 
I am primarily using the DT 770 32 LEs with the Asgard 2.  I also have a pair of 80 ohm 770s.  
 
My friend ordered a M&M stack a couple months back, and I got the chance to listen my 770s (80 ohms) on the setup.  I found the sound to be too 'bright' for my tastes, and in the process took out some of the famous DT 770 bottom end.  However, once I disconnected the Modi and solely hooked up the Magni via RCA to RCA to my Creative X-Fi THD, I enjoyed the sound immensely.  The Magni was still a brighter sounding amp, but it wasn't as cold and analytical sounding as it was with the Modi in the mix.
 
Because of that experience, I now own the Asgard 2, and use them with my 32 ohm LEs.  I prefer the 32 ohm LEs over the 80s as they have better mids, and I've actually come to find their pleather pads very comfy.  Regardless, it still carries the same characteristics that I remembered the Magni having.  I cannot give you a direct comparison between the two amps as my friend lives a bit far off, but needless to say, I think the DT 770s (of any version) match very well with the Schiit line of amps (of the two SS ones I've tried, obviously).  It brightens an overall warm and bassy headphone, which IMO is a perfect thing for the Beyers.

Modi is an intriguing matchup with Asgard 2. Despite the credible endorsement earlier in this thread and the fit implied by the matching form factor, Bifrost is still a lot of DAC to accommodate on an Asgard 2 budget. Even if Asgard 2 outclasses Modi, it's not by an outrageous amount. Maybe you figure you can take advantage of the more rapid pace of DAC evolution down the line with an upgrade when you're more flush, or you might simply deem amplification worth proportionally more of your investment than DAC. If you want USB and you don't want sample rates higher than 96 kHz and you don't want portability (or an integrated amp) and you do want a worthy upgrade to a stock computer DAC, then Modi seems like a logical choice for A2. There are sure to be shortcomings at the entry level price point, but spending only $99 certainly lowers your risk of disappointment, and for $350, you get quite a bit of upstream firepower for desktop listening.

I wouldn't use the word poor, as I could see that being a good thing for other sources.  In my case, though, the Modi wasn't really necessary.  It's a great DAC, hands down, but I, personally, did not enjoy the sound I was hearing when the M&M stack were being auditioned.  BUT that is me.  You are right; people find that match up to be just fine or even perfect for their tastes, but I'm only one person voicing his opinion to you.
 
That being said, I do not enjoy the sound that goes through my Grado 325is when they are hooked up to the Asgard 2.  But a huge factor in this could be that I'm so accustomed to the DT 770s that I have outgrown their sound signature.  The other day I hooked them directly up to my Mac and didn't feel that magic that I used to feel with the Grados.  The sound now seems mushy in the top range, and lacking in definition.  As a result, they have been sidelined quite a bit lately.
 
I have a pair of HD 600 on the way so that I may finally audition them to see if I like them.  My general taste in sound signature has possibly changed, so that could be the reason for my dislike of the A2 and 325i combo.  We shall see, come Friday.

Modi costs $99. What do you expect? But I strongly suggest if you like Schiit gear, just pay couple hundreds bucks more for the Bifrost, a lot of people have built an altar around this humble little DAC. Modi is 4 folks who want mobility. That thing is small enough to pack into your backpack even with Magni in tow. If you hang around an audio-centric forum like this, surely you want something more than just decent sound coming from your phones. I prefer to get a substantial DAC and mix and match amplifiers to suit your headphones, your moods or for fun & giggles. There are a lot of exciting gear coming up in a few years. This market segment seems to explode recently. Look at Musical Fidelity and their M1 offering. Naim with their Unity. Bryston just release a new gear. Burson introduced more low-cost models. Loving the competition.

HD 600 are here.  They are absolutely wonderful.  People do not lie when they say it's an all-around headphone.  It absolutely devours music that is produced/mastered particularly well.
 
Because the Asgard 2 is rather 'bright' (if I haven't iterated this enough already), I don't really sense the famous 'veil' that I've read about.  Though:  I do know that people say the HD 600 has less of this than the HD 650.  It's nice to have some mids back, and it's really an improvement over both the Grados and Beyers as either one doesn't do mids particularly well; or accurate for that matter.
 
The bass is what I'd consider to be fairly neutral.  It is a touch warm when necessary, and in turn helps it's all-rounder reputation.
 
I'm surprised to say that I really love treble on this headphone.  It's the most natural sounding treble I've ever heard.  It's not sparkly, and not muffled, but it's 'tingly' if that makes any sense.
 
Vocals are failry emotional and natural, which is another aspect I was looking for.  Because of this, two songs that sounded so awfully unnatural on either the SR325is or DT770s now sound 'magical' again.  I shall leave you with them:
 
(Not best quality, but you get the idea):

Your comment about the wall wart power supplies may be true up to a point, but consider this. The V-Dac II comes with a wall wart power supply, but the company also sells an upgraded power supply for it, and there are several retailers that say you can even do better than that for power and they sell an even heftier power supply for it. Obviously the standard wall wart leaves a lot to be desired. So bottom line, I totally agree with your comment saying dedicated power supplies are the way to go. What I find odd is that a power supply would change the sound of a dac all that much, an amplifier..sure they need a fair amount of power to do what they do, but there are dac's running off usb power just fine. I just find it strange that they would need all that much power to do their job.

All of these look like great options.  Going to keep these in mind; thanks guys!

These were my thoughts, too....Ironically enough, I just sold my DT770 80s in that box...best packing job ever...it really was some serious protection.  Pic is relevant:

 

 
Ironically, my newly acquired HD 650 will be arriving tomorrow.  I couldn't resist the deal and the fact that I had to ultimately know if I would like the HD 650 better than the HD 600 or not.  Here are a few findings that have me believe the synergy of the A2 and HD 650 will be good:
 
The Asgard 2 is a 'bright' amp.  I will stand by this assumption, and this is after around 150-200 hours of use, so any type of 'burn-in' on the amp is most likely out of the way.  The HD 600s (via others opinions) are anything but a harsh headphone, but the Asgard 2 can take a few tracks and put it to its' limits.  The HD 650 is supposedly a 'dark' headphone with a 'veiled' treble.  If my assumptions are right, The A2 will brighten that top end of the HD 650, tighten its slightly more 'better' bass response, and overall just match it to the teeth.  Being as the HD 600 is fairly neutral, I feel that based on these assumptions/findings the HD 650s will excel with the A2 moreso than the HD 600s.  I also think that if this is true, the HD 600 would be better suited for a tube amp over the HD 650.
 
Of course these are all baseless assumptions until I get the HD 650s tomorrow, but boy, am I excited.

Yeah, I'm still very excited.  FedEx is really varying in the time they arrive here.  It can be anywhere from noon until 6 PM.  I'm hoping I don't become an unlucky case and they don't deliver until tomorrow .  However, my sinuses seem to be a bit congested today, so I might have to hold off on some impressions .  And I will try to share my opinion in all applicable threads.  I'm not a true expert like some here as the A2, HD 600 and HD 650 are my first real foray into the full-sized spectrum.  Of course I have my DT770s and Grado SR325i, but I still feel they are of a different level...hard to really express/explain.
 

 
Yeah, I sell/trade quite a bit of stuff (mostly on the computer forum I frequent) and I always believe getting stuff shipped properly is paramount.  I used a box twice the size I needed once just because I wanted to be sure of no problems arising.  I'd rather do that and spend the extra $5 than to end up needing to refund the money for a broken product that is then useless.  Sorry for your bad experience :(.
 

 
I am the same way, and because of this I was very skeptical about trying the likes of the Sennheiser HD 6xx series.  I came directly from Grados and Beyers, so I was used to really 'sparkly' treble.  And I liked it.  I still do like the Beyers.  The Grados don't really match well with the A2, in my opinion, though, and drove me to disliking them.  This probably is why the recommendation is to use Grados with a tube amp for ultimate synergy.
 
The HD 600s, to me, have some of the most natural sounding treble I've heard from a full-sized headphone or IEM.  The Ultrasone HFI-780s I tried were terribly sparkly, sibilant, and unnatural (hated them), Grados gave treble a shine that actually made it unnatural, but highly enjoyable, the Beyers gave it a sparkle that made you forget about the not-so-hot mids, but the HD 600 give such an accurate representation of how things like cymbals should sound that it's almost scary.
 
However, the HD 600 seem to be very dependent on production of music.  I don't expect the the HD 650s to be completely different monsters, but I think a lot has to do with the bass response.  Just from looking at a few FR graphs, you can see the bass response of the HD 600 drops after a certain point, leaving much to be desired in the sub-bass area of things.  This really only applies to more modern music (pop, hip hop, rap, and even certain hardcore sub-genres), as things like Yes, Pink Floyd, The Beatles sound quite brilliant, and the HD 600s sit there, stare you in the face and tell you "these artists took time to produce their music the right way."  Rightly so, this leaves things like Dubstep, EDM, rap, hip hop, and other similar 'bassy' genres to leave a feeling of dissatisfaction.  Of course, if you're like me, and anticipated this, you have a pair of headphones to remedy for this (in my case, the DT770 LEs).
 
To comment more on the A2 and what it does:
 
The A2 does a great deal to improve separation over a non-amped source.  This is even true with the 32 ohm DT770s.  At the same time, it constantly brings up the point that "Hey, this band you really like; when they made this album in the studio, they didn't use 20 different mics on each drum like they should have." Or "Hey, they didn't level match any of the instruments properly, and that's why this cymbal and guitar note sound awful together."  This is a disadvantage for around 60% of my music as I listen to a lot of hardcore, metalcore, and progressive metal from some not-so-known or wealthy artists.  Therefore, I don't blame them, my equipment does.  This was truly evident with the Grados.  The HD 600s are a bit revealing of this characteristic, but nothing like the Grados.  In turn, this probably means a slightly more 'colored' headphone will sound better and not point out some of the glaring flaws that certain music has.
 
These are bands that sound great through the A2 + HD 600 combo:
 
Between the Buried and Me
Despised Icon
Yes
The Beatles
Pink Floyd
Meshuggah
My Morning Jacket
Nights Like These
Oh Land
One Day As a Lion
Protest the Hero
Radiohead
Rage Against the Machine
Red Hot Chili Peppers (though does bring out the distortion in the recordings; more specifically on Californication)
Say Anything
 
There are many more, but I feel that is a good representation of things it excels at.  Quite a bit of difference in styles there, though it's nowhere near a complete one.

pez, 
if you have a tracking number you can follow your FedEx delivery progress (I won't mention "or lack of" ) From my listening experience the HD650 is non fatiguing & does basically everything well.  It does them even better, when the synergy exists between "it" and the amp + good source.   I also agree that the quality of the recording will affect the end result. Then I seem to discover some hidden side of the HD650 previously not perceived using a different or lesser amplifier/source. On average though with a good synergy on all levels this headphone will surprise you and then some : a previously undistinguished or buried/muffled sound, instrument in the midrange or background will appear to come out of nowhere, sometimes the treble will be very clear even sounding ever so slightly bright, quite surprising for a "Dark" labeled HP.  I've owned much more expensive headphones in the past but have always come back to my HD650. Again if the source, amp synergy & recording is decent, they can be played loud without any distortion  and under those circumstances there is no veil which I've never experienced with the HD650 in the first place 
Between me and the HD650 it's a love affair.  My apologies to members of this thread, as I realize this is an Asgard 2 thread.  I just wanted to share my personal view on the HD650's sound/synergy prospect with his Asgard 2. -Thanks.Edited by Old Groucho - 6/26/13 at 10:30am

I agree.  I read the InnerFidelity article about the difference between the 580, 600, and 650, and I believe they made a good point that people were so used to Grado and Beyer headphones that when they went to the Sennheiser HD 580 and HD 6xx, they felt like they were a 'darker' headphone.
 
My HD 650 arrived shortly after my post :p.  I've been listening to them for the past 3 hours now and I have to say I'm impressed.  Obviously I've reduced my bias between both pairs as I didn't pay an outrageous price for either one, but so far I'm liking the HD 650 more.  The seller I bought them from said he had put about 100 hours into them, so they're about on par with the usage I've put into the HD 600.
 
I don't feel either pair are 'veiled'.  The HD 650 do sound 'darker' as they do have a bit more bass (which is VERY nice) and a bit more mid range to them.  I feel the bass colors the sound, but not so much that you wouldn't still consider them as 'serious'.  They're definitely more 'fun' than the HD 600, and as a result, makes them a better 'all-rounder' (IMO).  As I stated about the HD 600, the treble feels natural to the point where cymbals are scary-accurate sounding.  Obviously the bass is still not at DT 770 proportions, but the extension is very nice and welcome.  Enough so that after I've adjusted to the sound, might just sell the LE 32s I have.  
 
Let me know if I've left anything out :).  I'm gonna give my ears a rest so that I can let the experience resonate a bit .
 
 
 

 
I too, kinda thought the Asgard 2 had a somewhat 'narrow' sound stage, but I never had an A1 to compare.  It seems to be appropriately distributed.  If a track makes use of positioning, it points it out.  If not, it just sounds 'normal'.

After a lengthy and thought out personal deliberation (translation : rationalizing/convincing myself ) I've decided to go ahead and get the A2.  I sent an email to Jason asking him if the humming problem which was mentioned by a few members on different posts was finally fixed; I also asked him if this problem was mainly related to a few amps from the initial batch or two in production.  Awaiting his answers.  I won't be ordering before July 5th since I'm presently on holidays & can't be home for delivery.  When I do receive it (via FedEx) I'll be sure to share my listening impressions with members on this thread.  It'll be my first review so "there goes nothing", "break a leg" & all that kind of stuff.   Again, thanks to all of you who have given me feedback/your impressions which helped me decide in the end.  I'm sure it will turn out to be a good decision. Edited by Old Groucho - 6/26/13 at 10:56pm .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

Pez, glad you're enjoying the HD650 I agree with your statement about them being more fun and a better all rounder because that is exactly there main characteristic/quality.  You also point out that you have been listening to them for 3 hours straight = the HD650's other great quality : non fatiguing.  I read somewhere on Head-fi (can't remember which thread) a member stating that he found that one of the problems with more expensive elite headphones is that they have a specific sound signature ie. the HD800's signature is it's emphasis on excessive treble IMHO.  I agree with those that point out that the HD800 needs a specific amplifier/DAC to bring out it's best but that can become an expensive & sometimes non ending quest, again IMHO but also from experience.  The HD650 will always do well with an amplifier/DAC combination that meets it's high impedance demand; that's when the HD650's magic all round sound signature reveals itself. Previously hidden or subdued little background mid-range instrumental sounds reveal themselves, pop out of "left field" so to speak in all clarity & that's when the grin appears on the listener's face & you realize that this is indeed a special headphone.  A couple of years ago I bought the HD800 & naively sold my first pair of HD650.  After a while I realized that I truly missed my HD650s & bought them again & eventually got tired of it's more expensive sibling & got rid of them = went full circle & now am quite happy with what I have. Again to all followers of this thread & for the last time I apologize for writing about the HD650 on this thread & will refrain from doing so from now on. I agree with your observations pez which seem to indicate that this pairing (HD650 & A2) appears to have excellent synergy resulting in a good listening experience at a reasonable price which in the end is what this post should be/is all about.Edited by Old Groucho - 6/27/13 at 7:13am

Hodgjy is pretty spot on, but I still have a bias that the A2 is a somewhat bright amp.  Not overly so, but enough to notice on certain headphones.
 
Of course, my bias in this case is with the HD 650 as I'm enjoying them more, but from a somewhat unbiased point of view:
 
The HD 600 is the more analytical, cold sounding of the pair.  It makes me think, quite literally: "If people call the HD 600 and 650 'warm' and 'dark' sounding, and the AKG K701 'neutral' in comparison, then I'd absolutely hate the AKGs."  So if a more analytical sound is what you want, the HD 600 is better for you.  If you want a slightly warmer sound, less rolled off bottom end (with a nice bit of punch, mind you), and just a headphone you can throw anything at, the HD 650 are for you.  The A2 does great with both headphones and I find the synergy to be fantastic with both pairs.  It just literally boils down to preference.  I honestly would have probably never tried the HD 650s before upgrading again had I not come across the deal that I did.  Needless to say, I'm very glad I did.

I ordered an Asgard 2 yesterday. I'm not too worried about the backorders (as per getting your unit at least), but don't be surprised if they don't get them out for another month.
 
I had to wait almost two months for my backordered Bifrost to come in. Ordered it mid December and it wasn't shipped until late January. They had some real issues updating the website or giving a shipping time; they delayed the backorders three times. Emailing them wasn't much help either, all I got were vague replies that didn't include a date...
 
Schiit is good at some things, but they are really bad at keeping touch with consumers when there's backorders. I found it hilarious how (with my BIforst) they said that they were going to ship on a certain date, and then three days after that date (and no unit shipped) they updated website to be a date that was two weeks in the future.

Hey all,
 
Sorry for the continued backorders. I think we've gotten a pretty good handle on things, with the exception of the Asgard 2.
 
As far as us being inaccurate as far as expected delivery dates, we've been really, really, really clear about the shipping date being an estimate. As in, guess. As in, might not make it. As in, if you need something right away, you might want to order something else, or something from another company. 
 
Why is it an estimate, and why is it frequently inaccurate? To understand this, you need to know a few things about the production process. We don't have a line of 50,000 magic fairies hand-carving aluminum and spinning resin into PCBs. We are 100% reliant on our subcontractors, and if they slip, we slip. We base our delivery estimates on theirs. And guess what? Frequently they are wrong. Here's a tiny list of things that can change the shipping date:
 
1. The metal shop sends us junk chassis. Unfortunately, this is what we have been fighting most lately. They screw up, and it's 8 weeks to get it sorted. Period. 
2. The PCB assembly house says they'll deliver in one week, and it ends up being two. Sometimes things slip.
3. The transformers are late. This has happened plenty of times. Sometimes many weeks late.
4. Some small part holds us up, something even as simple as capacitors or input connectors.
5. Internally, we have to devote more time to a different product, to ensure it's on-time because it's more critical (out of stock longer.)
6. We think the assembly house has begun production, and they are simply shipping first articles. 
7. We screw up and miscalculate.
 
Whenever we change a delivery date, the estimated shipping date is updated in orders and on the site. So, you'll be emailed with order status whenever something changes. Asking us for more info will result in a curt answer, because we don't know anymore than you do. 
 
The current run of Asgard 2 has been hung up for metal, and for boards. Boards are supposed to start coming in next week. Of course, that can change. 
 
Hopefully this helps clear things up.
 
All the best,
Jason

I got my new switches to try and fix my damaged one and put them in a few minutes ago.  Nothing....
 
The volume knob makes some scratchy sound for the first 5-10% of a turn, and then there is no sound 
 
Oh well, it at least  I gave it a try, pretty disappointed....
 
***UPDATE***
 
Well I decided to hook it up to my SACD Player and see what happens, I was only using an iPod Nano to test it out and I have sound! It is in the scratchy part of the volume knob rotation and it is low, but it is pretty clear and goes away when I turn on "low gain" mode, but them if i turn it all the way up it makes some noise, with pops, but it makes noise. So...maybe I need to replace the volume knob as well? Hum....maybe the patient can be saved yet!

Hey guys,
 
1st of all i i just want to point out that I m new to the HiFi world (meaning: i have bought my 1st ever avr one month back)
 
I have been looking for a headphone amp since i will want to be able to "work" (by that i am reffering to gaming and random flac music listening) on the computer... when the avr will be playing something (loud) from another source (eg: the xbox or the cable/sat)
 
If i m not mistaking too much (from having read this thread and the 7 reviews on amazon) the A2 (A $$ Guard II) is a solid amp for non-30$ headphones. 
At the moment i have a pair of Sennheiser HD 598 and one ATH-M50RD ... (and am planning on getting an AKG-x701... to complete a trio)
 
Having said all of the above i m kindly asking you (the experienced headphone geeks) to share some beginner tips before placing an order with Jason.

The A2 will be a great choice.  It presents the signal with all the characteristics that a  very good amp of this type should provide.   That is:  It takes away none of the signal (It's flat freq. response goes far beyond human hearing, both low and high),  it adds nothing to the signal (noise and distortion),  it makes the signal bigger only (exactly what an amp is suppose to do, AMPLIFY.  Part of my life, transistors only existed in the laboratory and every thing electronic was tube.  Be glad that a good looking, well built transistor amp at a reasonable price exists.
 
If you decide on the A2 then you can work on not having your wallet emptied by people that want to sell you unbelievably overpriced cables or power cords, and other such crap. Just have, reasonably priced, quality cables so you can afford really good headphones that sound the way you want.
 
I will get that expensive power cord  with "Hyperdrive and extra Woo Woo" when the power company starts using silver transmission lines.
 
Good Luck
 
P.S.:  Looking over what I typed, I have decided to edit to emphasize that, I read your post closely, and should point out that this amp is compatible with your current phones, and will be with almost any phones out there.

"The amp should (in theory or to my imagination) automatically adjust its output power according to the plugged in headphones."
 
This is usually not a problem with transistors.  Tubes however have a high output impedance generally and need special provisions for driving lower resistances like speakers and low impedance headphones.  This is usually accomplished with transformers for the tube output.  Good transformers cost good money.  You would also need a good switch to change transformer taps to handle the various range of impedances plug-ed into a single headphone  jack (low, medium, high, impedance phones).
 
 
"How strong/sturdy is the front jack ?"
 
????
 
About as strong as any other amp that you can buy.
 
It's well built.
 
P.S.  I am not anti tube.  They have considerable value for certain reasons.  I was just explaining the answer to the versatility/adjustment question you posed.  But tubes can also pose headaches.

My comment about 'best' was to point out that it is your decision as to what is best for you.  Someone telling you that amp X is best for you does not really mean much, other than they think it is best for you.  Ultimately it is up to you to listen to it and make your own determination as to what you like.
 
Like I said earlier I am being mister technical today for some reason (my engineers brain working overtime maybe?).  I just had to speak up because the tubes thing and needing switches thing seemed to confuse the issue. The switches are not even needed for tube amps either which makes it even more troubling. but that is for another thread.....
 
Anyway,
 
I am very happy with the A2 and use it for desktop amp service as well as pre-amp for my Stax rig.  It all comes back to what you are looking for.
Next you might consider getting a dedicated DAC like the Bifrost.

I would make sure that the headphone jack you are using is coming from the sound card and not the onboard sound (from the motherboard).  Don't know what your computer is so this may not be an issue...
 
In my case I have three different places to connect headphones, one from the card itself on the back of the computer, one from a break out box from the sound card mounted in a drive bay, and one integral to the case that is connected to the motherboard.  Each one of these uses a different set of circuitry to drive the headphones.  I modded my soundcard with higher quality caps and different opamps and therefore I amp connected directly to the soundcard with one set of headphones.  But I use external DAC/Amp for other headphones.
 
It all comes back to what your system from source to ears needs to make you happy.

As far as cables go...
Monster (like Dr Dre Beats) are overrated and overpriced products.
I d rather buy from a company that is spending more on the production process than on marketing/advertisement.
From what i ve learned so far : if the core of the cable is ofc , has a good build and has gold plated tips = you good to go. 
Spending as much as 500$ for one cable is just... excentric.
 
My pc's Asus Xonar Dx audiocard... is a fdd power supplied pci-e card. It s main output is used to connect to the assignable optical input of the avr. Thus... the front audio jack is connected to the motherboard, but the system (windows audio panel) referrs to it as an Asus Xonar Headphone connection. 
 
PS. I have read that some of you have purchased the A2 and have shipped it to Europe. Do you still get the same 5 year warranty or ... not ? (I am also living/working overseas ... and i wouldn t want to have to travel back to the states for warranty issues)

I need a little advice, in the fall I will be getting a laptop and getting rid of my desktop.  With that being said my current amp/dac (Asus STX) will be going with it.  So I need an actual amp/dac setup and I am strongly considering the Asgaard 2 and Bifrost.  I currently have a pair of Grado 325i's (and A900's that don't get touched), I will also be purchasing a pair of RS1i's in the same time frame.  I'm also looking into Little Dot MK V + DAC_1 (I like things to match lol).
 
My question is, which combo would be the better upgrade over the STX?  I mostly listen heavy metal/thrash/etc.  I love how aggressive the Grados sound and from what I read the solid states are going to be more up my ally.  I also want to eventually invest in a turn table and vinyl setup, will I be able to simply plug in the turn table into the amp directly?  I have never even listened to vinyl through headphones but have heard great things about it.

According to the specs I found on Crutchfield's legacy listing for your receiver, looks like you do have line-level stereo audio output for a second zone. Problem is, this zone will only accept analog sources. I think this prevents you from using the Onkyo's DAC, since you need to feed your AVR an analog signal (i.e., one that's native analog or has already been through a DAC) to play it through to Zone 2.
 
What you would need, but appears you don't have, is a pre-out (output from your AVR's integrated preamplifier that skips its integrated power amplifier and feeds an outboard power amplifier such as your headphone amplifier instead). Although, even if you did have the pre-out, you'd have to reckon with the redundant preamplifier in the A2, but that's a moot point for your situation. 
 
I have a similar AVR, but I use my A2 to power a separate desktop rig. Occasionally, I will port the laptop and DAC up to my "home theater" room and feed the AVR with them—sort of the opposite of what you want to do (and I don't use headphones in that scenario). 
 
Sorry, but I don't think you can pull this off.

I just had to share :] I'm using Audioquest USB Forest cables and PYST for the RCA's. I like how short of a signal path I'm getting to my headphones :] very linear and warm sounding considering I have DT880s.
 
I recently upgraded to the Schiit Bifrost Uber and I've noticed much more texture and detail to the highs as well as a very large soundstage with great imaging of instruments and proximity. Listening to Radiohead - Amnesiac in 24 bit FLAC was quite an experience with the counter being And Justice for All - Metallica which blew my mind. One of my favorite FLACs at the moment is  96khz 24-bit Alt-J An Awesome Wave. A very awesome wave indeed :] .. that is a sound wave.

I own an Asgard 2 and It is a really clean sound, clinical almost, I listened to a hybrid tube amp and like the sound of the hybrid tube amp better, I would guess the lyr will be warmer since tubes tend to be, which is why I like the hybrid tube amp more, the Asgard 2 has a hi and low gain switch, I don't think the lyr does
I was thinking about buying the Valhalla or the lyr but the Valhalla Jason from Schiit said would sound really tubey with the grados, the lyr was out of my price range so I didn't ask on it
What headphones will you be using ?
I am using grado sr225i
If it helps any Schiit is the sh!t, in regards to answering questions quickly and Jason himself usually answers them, they shipped my amp the same day they received payment, and it is very well packed, the owners manual is kind of hilarious  Schiit has a 15 day trial/ return period if that helps any, I recommended there magni to my cousin since he is looking for a cheap headphone amp, and would recommend SchiitEdited by autoguy - 8/3/13 at 10:19pm

Hey guys, Sorry it took me so long (to brag about my new Schiit), but i ve been busy (or lazy).
 
In the next few lines/photos i will tell you about my experience with the Schiit :D
 
I received the A2 pretty fast. The packaging had a few scuffs but i think it s only because it had to travel such a long way (from US to UAE)
 

 
 
I ve emailed Jason about the status of the package... and promised to update as soon as i had time to open it / set it up / test it.
 
I did not know that inside i would find a big/strong/buff (pvc) sponge casing on the amp.
 

 
 
Since inside... everything was NOT damaged... i went ahead and removed all parts from the plastic bags. 
 

 
 
I also asembled the mini rubber legs/stands on the bottom 
 

 
 
Ok...
 
Everything was ready to go... 
I Just plugged in the power cord... and the monoprice audio cable (the brand is mentioned on the schiit website) which is connected to the pc's front audio jack (i explained how on asus rog forum)
 

 
 
Sound wise... everything is clear as day... very detailed... simply "awesome" (i play lossless audio files... most of the time)
 
Heat wise... yes the amp gets hot... but not enough to scar me for life :P
 
I would like to mention that (currently) i am using the Schiit on Low Gain with the volume knob turned only 1/3 of it s full power.
 
I don t use High Gain and more volume... because i just don t want to become deaf.
 
That s my design. That s my story. That s it.

I really do like the A2, its a great bargain for what I paid for it, its really nice for a sub $300 amp. I have also mentioned that this is my first solid state headphone amp so I say again, maybe it is the solid state sound in general I dont care for??
 
I have yet to hear any of the other Schiit amps but I recall one review a while back that said that the Asgard was "warmer" sounding then the Valhalla but couldnt touch what the Lyr had to offer. I have the WA2 and have a Crack coming next week so I dont need another tube amp so odds are I may never get to compare the models against each other.
 
I am most likely keeping my A2, it really shines in the one area that my WA2 does not and that is with music that is just not recorded well. And also it seems to play well with a lot of different cans and thats a big one for me as I want to start trying some different models from the Senns.
 
One other thing, Schiits customer service is right up there with Jack Woo and David ZheZhe, and thats a very important thing to remember as well.

I have to agree with Jason. I have my Asgard 2 paired with an Uberfrost and I'm running re-cabled DT880s to my Schiit. My DT880s used to sound thin and bright like many people suggest when they are underamped since I used to run them from a soundcard. They have much fuller mid-bass, slightly than warmer than neutral tonality, extremely detailed and well imaged highs, and plenty of air and instrument separation.
 
Let's just say my DT880s don't sound like the cans that they used to be. They have huge bass impact that really digs deep for a set of open cans. Asgard 2 and Uberfrost fixed all the problems that I used to have with my DT880s.
Let me remind you that I have burned them in for over 500 hours.
 
Thank you Jason and the rest at Schiit for bringing me an end-game solution under $1000. Truly, you must hear it to believe it before you base your options off of some people's opinions.

I am running 250ohm Beyers to my Schiit stack. There is a huge debate about the 250ohm vs 600ohm Beyers as far as sound quality goes. I can tell you one thing from experience and research, the 600ohm's require more to sound better which is why they need an OTL (output transformerless) amp to get enough watts. I believe the 250ohms will have better synergy just based on the statistics that Schiit provides on their website about mW/impedance level.
 
The general consensus about the 600 ohm vs 250 ohm is that they sound almost identical when amped properly. I think recabled DT880s will sound better than stock cabled DT880s no matter what impedance they are. I'd take a gander that my DT880 250ohms sound better than stock 600ohms just because I have a better signal path. Things such as cables are considered non-variables to the non-believers, but anyone with experience knows that anything that gets in the way of the signal path will make a difference.
 
So I believe the 250 ohm Beyers make an excellent match with the Asgard 2 and Uberfrost. I do believe the 600ohm Beyers would be more suited by an OTL such as the Little dot MKIV or Bottlehead Crack OTL. No experience with 32ohm DT880s but they usually aren't part of the debate because they were intended for usage with an ipod

Like the Magni, the Asgard is a lot of amp for IEMs. The selectable gain on the v2 Asgard will help; however, the IEMs don't need anywhere close to the 1W of power---even most full size headphones will be painfully loud with Asgard maxed out.
 
Why don't you look into the O2 amplifier. You can pair it with the Modi (which I think is an excellent DAC) for a $230 set up that can power almost any headphone, but without the risk of melting your IEMs if you bump the volume knob.
 
The O2 would give you selectable gain and a low noise floor which would be excellent for your IEMs.
 
The extra $120 you save you could put toward more music, a new pair of headphones, etc..
 
Like the Magni, the Asgard will work with IEMs, although IEMs are not the primary design application. You have to ask yourself what exactly you want---if you want the best amplifier for your IEMs, then the high powered amps built for orthos aren't your first choice. If you want an amp for pushing a pair of HE-500s in the future, then Magni, Asgard 2 (high gain), or O2 (high gain) would all be excellent choices for your first setup.
 
Cheers!

Hey all,
 
Just to clear this up: actually, Asgard 2 is an *exceptional* IEM amp. With a low gain of 1.5 and a much, much better volume pot (in terms of both low-level tracking and more gradual taper), you have tons of control for IEMs, as well as a dead-quiet noise floor. It's not "the low gain will help," it's "the low gain was designed almost specifically for IEMs."
 
And, as an added bonus, you have the power when you need it for less efficient headphones, as well as preamp outs if you want to add desktop powered monitors or drive a speaker amp. Asgard 2 is really a do-all amp. It's not just a high-power amp, it's not just an "ortho amp," it is perfect for a full range of headphones, from IEMs to orthos.
 
Go ahead. Try it yourself--and I bet you'll find that Asgard 2 offers even better IEM performance in terms of volume pot range and low-level tracking than any amp using small volume pots such as found in Magni. You simply can't get the same gradual taper and low-level tracking on a 9mm pot as a 25mm pot. 
 
Not trying to be combative; just giving it to you from the designers' perspective.
 
All the best,
Jason

vl4dimir,
 
About 8 months ago I was in the same boat:  O2/ODAC looked very attractive for the price, quality capability, but when comparing to a BiFrost Uber + Asgard2 
felt the Schiit was a much better "long term" purchase.
Why?
 
I'll let the experts compare clear/transparent audio qualities, but if I re-read the specs:
 
1.  Asgard2 has higher output possible 1W compared to 612mW of the O2.
this is important if you end up purchasing non IEM headphones with higher resistance or power requirements.
thus, my HE-500s are being driven very well by Asgard2.  O2 likely a bit underpowered for the HE-500s.
that being said, Asgard2 on low gain is still perfect for IEMs IMHO.  
 
2.  wanted 1/4 headphone jack and not mini 3.5mm jack of the O2.
 
3.  wanted upgradability and a long warranty.  BiFrost and Asgard2 has BOTH in spades.
 
4.  wanted more inputs than USB.  BiFrost big win there.
 
5.  wanted pre-amp for potential near-file audio monitor speakers one day.  Asgard2 bingo, RCA audio out.
 
Summary:
Your features (now and future) might be different, but
I didn't want to buy the O2/ODAC only to upgrade "a few months later" for the features above, hence I went all in and will be using the BiFrost Uber + Asgard2 for years with little musical interruption.
Well, at least until Jason pulls another affordable audio rabbit out of his top hat!
 
Good Luck!

Just picked up a used Asgard 2 this week from another head-fier to replace my O2. This is a great headphone amp.
I do like the sound a little better than the O2 (using an ODAC), and it definitely has more headroom. 
I also like the larger volume knob and headphone jack; the O2 controls and plugs feel so cramped. Downside is that I do wish the power button was on the front. I know people like the cleaner look, but I favor usability. If the power switch is going to be on the back, I prefer the black plastic switches like Audio-GD uses on their NFB model. It's a little easier to feel/find on the back.
I'm also using the pre-amp out with an Indeed TA2021 t-amp and Ascend Acoustics CBM-170 SE speakers. Seems like because the pre-amp is analog, it is warming up the sound a little. It's nice. However, it also appears to be consuming a lot of power in pre-amp out mode. Still gets warm. Sort of detracts from the energy efficiency of the t-amp. LOL

I got a B Stock from Schiit on Amazon for $199 + $16 shipping.  When I got it there was some slight marks on the front, one noticeable one near the headphone port.  But all in all for $50 savings, I am very happy.  It also includes the same 5 Year Warranty, which is pretty important to me.  I am running an Ipod Touch 3g(320k files) > Pure 20 Dac > Asgard 2 > Hd 650 and I can hear a big improvement over a E17 that I was using before the Asgard 2 came in.  I also have the following Headphones to try out - Fidelio X1 and Amperior.  For IEMS I have a Grado GR10 - I am dying to test on the lo gain with these. 
 
For the Preamp I have an old Fisher Home Stereo that I will be using.  It is not the greatest system but will work for the time being.  I plan on upgrading to the AudioEngine A5+ in the future. 
 
I almost bit on a Asgard V1 as they sell in the $130 - $150 range on the Bay, but I'm glad I went with my gut and spent a lil more on the V2.

Just got my A2.  Only been listening for about an hour, but first impressions are:  Great detail, not overly bright.  Very nicely built, no transformer hum issues, and output is silent with full gain and no input (always a good sign).  I can hear the slightest of hum if I press my ear against the case, but only then.  This is completely fine, and is not indicative of any problems.  My setup is FLAC -> uDAC 2 -> Asgard 2 -> HD 650.  The Asgard appears to have plenty of power to drive these headphones to ear splitting levels.  I prefer the low gain setting.
 
Pros:
+Excellent build quality
+Thing looks great
+It will keep my hands warm on a cold day
+Detailed sound, but not overly bright
+Excellently balanced potentiometer minimal channel imbalance even when nearly off
 
Cons:
+Bass impact seems a little low, but that might just be the HD 650 isn't known for crazy bass
 
Overall, I love this little amplifier already, and if it holds up, I would see no reason to replace it :)
 
Good job Schiit, as a fellow engineer, I am impressed with the build quality, price, and performance.  Keep on making great products!!!

Yeah probably not and I know USB cables aren't going to improve the sound etc unless the old cable is REALLY bad or defective. I've actually had a USB cable die once. Didn't think that was possible.
I'm really questioning this Belkin cable. It's a 3 footer too. The USB hub was also a Belkin!
 
I really like to try things out for myself. I don't mind paying $30 for a better built USB cable with good shielding that will last for 10 years+
I bet with a fancy $30 cable my USB drive speeds will improve by at least 20MB/sec! Kidding...
 
I haven't really heard any difference between interconnect cables since I had the HRT MSII DAC but the one I just bought at Wal-Mart (GE brand) today is no good. Sounds like poop with the Asgard 2. Could be placebo or whatever. (FIXED: interference to USB from ethernet. Poor shielding on cable made it worse?)
I actually had to go out and buy a new cable with dual RCA jacks on both ends due to a new amp. Forgot about that. I usually buy cheap Mogami or Monoprice stuff. Whatever has good shielding.
 
Guess I won't need a new USB cable now. Found a really thick clear one where you can see all the metal shielding inside it. I really dislike USB. I think if I get the Bifrost it will be the version with optical connection only.
 
Why the heck is the Asgard 2 fixing faults with my setup! I didn't ask you to do that danggit!
 
EDIT:
 
Sometimes with the Asgard2 I'm getting all confused. Some music sounds really blurry/muffled with the Q701. My only idea is that the Asgard2/Modi combo is just more revealing of how bad each recording is. I don't know. The modded Q701 does this more often too. Bad recordings might even sound worse on the Asgard 2 compared to my Micro Amp. I don't mean harsh/bright recordings but ones that are just low bit-rate or not clear at all. Of course it still could be the Asgard 2 that is muffled, but I don't think so 
 
Some ambient music sounds good but is just so muffled on nearly any setup.
 
Haha maybe the Asgard 2 is more transparent than we give it credit for.

Remember, I mean POWERED USB hub. So the DAC is getting extra power from the wall.
Well, when I first got my HRT MSII I connected it to my laptop's USB port.
When i'd scroll up and down in windows I'd get pops/clicks and weird noises. Then randomly I'd get screeching through my headphones until I yanked the cable.
I even tried switching ports without any luck.
I think the ports were just underpowered (USB 2.0 still) and really poor quality.
 
When I switched to a powered USB hub all those noises and screeching vanished. The sound also seemed more smooth and don't ask me how. I know it's all 1s and 0s etc
 
On a desktop it's less of an issue. My laptop was an HP. It's still going today and built like a tank but it's USB ports are awful.
 
My trust of USB ports is so bad now because of that laptop that I nearly always use a powered HUB. Using the DAC without one and so far so good.
 
I have noticed degraded sound when using too long of a USB cable (6 feet+) but let's not derail the thread with that...
 
EDIT:
 
BTW you know what's also stupid? I use a laptop hard drive on my laptop or blu-ray player with a 6" USB cable and it powers up just fine. I lose the original cable and try a longer one and it just clicks and not enough power to spin up! What the heck? I'm no technical guru but this is weird! One USB drive I have is so power hungry that it required two USB connections. It's only a laptop drive.
 
I think what I need to get is an internal USB CARD. I have a good motherboard too. MSI and not too old.

WOW! This has been driving me bonkers. The Asgard2 would randomly sound really bad...
 
You wouldn't believe what i've had to do so far to get it to sound good..nearly all day back and forth.
 
First I thought it was a bad powered USB hub so I connected it straight to the computer. PERFECT! Fixed.
Bought a new RCA cable and then it sounded awful again. What the heck?
Tried another with good shielding. Fixed! Well..nope not really. Shielding maybe made it sound that way.
I tried to use those crappy cables I thought were the problem and it sounded GOOD!! Annoying..
 
So I move my USB cable up one row on the back of the PC. BINGO!
 
Want to know what it was? USB port too close to my ethernet jack that was in use!
Now fingers crossed this was 100% the problem. Both ports are USB 2.0. I need to block one off.
This is probably why my USB hub sounded broken.
 
Want to know what the Asgard2 sounded like with this issue?
 
Background details would almost magically go distant and sound like they had no weight to them. Like lifeless. What?! How?!
Mids really thin..no life to them. This is what gave me an impression of it sounding WAAAAY too relaxed and laid back.
Soundstage was really weird and imaging seemed off like I was struggling to pinpoint things.
Strangely the sound was smooth. Too smooth. Seemed like everything lacked clarity and detail.
 
So basically viewing Head-Fi ruined the sound of my Asgard2.  
 
EDIT: What I don't get is that I swear I used the same port (next to ethernet jack) with my Micro Amp and no such issues. Maybe my Micro Amp filters crap better. Doubt it.
Maybe poor shielding on the cables used for the Asgard 2 made it worse.
 
I think this might be some serious competition for my favorite Micro Amp. The O2 was the closest i've come to matching that. The Micro (like the Asgard2) has smoother treble. The Asgard2 might even have smoother treble than even my Micro Amp.  I'm really a huge fanboy of that amp and wouldn't sell it for even $600 when they're sold out. Asgard 2 definitely sounds neutral. Really liking it's treble.
 
Using the modded Q701 and sounds good (when my DAC is not attached to a bad port!). Maybe i'll actually try the HD-650 on it tomorrow..
 
Basically the Asgard 2 just sounds like my Modi at the moment. Ugh, sorry guys. But the Modi is awesome so that's a good thing! You need a $250+ amp to really hear it at it's best!! Ok, maybe I made that up.  Not sure if I could pass a blind test between the Asgard 2 and Micro + upgraded PS (with the Q701). For the song I'm listening too right now I got all confused there for a second and thought I was listening to my other amp. Whoops. Both sound pretty transparent and musical

You should give it another chance sometime.
Yeah IMO that's coming from the Magni and not the Modi. The Modi doesn't really have such a sound to my ears. Not even close. I did hear that with the Magni. The Modi doesn't sound bright/thin at all and that's after maybe 6-8 months of use.
The only way I can get it to sound thinner is to compare it to my E17. E17 has a very subtle touch of warmth. The Modi/ODAC even seem more transparent than the O2 itself! Ok it sounds weird saying that!
 
When I compared the Modi to the ODAC with the Headroom Micro it's was incredibly hard for me to hear any difference at all. With that amp it's usually easy to hear DAC changes (if they have any coloration).
My brain kept saying "Oh, this ODAC sounds clearer" but then it could have been placebo. The difference was much smaller than the difference between the HRT MSII and ODAC. That was stupid easy to hear the differences there.
 
I think the Modi might really require a different/better amp than the Magni to hear it at it's best.
 
The only major thing that stuck out for me was that the Modi sounded like it had slightly better soundstage depth, but people tell me this is impossible! Or wait..they also say that the Modi is not transparent if there is a difference. Nonsense!
 
TL;DR:
 
Both the ODAC and Modi sound very transparent to me. Modi just sounded slightly better to me. The soundstage depth on the ODAC sounds weird at times. It felt like everything in the center position was coming from one single spot in front of me. Nearly always the same. Any change in distance was much harder to hear. Don't know what on earth was causing this and most would overlook it. Maybe the Modi has less treble (and bass) extension to make some things seem like they have more depth in the recording, but I doubt it.
 
To me they're both equally good and I'd be happy with either one. I'd maybe fail a blind test. Pretty sure of it unless I tested these things. I got the same results with all my headphones.

Yep..mostly with tracks that have a large soundstage and some recordings that are fairly warm.
The biggest difference is when I listen to the Buena Vista Social Club CD.
I have maybe a playlist of a few dozens tracks i've memorized so I can test things.
 
With the "bad" USB port that whole CD is just thin and lifeless.
I wanted to think that this was normal but it's definitely not. Sounds really bad and makes me not like the Asgard 2 at all.
 
I actually don't know if the port is really bad or if it's caused by some sort of interference from the ethernet jack or poor shielding.
Maybe it's just a combo of poor shielding on the USB and RCA cables that make it so bad.
 
I ordered some Monoprice USB cables with a ferrite core and will get a USB card. Right now it's sounding great so I don't want to make it worse again!
 
What I should do is swap USB cables again on the bad port and see if it's caused by poor USB shielding. Would be interesting. Hardly seems possible!
 
Maybe it improves when the ethernet jack is not in use

I would like to try the ODAC again. Honestly sometimes it's hard to really know an amp or DACs true sound until i've used it for at least 6 months. I did maybe a few hours of ODAC/Modi comparisons. It was so tough!
It took me quite a long time to figure out the Magni and my Micro Amp. For the longest time I kept describing my Micro Amps "sound" when it was just my DAC's colorations (HRT MSII). I learned my lesson there.  
 
Right now I suggest the O2+Modi to people. Sounds weird and an ugly combo but I like it. O2 still seems like it has a hint of brightness in the treble (barely audible) with the Q701 but some said it might be due to a weaker wall wart. Doubt it.
Not really a fan of the Magni with the Q701 for some reason. It wasn't terrible and kind of OK sometimes. I'd probably use that combo with a warmer source like the E17. O2 sounds smoother than the Magni, but the Micro/Asgard 2 is even better!
 
Actually I have zero problems suggesting the Magni for a Sennheiser or whatever. I know some love it with brighter headphones but I'm just too dang picky.
 
Despite it being somewhat colored I still like the Fiio E9! You can even find that for sometimes around $75. I don't know why but hearing DAC changes on that thing is a million times harder than it is on my Micro Amp (and probably the O2/Asgard2)

FYI if anyone is curious my issues were definitely caused by some sort of interference.
I used the same bad port with a better shielded USB cable (it's VERY heavy and thick and has foil shielding) with two large ferrite beads and it was perfect. I also had to use better shielded interconnect cables (don't know if that helped).
 
I then tried my older Belkin cable and attached two ferrite beads and it sounded a little better but not really sure. That could be my brain imagining things.
 
So I need to plug my DAC into the USB port that's furthest away from the ethernet jack.
For best results I also need a really well shielded USB and RCA cable.
 
This is crazy...I wonder what it is that's causing that? My computer's power supply is really good.
 
I hear no noise from the Asgard 2 when play is stopped.
 
After I removed those ferrite beads from the USB cable (I don't even know if they would actually do anything if they're attached to the outside?) it seemed to be fine for a few minutes and then later got worse without changes.
 
So all those issues were a random occurrence when connected to the port closest to the Ethernet jack.
 
Pretty cool how I can hear all these things with the Modi and Asgard 2.
 
BTW I never knew how huge of an effect such noise/interference could have on sound quality! Pretty amazing. Seems I learned something new today. Still wish I knew why I don't hear it on my other amp.
 
EDIT:
 
Ugh..guess it's back to a powered USB hub maybe until I get a USB card. Whenever I crank the Asgard 2 up high I can hear static when I scroll up and down in Windows  Has to be at like 70% volume though.
I guess my PC is a noise monster.
 
Removed $4 GE RCA cables and noise was reduced a little but still not good enough.
 
This is what I used to be 100% noise/interference free on any volume level with the Q701, Modi and Asgard2:
 
Powered USB port hub with it attached to port furthest away from ethernet jack. Thick clear USB cables with two ferrite beads and metal shielding. I don't trust ferrite beads on USB for some reason.
$9 Ge Ultra Pro RCA cables with metal shielding (they're clear so you can see it). Monoprice ones have good shielding too. Don't get the thinner car audio version. The shielding is much worse.
 
The PC is not some random piece of junk so I'm surprised about all this.
 
Kind of like how some amps find faults in my setup even if it's small. The O2, Micro and Asgard 2 did this. The Asgard 2 seems to suffer the most from noise/interference.  I had that problem with the Magni too. Asgard 2 supposedly has tons of noise filtering.

This thing sure seems like a complete noise magnet just like the Magni. I guess it has filtering inside or whatever. The O2 and my Micro were always dead silent and didn't have such weird issues. I think my system is actually fine because with two others amps there is no problem.
 
Today I was trying the HD-650 for several hours with both the Asgard 2 and Micro Amp + Astrodyne.
Micro sounds much more clear, spacious and airy sounding yet it's still full sounding and not thinner. Yeah and that's with the HD-650! On the Asgard 2 it's more blurry/fuzzy sounding but still pretty good. Almost like a thin layer of something over the sound in comparison. This was on Tony Bennett recordings where he sounds like he's singing in a bar/club. There is some air in the recording but mostly not audible with the Asgard2 for me. The differences are not like night and day and kind of subtle. Micro seems a little more detailed but not quite sure. The overall "sound signature" seems pretty similar but the Asgard 2 seems just a tad darker (but certainly not a dark amp!).
 
Basically right now it sounds good but not great. Sounds like a good quality $200-$250 amp. Sounds pretty relaxed, smooth and laid back sort of (still measuring flat). It doesn't seem to have a crystal clear sound or be super revealing and detailed. It makes sense why it would sound good with a DT-990 or a Grado. I really like it with the modded Q701 (which is a little bassier/fuller than normal).
 
I would say the Micro is similar to the A2 but with the crystal clear sound of the O2 mixed in and even smoother treble than what the O2 had. The Micro + Astrodyne sounds like a more refined and smoother sounding O2 to my ears.
 
The Micro Amp was $330 new and the Astrodyne usually goes for $60-$100. Hardly fair to compare them maybe. The Micro really is worth $330. Because of this is makes sense why the Micro might sound better. The Micro isn't just some weak overpriced portable amp to ME.
 
I want to compare the two for the next week but the Asgard 2 might be a keeper. It wouldn't be my first pick under $300 for the HD-650 though. Maybe 2nd but not sure. I actually did love the O2 with the HD-650. Yeah weird.
 
I do love how the Asgard 2 has pretty smooth treble. Theres a good chance I might prefer the Asgard 2 to the O2 but not sure yet. Asgard 2 definitely does sound neutral to me. I like it more than the Asgard 1 and not sure what changed. Maybe nothing but more jiggawatts! Kidding and I've read the comparisons to the A1.
 
Right now I have the Asgard 2 sitting very far away and isolated.  
 
I wonder how the Matrix M-Stage compares to the Asgard 2...

Well, it still sounds good with the HD-650 and really just comes down to preferences. I imagine the Asgard 2 should be fine for anything but not sure.
 
It's been a constant struggle to get the Asgard 2 to sound good. Don't know what the heck was going on. I'm now about 95% there is nothing wrong with my computer, USB ports or hub. I mean all my other amps are perfect.
 
Unlike my Micro Amp the Asgard 2 benefits from a surge protector with noise filtering.
 
I moved it about 4 feet away from my computer and monitor and so far so good. For best results I have to use cables with the best shielding I can find.
 
Yeah on the Asgard 2 I can actually HEAR a difference with RCA cables. Weird right?
 
Bizarre how there is no noise at all when I turn the volume up. I fixed that and it wasn't the problem.
 
This stupid thing has been driving me nuts!!
 
EDIT: I think this thing might be dead or dying because I just got random massive bass bloat. LOL great...

I think my Asgard 2 is defective. I'll triple check things tomorrow and try many sources that aren't USB. I will also try another computer.
 
I went to Radioshack to try two more random things before I go crazy. Bought a new interconnect cable and USB cable just for the heck of it. Didn't want to wait for my Monoprice order to arrive.
 
Everything sounded fine with the new RCA cable and then after 15 minutes all the life of the music got sucked out. Vanished. Then after awhile it comes back!
Randomly sounds like there is absolutely no fullness to anything.
 
Right now I'm listening to a Philip Glass song and it feels like i'm listening to it on a portable radio.
 
EDIT:
 
Out of nowhere I came up with this idea to disable some things in my BIOS. I disabled SpeedSTEP/EIST that regulates CPU speed depending on use. I also increased the Northbridge voltage a little.
It's now been 30 minutes and everything sounds good and no randomly degraded sound quality. With my luck it will probably screw up again later. I have a quad core Q6600 so its not too slow and old.
 
No idea how I have not heard this even once with my other amps. I've had that Speedstep thing active for maybe 4 months with zero problems.
 
Only change was swapping to a new Radioshack cable but the problem came back before I did the changes in the BIOS.
 
I also set Power Saving to "High Performance". I've always made sure to never ever put USB devices to sleep.

Oh no I definitely don't listen at random like that when comparing things. There is such huge variations in some songs so that's definitely a big no-no for me. I have a playlist with a bunch of songs I memorized. I really like to use good recordings with a large soundstage. I remember once when I was comparing the HD-600 and 650 I could barely hear any difference with some songs. With specific music it was easy.
 
I try to not compare when there is a song I haven't heard a million times.
 
With my main amp and the Q701 there are songs that sound like i'm listening to an AD700 and then the next sounds like i'm listening to an HD-650 
 
Sometimes I think when people criticize a specific headphones it's just the recordings fault! Like "vocals are too distant sounding" or "too harsh and tinny". Well I have recordings that sounds exactly like that on almost anything! I even have some junk with bloated bass IN the recording. That was nice of them!
 
Hmm, there's some bad recordings that actually sound 10x worse on the Asgard2. I mean the recording quality. One that sounds really bad is "Thin Air" from Pearl Jam. Not sure why it sounds so bad. It's 320kbps but sounds like 128kbps.

I tried the Asgard 2 with my Xbox 360 last night.
Setup was optical to E17 with amp disabled. The signal was then sent to the Asgard.
In Fallout 3 with the HD-650 everything was super full sounding and almost abnormally so. Like the bass was adding weight to EVERYTHING. It sounded like it had bass bleed. Huh?!
Low mids seemed too forward. I think E17 DAC + Asgard 2 is a bad combo for me. Strangely it sounded more normal with just the E17 and even the soundstage was larger!
The E17 isn't has a slight touch of warmth itself too. I guess the two together is like a double whammy in terms of warmth.
 
This morning I woke up and tried a docked Ipod Touch 2G to the Asgard for an hour. Everything was excessively warm and rather fuzzy sounding. The HD-650 sounded more veiled than ever before. Seemed darker than i've ever heard it.
The sound was congested, lacked detail and clarity. The Ipod Touch 2G was almost unrecognizable. It normally sounds thin/cold and sometimes bright.
 
So my Asgard 2 is either defective or extremely warm/congested. Right now it's like the warmest and most fuzzy sounding amp i've ever heard. Luckily it's a little better on my computer setup. I hope it's defective because it sounds pretty bad now.
 
It's possible everything is fine and maybe the Asgard 2 sound is not for me. I don't know why but it seemed to get warmer sounding after the first day. On day 1 it didn't really seem warm at all and really neutral.
I'm not going to mention anything about burn-in and I'm sure they do some at the factory. Let's not go there. 
 
Going to listen to it for a few hours today and try to not over-analyze things. I tried that earlier and it didn't work out. Hated most every minute of it.

Ok, so this is weird then. That's really good to know.
I sent it back today and they should get it on Thursday.
 
I really hope it's defective because I'm willing to give it another chance. If not than I guess I just don't like it. I'll feel sort of bad if it's 100% OK.
 
Like I said before..the first few days were good when it wasn't randomly sounding weird. Yet with the same exact setup the other amps were OK.
I must have posted a ton of random stuff on here and then I'd have to go back and remove them because somehow it had fixed itself. Felt like I was thread crapping with all my problems.
 
LOL I even cleaned my ears out and tried to make sure my HD-650 drivers didn't pop loose. 
 
On day two with the 650 it didn't sound all that dramatically different than my other amp (which is a good thing).

I thought maybe that it was some sort of weird interference or noise coming from my computer that was degrading the sound.
I think the problem kept changing from bad usb port to bad usb cable to bad RCA cable. I even ordered a new USB card thinking it was my computers fault.
 
It did seem to sound best when I had nothing but cables with thick shielding. Then of course the issue was so random that it probably didn't do a thing.
I even tried switching to different surge protectors and even directly to the wall.
 
The biggest weirdness was when randomly all the life of the music would be sucked out. Like everything went so dull/flat/boring. Like coming from a radio. I also experienced random changes in the bass quantity and how forward the low mids were too. Not due to the tracks. Now it's just flabby bass and lots of warmth. Much darker.

I have a few questions for you to better understand the situation. (I wish I could have responded before you shipped your Schiit back). First and foremost, if there is anything even slightly off, the guys at Schiitnwill take care of you, as they are incredible on the customer service end. I had to troubleshoot my Bifrost a while back, so I feel your frustration. I am hoping I can help clear up if you we're doing anything "wrong" on the PC side.
1) Is your PC overclocked?
2) Did you try different USB ports or just the one close to the Ethernet port?
3) Did your hook up your A2 to a non-digital source? (stereo, cd play, etc)
4) Did you try using different gain settings to see if that changed the sound?
5) What equipment do you currently have at the moment?
6) When your A2 sounded bad, was is in the middle of a sound/listening session? Or was is between songs or switching different headphones?
7) Do you listen to FLAC or other higher quality recordings?
Factors to consider:
My Asgard1 needs 45-60 minutes under load to warmup before it would sound its best. If you listened for a few hours, turned it off, and come back to re-listen... I wouldn't be surprised if you interpreted the sound that way. A cold Schiit sounds lifeless to my ears.
After upgrading, I noticed both more positives and more negatives in recordings. My Schiit stack gave me a sense of clarity and revealed many details that I may have missed otherwise. It also shows me when a recording is at fault. Bad recordings can easily detract from an enjoyable experience.
Playing around with Windows sound settings in the control center can alter the sound dramatically (and not in a good way)! By accidentally setting the sampling rate too high, the sound can sound mechanical and fake. Be sure to use recommended settings or test Wasapi/ASIO to get a true sound without Microsoft's programing interference. I am not suggesting that your problem is your DAC with limited infor, but make sure you can safely rule out that it is not DAC or software related first.
Troubleshooting can be very tiresome, but it's very easy to misjudge components without separating equipment and testing with some sort of control. I hope Schiit can shed some light on your situation, and hope it gets resolved quickly. But in the meantime, don't over think it, be sure to take time to enjoy the music. I noticed I wasn't having fun anymore when I kept A/B 10-15 second clips of songs to try to hear differences between cables or pads or tubes. Try not to second guess yourself or get too caught up with switching out cables every 5 minutes.
Good Luck

I'll try to be quick here so I don't flood the thread with a bunch of my problems. More impressions of the thing the better!
You wouldn't believe how many different things i've tried. I must have spent 6 hours and every combination of port, usb cable, interconnect cable etc. I basically wasted my whole Monday on this and I worked Sunday so I had it off.
At different times I thought it was interferences from the ethernet jack and then bad usb cable, port, RCA cable or noise coming from the wall. Turns out that after all this there is really nothing wrong with my system!
PC is not overclocked and I disabled any power saving features. With the same exact setup the E17 and Modi to my Micro Amp sound great! I also tried an Ipod Touch 2G docked, Clip+, Ipod Classic and two full sized CD players (Denon 1920/Oppo etc).
Tried using different gain settings. When listening to the Asgard 2 the first day I had it on for 6-7 hours straight. Day two I'm not sure really but I don't think it would have sounded this bad without warming up.
It sounded the worst on the Xbox 360 with E17 as a DAC. Never once in my life did I ever hear bass bleed with a headphone when playing Fallout 3. It was really bizarre.
 
So 50/50 chance it's bad. I thought maybe my ears were bad or something but my other system sounded perfect.
 
Oh and I also tried this bizarre idea of plugging it into a wall outlet that was further away from my PC. I even moved the A2 about 4 feet away from the PC just to be safe. I also tried two high quality surge protectors with filtering. Isobar and a Furman.
 
The sound randomly seemed to fade in and out, but then it'd sound great for awhile. This fading is very subtle at times.
 
Most of my tracks are 128kbps AAC. Kidding. They're mostly FLAC but a few 320kbps files. I honestly cannot hear a difference between the two but I haven't tried in maybe 3 years. Some bad recordings in FLAC can still sound like 128kbps files to begin with!
 
 
If it is 100% bad without any doubt I'm still willing to give it another try. I also don't think i've ever heard the Asgard 2 described as warm. Hmm, maybe it is to some? Usually its "dry". Supposedly the A1 is a little darker than the A2 but I don't know if that's true. The A2 on day 3 was definitely very warm sounding. I know the HD-650 is too but it seemed to make it even warmer than it already was.

Returned it on Tuesday. I don't know if they'll tell me if it's defective or just give me a refund.
I actually want to try again if it's bad. If it's not bad i'll feel really stupid. I don't want Schiit to waste too much time on my nonsense.
I didn't like the Asgard1 so I figured I'd give it another chance when the 2nd version came out. I thought maybe my DAC wasn't as good when I had the Asgard 1.
 
After I bought the Asgard 2 I sold my O2 just to recover my money. Should have kept it! 2nd best budget amp i've heard.
 
I don't know why I keep trying to find the PERFECT backup/bedroom amp. What's the point when it will probably only be used a few times a week..
 
Somedays I think even the E17 gets the job done well enough for that and it even has optical inputs for my Xbox 360.
 
One amp that looks perfect for that is the UHA-6S. It even has SPDIF input! An E17 on steroids would be perfect!

I felt the Magni was good at first but it's one amp that took me a good month to figure out. I also heard it the same way with the Q701. Keyword is "somewhat" which is important to point out and I agree with that.
I think it's a better match with darker/warmer sounding headphones but not everyone will agree. I did think it was pretty good with my 598 and DJ100.
 
I think the Magni + docked Ipod Touch 2G + Q701 was the worst combo i've ever heard. Touch 2G seems kind of bright too. Q701..not at all.
 
I actually liked the E9 more than the Magni for the Q701, but the O2 was better than both. E9 might be a bit more "musical" (and darker/smoother) with the Q701 but the O2 seems more accurate.
The O2 has has a hint of brightness in the treble with the Q701 (not like the Magni) and i've heard an upgraded AC adapter might help but I didn't get that far.
I rarely experienced it but I heard it when shooting different guns in Fallout 3 etc. Kind of ear piercing. the Q701 never sounds that way.
 
Wish I could have heard the A2 at it's best. Maybe it's just not for me..who knows..
 
LOL maybe my Asgard 2 needs 50+ before it sounds right. Nearly impossible and I don't believe in such things..

Really really hope my Asgard 2 was a lemon. I'm still looking forward to hearing a new one it if it was. Should know something within a few days I think.
I think Schiit is pretty busy so i'm going to be very patient!
 
Also, when comparing the ODAC and Modi it's usually best to do it on a very transparent amp like the O2 or Headroom Micro Amp. That way you don't hear any of the amp's colorations instead. When I compared them I had to switch from the Magni to the Micro. It was extremely hard for ME to hear any differences. Most of them could have been placebo and when it wasn't stupid easy to hear any differences I left them out of my review for them. For example, sometimes the ODAC sounded clearer but the difference was barely audible. Modi also didn't sound any warm/colder than the ODAC and no changes in tonality at all for me. NONE.
 
I'd gladly take either the ODAC or Modi. There was one thing I felt the Modi did better so I kept that and sold my ODAC. Modi is really amazing with the Micro Amp. It's really smooth and even more so than the O2 itself (huh?!). It's weird but the Modi and ODAC sound more transparent than the O2 and Magni!
 
O2 sounds like 97.9% transparent and the ODAC about 99%  You know I just say this kind of stuff to annoy people...oh and the Micro sounds about 100% transparent. I can't resist mentioning that amp whenever possible!
 
Even if I had a $500 amp i'd still be using the Modi.
 
BTW if it wasn't for the Modi i'd probably have never given the Asgard 2 a try. Right now i'm kind of a Modi and Micro Amp fanboy.
 
Someday i'll try the Bifrost too since it uses the same brand of chipsets as the Modi. This doesn't always mean much though. Not really sure how you could improve the Modi any further..

Yeah I tried a ton of other sources with similar results. Docked Ipod Touch 2G, E17 from Xbox 360 (optical) and a full sized CD player. I even tried a Clip+!
Strangely they all seemed to sound very similar which makes no sense. E17 from Xbox was the worst by far.  They all measure flat but yet it's pretty easy to hear the differences.
 
No chance of it being my PC's fault since every other amp and DAC combo is perfect. It was the same setup i've had for years. I've been using my regular amps since last Tuesday and no problems.
I spent 6+ hours troubleshooting my PC when there was never any problem to begin with. I even bought a USB card and got it in last week but there is no improvement or change in the sound from how it always was.
 
I did have a bad Magni once (Schiit took care of it fast), but I'm sure the chances of having a bad Asgard 2 are even smaller.
 
It's just too bad that the issue didn't occur immediately. That way I didn't have to waste nearly two days of my time on it..
 
Who knows, maybe it's good and I just hated the A2. Not sure why it was so excessively warm for me. It's not coming from the headphone or source!
Maybe a part inside is failing.
 
 
Oh yeah...at first maybe I thought my ears were just tired or something but i'd switch to my other amps and they'd sound perfect. Even after giving my ears a rest there was really no change.
 
Haha, maybe the Asgard 2 really does need crazy amounts of burn-in to be at it's best. Not going there..

I'm currently using my Asgard 2 as my main headphone amp (for HD650, UE700's and Momentums), the source being a Grant Fidelity Tubedac-11.  I'm using the tube output into the Asgard, and using the preamp outputs to connect to my Emotiva Airmotiv 5's.  The dac is exceptionally quiet, so no noticeable added noise into the asgard.  It works just fine as a preamp, but has a "hardening effect" on the tube-based signal compared to the dac's built in headphone amp (op-amp based) or the tube out directly to the speakers.  The GF dac amp section has a certain midrange richness that is very desirable, yet is lacking power compared to the A2.  Make no mistake, the A2 is a terrific value and a great amp for the price, I just feel it has a slightly "hard" or "clinical" sound to it when compared directly to the dac's output.  I should mention, I'm running the Tubedac with a JJtubes E88CC tube in the buffer stage.
     To my ears, the 650's are a little less warm when heard through the A2.  My Crack is on the way, so that should be a fun comparison.  In low gain mode, my UE700's fare a little better.  Because the UE's have such inherent midrange richness, the A2 doesn't have much of an effect there.  Very Smooth.  The Momentums are very easily powered by both the Tubedac and the A2, and show very audible differences when A-B'ing between them.  With the volume closely matched between them, I played a variety of music including the new album Incitare by Volto! (Fusion band with drummer Danny Carey of Tool) which has serious low bass punch, Moving Pictures by Rush,  The Empire Strikes Back (1993 box set mastering), as well as a number of female vocalists such as Taylor Dayne, Tina Turner, and Andrea Corr (from the Corrs In Blue Album).  With each listen, it was clear that vocals, guitars, string and wind instruments had a bit more realism and life through the Tubedac than from the A2.  That being said, the A2 has far more power and dynamic punch than the Tubedac headphone out, not to mention slightly better low-end response.
     All in all, the A2 is a highly competent performer that is a incredible value.  I find it to be very listenable and versatile, just possessing a slightly clinical edge where I prefer a warmer presentation.

Well apparently my A2 is perfectly A-OK so I got a refund as requested. Totally flabbergasted by this. Was sure there had to be a little something wrong.
I'm kind of on the fence about if I should review it. I'd feel like kind of a jerk, but I see no problem with it. It's just being honest.
 
Right now I'd probably rank it no higher than the original Asgard 1. I pretty much hated that too (very good with the D2000 and HD-600 though) so I don't know why on earth my opinion of the Asgard 2 would change. Stupid me! Now it kind of makes sense why I liked the HD-600 with the Asgard 1 more than the HD-650. The old 650 I had was much darker than the other I have now.
 
Found MY A2 AWFUL with the HD-650 and sort of OK with the Q701. Probably just preferences. Overall it just sounded too fuzzy/blurry/congested. Really lacked clarity and the soundstage was too closed in. You all could say my ears are bad but my other setup sounds amazing even on the same day.  Similar results with the A2 on every setup! A2 from E17 DAC (with L7) was the worst combination i've tried. Felt like warmth overdose when using the E17. First time I ever thought I heard bass bleed on my HD-650 when gaming.
 
Right now as for desktop amps i've tried id rank them as:
 
Micro Amp + Astrodyne PS
Jdslabs O2
Fiio E9 (has some very minor nice coloration)
Schiit Magni (a little bright but not too bad)
Schiit Asgard 1/2
 
 
Funny that people say the A2 doesn't sound warm. Sounds very warm to me . Not coming from my DAC. I guess I prefer the most transparent sound I can get.
 
At least I still love my Schiit Modi  Think now i'm either going to try a Matrix M-Stage or get a Micro DAC before they're gone. The Leckerton UHA-6S looks cool too. Would be nice for my Xbox 360.
 
I suggested that Schiit triple check that amp but it's probably a waste of their time. Really weirded out a bit.

Yeah I don't know what is going on. A little disappointed it didn't turn out the way I had hoped. Like I said before it sounded pretty good (at times) the first day. At one point it didn't sound that dramatically different than my other amp(!?).  I thought maybe my ears were just tired but then i'd switch to my other amp and they'd sound perfect. I even cleaned out my ears just to be safe  I'm only 33 and it's not like my hearing is bad.
 
I shouldn't really compare the A1 and A2 and wasn't really trying to do that. I actually haven't owned the A1 in maybe 4+ years. It was my first desktop amp and I originally used it for the K601 and HD-600 and later tried it with the D2000 and HD-650. Really liked it with the HD-600.
 
The only idea I had is that maybe the power in my house is really crappy and it was degrading the sound. Highly unlikely since the O2 and Micro are fine. I also tried different surge protectors with good filtering etc. Maybe if I had an actual power conditioner it might have sounded better but doubt it. I live in a newer apartment too. I did get the A2 to be dead silent though.
 
Sometime at a meet i'll have to listen to another A2. I bet it might sound good, who knows..

Hey guys! Asgard 2 came in today and everything is working great. I am not very experienced in the review area, but I am recording my initial out of the box impressions. After I have broken it in for around 100 hours I will compare my initial impression to how it sound then. I will give this advice to anyone thinking of purchasing one: DO NOT judge it COLD out of the box. It took mine an hour to fully warm up and it completely changed the sound. It went from a very weak, thin, and fair I say hollow sound. to a VERY clear, separated, and detailed sound. If I didn't know better I would have thought the music was all in my head. Also once warm it is like it's not even there. You just get clean power. It hardly contributes to the sound signature. And nearly needless to say using my HE-400 it makes the E11 sound stuffy. One downside (sort of) where the e11 would mask track quality the Asgard 2 only knows how to do one thing- Amplify. So quality in quality out. Anyway that's just an initial impression Out of the box. So to recap
1- Let it warm up
2- It is nothing between your source and your headphones.
3- You will hear the quality of your tracks
Thanks guys, ill post a more extensive review after it is broken in!

Yeah I had it on for 7-8 hours the first day. I'm still interested in ideas as to what went wrong but obviously i've moved on now but haven't totally given up on Schiit products. If I buy another one of their products i'm SCHIIT out of luck for another year. One product return per year. Maybe it was just tons of external interference crapping up the sound. Hardly seems possible. I live in a 3 story apartment and maybe a lot of Wi-Fi could cause issues, but probably impossible. I think the cell phone/wi-fi interference only applies to rare op-amps. I think at one point I even moved the unit about 5 feet away from any other electronics. Even had it in another room for awhile.
 
I think maybe i'm too picky and just don't like the sound. I actually like the Magni and Modi though. Maybe one of these days I can try to find a used Bifrost.
 
BTW my A2 had zero transformer hum. Dead silent for me.

Yeah, I hope it won't disillusion you. I was very happy with my Schiit while I was learning about this hobby. Between the aesthetics, customer service , and value... How can anyone complain about anything coming out of Schiit. That being said, not all gear is meant for everyone (thus the hundreds of thousands of gear combinations out there!).
I haven't listened to the Magni nor the Modi, so I cannot comment, but I know a couple of locals are really happy with theirs. So if are happy, do yourself a favor and try not get upgrade-itis like myself. I am holding out until the new revision of AQ's DargonFly is released and I will be splitting my gear into portable and move up from Schiit to SPL. I certainly recommend Schiit gear to those just starting out. (Or those looking for end game with the next tier up!)
I hope your issue is isolated to just your A2 and doesn't ever surface on the rest of your gear. Best of luck and cheers, it's been fun following and trying to problem solve (on our end  ). .Head-Fi-Threads-First-Post-500x50 { width: 500px; height: 50px; }

Hey guys,
I just put in my order for one. I almost bought a Modi, too, but I talked myself out of it. Well, I've almost talked myself out of it. I currently have a FiiO E10 that I am using as my current DAC, but I was wondering how the Modi would compare to the E-10? My reasoning for not getting it was that I couldn't imagine it being a whole lot bigger of an upgrade. I figured I should save my money (for now ) and wait until I can afford something like the Bifrost. That would probably be a long ways down the line, though, as I don't have anything that would really take advantage of the multiple inputs since I primarily use USB. What do you guys think? If I go ahead and buy the Modi, I doubt I will be upgrading the DAC for a very long time.
 
Also, anyone have any recommendations for a set of mid-range ($200-$300) headphones to pair with this thing? I have the Denon AH-D2000s right now. I don't know that I'm looking for an upgrade as much as something different. I just want to try different things, and there isn't a Hi-Fi store anywhere that close to me. That, or maybe I should just wait until around Christmas and maybe stretch my budget for the HD 600s or something.

Forgot a few words.

That uber Bifrost must be one impressive DAC because the Modi has always been crystal clear to me.
 
IMO the Modi is no thinner than an ODAC (which doesn't sound thin/cold/bright etc). For ME it depends on the recordings. It sounds very natural to me and uncolored. However I do feel that my Micro DAC add a tiny bit more body to the sound of some things but it's so minor. I like the warmth of my E17 but I wish it was as good overall as the Modi. Somehow it makes me feel as if it's soundstage is so closed in compared to the Modi.
 
LOL the only time I heard a extremely small amount of warmth on my Modi was when I used the T90. I was like WOW..it took a T90 to hear that?! Modi sounds transparent to my ears.
 
It's not super revealing and extremely detailed but sounds great to me. I would say it's one of my best purchases.
 
Chances are that if I liked the Modi I would like the Bifrost. Bifrost is on my radar, but not within the next 6 months since I just bought a 2nd  DAC.

Well, I only listen to it for 3-4 hrs and still evaluating the uber bifrost, take it as that. I haven't fully grasp it yet and still trying to understand it as I had the modi and listened to it for 4 months. The bass part is what I didn't expect, I was thinking its just a dac.
I bought it after i keep hearing people raving about it and was skeptical of its performance especially when people say they can tell the difference between the standard bifrost vs the uber bifrost. My original plan was to try it out and if I don't like it (which I really didn't think I would over the modi except maybe a little) than I would return/sale and save money for an anedio d2. If that didn't go well, I would stick to the modi. Well right now I'm listening to them after a couple of days of a break from them, I decided this is some good stuff.Edited by soundeffect - 10/22/13 at 8:03pm

After a while now with the Asgard2 I can say it's a nice change from the Magni.  It's slightly warmer, but going from Modi to Bifrost made more of a difference to the bass punch than Magni to Asgard2 did.  Treble seemed to be a little more resolving while not being harsh, and instrument separation is a little better during busy passages and when multiple instruments harmonize together.
 
I was expecting more of a drastic change going off of MattTCG's comments, but I'll just ride that off as half head-fi hyperbole and half HE-400's lack of ultimate scalability.
 
It also hasn't gone bad sounding randomly for me so I won't be returning it to Schiit to see if it's a lemon or not.
 
The most redeeming quality the Asgard2 has over the Magni is its volume pot play and switchable gain.  With the Magni you're basically limited to less efficient full-sized headphones.  More sensitive headphones would have very little volume pot play and the very start of Magni's pot has channel imbalance.  With the Asgard2 you can use the hardest to drive headphones down to the most sensitive IEMs with plenty of play.  Everybody already knew this though.  For now I use low gain on the HE-400 and the knob averages around 12 o'clock.

Have you ever tried the Asgard 1? Believe it or not I had that for over a year as my only amp. Loved it with the D2000 and HD-600, but not as much with the HD-650.
 
My issues with the Asgard 2 is a mystery I will never ever figure out. My only idea is maybe I have tons of interference due to living in an apartment.
I bet there's tons of cell phones and wireless/Wi-FI devices nearby. I should have taken it to my mom's house to test it. Pretty sure it's not noisy power because all my other stuff is fine.
Maybe everything else filters it out better. Maybe someday I can buy a power conditioner for cheap. Probably a waste of money.
 
I'm going to try the Vali though. I actually read up on it a little and sounds like something I might like. No returns on it (for me) and I'm ok with that.
I've had my eyes on a hybrid tube amp for awhile but was waiting for a US built one.
 
BTW I bet an Asgard 2 would be great for a Grado or a DT-880/T90.

tdockweiler,
 
I've spent several minutes trying to find your post with the symptoms of which you complain of your Asgard 2.   I have not found that post, and have to get back to what I was doing before I read this sent to my email.  So my response is about the problem I had with my Asgard 2, and may not be what you are referring to.
 
I had a problem of what I call a haziness in the sound,  almost as if there was a fine distortion.  Managed to track it down to interference getting into the input of the amp.
So I had Blue Jean cable make me up a 1 ft. stereo cable to go between my JDS dac and the Asgard 2 for about 30 bucks.  It completely resolved the problem, and the sound is now clean and clear and made the background black silent compared to what I had before.  If thats the kind of problem your having, then thats my suggestion.
 
Cordially

That sounds very similar to the issue I had. At random it felt as if the weight of the sound would be sucked out. You can loop tracks and hear this. It felt like my ears were playing tricks on me.
On the Buena Vista Social Club CD it's like very subtle background details would magically go missing. Most bizarre thing I ever heard. Sound fading in?! What the heck..
The main issue was the sound felt very cloudy/hazy and not clear at all. Possibly because of all the interference.
 
I got the best results with the following:
Mogami W2893 interconnect cable which has very good shielding
USB cable with ferrite bead and using a powered USB hub (I tried two and with and without the hub). Even bought a USB card!
Amp removed away from PC and connected to a surge protector with filtering.
 
I thought the problem was fixed until it came back after an hour. I even tried using different wall outlets.
 
Strangely I could not hear any noise at all with this setup when no songs were being played and the volume was all the way up.
You could hear subtle changes when switching cables or surge protectors. I have a Furman SS-6B and ISobar 4 surge protector. The TrippLite ISObar is $40 and seemed to be the best.
My Micro Amp has an upgraded power supply with filtering and in 3 years I can't hear any noise at all ever. Maybe with an IEM.
 
BTW another funny symptom is that at one point I thought my amp suddenly blew up because the bass would randomly get bloated.
 
On day 3 I think it sounds pretty close in sound to my old Asgard but even warmer/bassier than I remember it being. It kind of reminded me of an E10 in sound signature.
 
I should have just moved it into a room with nothing else plugged in and no routers/cell phones with 1000 feet 
 
Oh and at one point i was sure it was interference of some sort from my ethernet port and then later it was a bad USB port! Turns out it was neither because my other amps worked fine on the same setup.
 
I'm guessing that my Asgard 2 is just not compatible with my apartment!
 
Never had an amp be this susceptible to interference if that was what it was.
 
Someday I'd like to find out what was going on, but I guess it will be one of those unsolved mysteries.

I had a bit of love / hate with the Magni amp.  It had a nice amount of power for the lil' beast.  When it comes to needing a somewhat portable amp that doesn't stand out as much, that is the real deal.  Given the price, I think there's probably little to complain about, but I did notice a few small items.  The "bleed" from the front panel LED through the cut-out for the volume knob was a bit discerning.  I figure I could have easily resolved it by applying some felt inside the case between the volume pot and the knob to control this a bit.  I didn't really have it long enough to do any real extensive testing other than put it through some minimal testing with my HD-600s and the HE-400s.  But, when one can get an Asgard I in the used market for about $150, and usually includes shipping, it might be best to opt for that route.
 
After winning an auction several days back for an Asgard 2, it finally arrived today after a 9-day journey across the U.S.  I realize there was a lot of bad weather across the U.S., but the shipping information indicated 12/4/2013 as the approximate delivery date.  But, she finally made it - to a bit of disappointment on my end.  The seller indicated there wasn't any real noticeable hum from what they could hear.   But, when I was 3+ feet across from where the amp was sitting, she was humming right along.  The 2nd area of concern was the way the item was packed, and shipped using a large USPS Priority Mail box that looked like it made 3+ journeys across the U.S.  It had a been a recycled box, but the Asgard should have had something a bit better.  However, due to the hum issue, it's going back.  I'll have to bit about $20 in shipping / insurance costs to get it back to the seller, but that could still be better than living with a lemon that could be more problematic down the road.
 
I created a little collection of pictures in my gallery on "how not to ship a $200 amp": http://www.head-fi.org/g/a/831253/how-not-to-ship-a-200-amplifier/

Wayne,
 
sorry to hear of your trouble. I've had boxes come in usps that looked just that bad and a few worse. Some contained damaged items and some not. It all comes down to how the item is packaged inside. With a large flat rate box you could have easily double boxed the A2  or at least just used a bunch of bubble wrap and it would have likely been fine. The Styrofoam pillars that Schiit uses are by far the best...there is a reason they use them.
 
Regarding the hum...there was an issue with the early release A2 units that exhibited the hum, I had one of them and returned it. I have had no reports of the hum going away. 
 
I have had two used Schiit amps used that had issues. Despite not being the original owner, when I emailed Schiit about the problem they offered to fix it if I paid shipping.

I just want to say thanks to all who posted your insight and impressions on this thread.  Sorry about those who experienced trouble with the A2.  I've never seen a site where the manufacturer monitors the posts and responds to answer questions.  Well done, Jason.
I purchased the A2/uberB as my first desktop combination about a month ago, before I found and read this thread. 
I have experienced zero hum from my A2.  Also, it doesn't get very hot but I'm driving low-impedance devices with it.
The A2/B combo provides a big improvement to the sound quality with all my devices.  The old setup was simply a computer/dragonfly.  I have no experience with other desktop equipment.
In particular, I noticed great improvement to the bass when driving the Shure SE535.  The brilliant treble/mids are enhanced but the bass is much better so those IEM's are now a real pleasure to experience.
Other equipment I'm driving with the A2/B are the Ed-8 and LCD-X.  I was thinking about selling/trading the Ed-8 until I heard them driven by the A2/B.  Now they sound quite good and balanced even less scratchy in the mids.  The LCD-X are just a great set of cans and sound extraordinary with the A2/B.  On the LCD-X appreciation thread, people are raving about them driven by the balanced Schiit equipment; that may be on my horizon as well.
Overall, well satisfied with the A2/B equipment especially at it's price point.
I particularly wanted to thank those who posted comments about the A2 driving higher impedance cans like the HE500 and HD800.  Good to know the A2/B combo will likely drive the HD800 which are on my wish list.
Happy New Year!
 
All the best -

I had a quick question about the Asgard 2's pre-amp outs. Im wondering exactly how those would work and how I can use them in the new setup Im putting together. Can I say have a Bitfrost as the DAC and feed the output from that to the input of the Asgard 2 and then the output from the Asgard 2 to my Bottlehead Crack and have the Asgard 2 act as just a pass through to the Crack when I wanted to listen to that? It would be nice if this setup worked this way because then I wouldnt have to be swapping cables when I wanted the Bitfrost to feed the Crack. Will the Asgard 2 work that way? Would it have to be powered on to act as a pass through? Or is it not a pass through and an actual pre-amplification from a lower level source like say an iPod or something? If thats the case then the Asgard 2 would have to be powered on in order to feed the Crack correct?

Quesion: I have an Oppo BDP105 and I just bought the Asgard2. What is the optimal way of connecting the Asgard to the Oppo?
 
Currently I have been running some XLR to RCA cables from the back of the Oppo into the Asgard. Sound for the most part is really nice, however, I was shocked at how high I had to turn up the Asgard to get my HD650 loud. On high gain I have the volume turned to about 3 o'clock, and on many streamed songs, I need the Oppo's volume set at 92-100. For physical media like CDs and SACDs, I can set the Oppo's volume at more forgiving 82-90.
 
I found that the sound of the Asgard is pretty much what everyone says it is, except I found that when the music gets really busy (as in many layers of instruments/voices/effects all hitting at once) the Asgard had a hard time seperating the different aspects of the music, but with a standard straight up jazz or rock band (3-5 layers of music at most) the seperation is spectacular. Also, sometimes some parts of song that have been tradionally presented very up front sound like they have been pushed far back.
 
So I am wondering if the whole Oppo XLR out -> RCA in Asgard2 was the best way to go. In addition to the issue above, the other things that make me think perhaps I am not connecting this right are:
 
1) The volume. I cant be that deaf! In reality, when I hook up the Asgard to either the HRT Microstreamer or FiiO X3 (in DAC mode) through line out the volume seems more plentiful
2) Although the overall quality of the Oppo's sound is still better than either the microstreamer or x3, neither of those two give me the 'busy music' seperation problem and seems to image everything fine.
 
Any help or tips would be great!

=============================================

Ok guys I'm pretty new to all this, I've posted this in the Schiit owners club but maybe this would be better posted in this thread. They recommended a new DAC but I don't believe that will remedy my issues, as I believe it is a case of this amps sound signature not pairing with my beyers.
 
I received my Asgard 2 Friday night and I've basically been unhappy with the sound since I received it. It does sound great, don't get me wrong and I think Schiit has an awesome product. I just don't think it is a good match for my ears, my headphones or the music I listen to. I would just like some more validation on my thoughts before I send this back.
 
My setup SoundblasterZ/AS2/DT990 Pro I also have a Fiio E10 that may sound a little better with this amp(I know shameful DACs)
 
First off this AMP picks up so much interference from my PC, at high listening levels the buzzing/scratching is pretty intense. I was able to isolate this by running my Fiio E10 off my tablet. PC to USB connection also yielded interference. I've tried Hi/Lo and every set of volume combinations in between.
 
Overall I feel the sound is a bit congested/fuzzy/dry and lacks separation when there are multiple layers, bass lines just seem to mesh together and sound nasty. I listen to a lot of rock and EDM so I really like to crank my headphones, by the time I reach an exciting listening level the sound becomes really harsh. Bass impact also sounds sloppy and thin. I feel the AS2 brings out the worst in my Beyers and masks its real qualities. I really don't know why anyone would recommend this amp with these headphone? It is really fatiguing on my ears...
 
The only dedicated AMP I can compare this to is the Musical Fidelity V-Can II, I gave this to my dad for Christmas and I've missed it everyday that its been gone. This amp was crystal clear at all volumes, bass impact was tight fast and clean, separation was amazing, sound stage was HUGE. This amp was also connected to the same exact system my Schiit is connected to.
 
I would really appreciate anyone's thoughts on this, maybe even another AMP recommendation. The AS2 did seem to get better after I burned it in, but it is still not anywhere near the sound I expected, and its been cooking for a while now.. Could a proper DAC really warm this AMP up and clean up the sound that much??

Ooops, let me slow down and answer your questions.  No, I don't think the HE-500 needs that much power which is why I mentioned the fact that people are using resistors in-line which reduces the power to the headphones and allows more effective use of the volume knob.  I think that answers your first two questions.  Of course no one wants to destroy their headphones or their hearing.  If you want learn more about how people are using the Mini-X for headphones (or not) and what they think of the sound, you could start with the thread that I referenced earlier:  http://www.head-fi.org/t/629352/he-500-lcd2-d5000-dt770-sr80-on-a-speaker-amp-emotiva-mini-x-a-100-project/3255#post_10278665
 
As far as what makes it sound better, I can't tell you.  I can only go by what I've heard from other hi-fiers since I haven't tried it myself.  As ben_r mentioned, it's a good value proposition and, according to some head-fiers the SQ is better than other more expensive amplifiers such as Lyr, etc..  But, of course, it's up to everyone to judge for themselves and not everyone would necessarily agree obviously.  Although I have a Mini-X, I have yet to do the 1/4 TRS mod. and get a pair of HE-500's to plug into it.  But, once I do I will let you know.

You do realize that people who like the tube sound will not agree with you about the Lyr. Personally I prefer SS because I want accurate and clean, but that's my preference. As far as sounding better than other SS amps, I will not buy into that. Amps are a simple science, no not science it's engineering which is an applied science. there are no mysteries other than the human element, I think we are very good at fooling ourselves. I've learned long ago how to listen, I've designed preamps and line amps for professional equipment, electronic music synthesizers, all sorts of stuff, I know the engineering as well as the human aspect. I'll be the first to say that you can buy an amp that costs 3 times the price of the Emo and few people will be able to tell them apart. The differences in opinions after some blind listening would be very amusing and varied between individuals or the same persons trying again.

Alright, so some initial impressions from the last couple hours of listening and some comparisons with Lyr.
 
HD 600: I think I may like the Asgard 2 over the Lyr when paired with the HD 600. Not entirely sure yet, but that's the way it's going so far. Some people are saying it's warmer with the Asgard 2 pairing, but I don't really hear that here. What I do here is more detail and accuracy over the Lyr as well as tightness in the lows.
 
HD 700: No doubt about it. The Lyr pairs better with the HD 700 over the Asgard 2. The Lyr smooths out the frequency of the HD 700 vs the Asgard 2 which over accentuates the details to a point where they sound somewhat distorted. It's not bad at all, but it's obvious the Lyr has been synergy with the HD 700.
 
K702 AE: I've got the same impressions as the HD 700 here. The warmer Lyr is just a better pairing with the K702 AE vs the Asgard 2 for all of the same reasons.
 
Overall, I'm happy. It'd be ridiculous to think any single amp will work well with everything. Anything that makes the HD 600 sound better is alright in my book. I'll also be able to use preamps now to power my external monitors without having to burn tubes. More impressions to come as time goes by.

Not sure if you've gotten any responses, but I'll throw in my 2 cents. I don't own an HD800 (300 ohm impedance according to Senn's website, but coulda sworn they were 600), but I do own the HD700 (150ohm) and HD650 (300ohm). The A2 is definitely a great amp to pair with the HD700, as it allows for great volume (ie. loud) at about 12-2o'clock. The HD650s also pair very well with the A2, and usually their sweet spot is a little higher than the 700s: great volume can be had at about 1-3o'clock.
 
I do believe that, even with equal impedence, the HD800s are harder to drive than the HD650 (that's based on other people's comments, but I do believe it: I also own Momentums and Amperiors, each are 18ohms, but the Amperiors get louder on less volume from any of my amps/DAPs). That being the case, I would think, if you want to listen to the HD800s really loud, you would probably be pushing the A2 to its limit (of course if your source has a particularly high line out volume, this might not be true, I find the analog outs on my Oppo 105 to have much less volume than my the analog out on my UberBifrost).

Low gain only when I use the Amperiors or Momentums. I dunno about 9 o' clock, I think for me that be much much too low volume. I like to listen to music loud, regardless of genre! Maybe I am just deaf! Some of my friends think I listen to headphones too loud, other friends ask me to crank it up a lil higher than I normal put it for myself.
 
When I use a db meter app on my phone, I think I usually hit about 88-80dbs when I place the phone's mic in between my headphones cups. That's usually the upper end of the level I listen to. Hey, if you have an Android phone, would you mind downloading 'Sound Meter' and placing your phone in between the HD600's cups and crank it to 9o' clock then 12o clock and tell me what db's you read? Just curious to see the difference.

I am not deaf! I actually have great hearing!
 
Well no, I don't...sorta. I do have a hard time understanding what people are saying to me when there is alot of ambient noise. For example, if the TV is on, or I am in my office (I share an office with like 8 other TAs) and there's a lot of background noise, I can't understand jack sh*t of what someone is telling me, even though I can hear them speak. When its relatively quite, I can usually pick up on sounds/whispering when others can't. I dunno if this has to do with my hearing or if its a matter of attention (I am a bit ADHD): maybe if there is too much auditory stimulation around me, my mind can't focus in on what people say, even when I try, but when it's quiet, my brain can hyper-concentrate on the noise around me.
 
In any case, I just love to immerse myself in music, and low volume music tends to not hold my attention as much as loud music does. So my idea of a 'enough power to properly drive XYZ' may not necessarily be the same as yours.However, I am also not alone in my thoughts about the A2 and HD800, and in the Schiit line of amps, the A2 is not the meant to be a power monster, the Lyr is. Just my 2 cents based on my listening  preferences.

I thought so.  fenderf4i, thanks for the tip for shipping.  I thought it was FedEx Ground that was the equivalent to UPS Canada Standard in terms of being super gouged for brokerage fees.  I guess the FedEx Int'l isn't much better.  I ordered a joystick from the US during black friday for $60 USD + free shipping and it unknowingly shipped via UPS Std... UPS wanted $42 at the door... of which, only $7.20 was the actual PST+GST, the other ~$35 was their brokerage/disburstment/processing/collection fees.  
 
Anyway, I think I'll try to return the A2 next week and use the money to order one directly from Schiit.  I might as well add a Vali to the order too while I'm at it since it doesn't add anything to the $43.75 shipping.  It's kinda funny that the shipping is the same price for 1x Vali, or 1x Asgard2, or Vali+Asgard2.  I wanted to try out the Vali but balked at the ~$44 shipping for a $120 amp, but $44 for $370 worth of amps is more palatable.  Thanks for the help guys!

Just thought I would post real quick that I received my Asgard 2 on Saturday. I am highly impressed. I think I ordered it on Tuesday and it shipped on Wednesday. I live in MO and with it coming from CA, I expected it to take almost a week. They shipped it out to be delivered FedEx Home delivery on Saturday. For $12?! While a lot of companies seem to ripping people off with shipping these days, they are going above and beyond. Thank you!
 
Customer service aside, I love the amp. My main choice of HP are my K701's and it has no problem driving those even on low gain. I ran the volume up to about 3:00 and it was more than I could handle for much more than a minute or so. I don't feel like damaging my hearing. I tend to listen at a comfortable 80dB give or take depending on what I'm listening to and how long. If I am evaluating or only going to listen for a short while, I may run it up a few dB. As far as sound quality, it sounds great. I didn't necessarily expect a world of difference from my current setup. To be honest, I A/B'd it with my X3 and I couldn't tell the difference. I know that may seem like an insult. But, it isn't. I love my X3 and I think it has a pretty good built-in amp for driving relatively efficient headphones. It has plenty of power to drive my K701's, definitely enough for my Grados. If I were driving harder to drive or lower efficiency phones, I may notice more of a difference. I even went as far as running a response measurement on the amp and it is pretty darn flat. In my opinion, an amp should only add gain, not change the sound quality. And, the Asgard 2 seems to do just that.
 
So, anyway. I didn't intend on this being an in-depth review as I am not very articulate or elegant when it comes to that. Just wanted to give my initial impressions and share my excitement. I am now officially a Schiit-head.

Just a little update on my issue.  It turns out I was wrong, it was not a mechanical relay click that I was hearing, it was a crack/snap noise from thermal expansion of the metal chassis.  That explains why it only happened after at least 30-45mins of powered on time when the chassis got really hot.  While testing and timing it over several days last week to narrow down the exact symptoms so that I could report it I happened to press down lightly on the front left of the chassis near the screw to feel for the temperature I heard a crack noise which sounded like a loud relay click.  Then I started pressing down near the other screws and another slightly quieter crack noise popped from the front right screw.  After that there was no more noise.  
 
I was able to reproduce this consistently for several days after letting the unit fully cool down and then heating it up again.  I then checked the sides and noticed a gap between the silver chassis and gray middle side/back panel piece near the front on both sides.  The gap was bigger near the front of the unit versus the back.  So I checked the screws and they appeared snug and not loose.  I tried unscrewing them a few turns, then flicked it on and tried the heat test again and it still made the crack noise.  After letting it fully cool down again, I pressed down on the front of the chassis to shrink the side gaps and then tightened down on the top front 2 screws and repeated the heat test and now there is no more crack/snap noise.  After 3 days of separate 3+ hour runs there's no more crack/snap noise.  
 
Yay!  Now I don't have to deal with the hassle of a return/refund/exchange.  Now back to enjoying the music... and saving up for some Alpha Dogs.

No i haven't done a direct comparison to the Bifrost Uber (I got mine super cheaper earlier this year for $250) but I can tell you the headphone amplifier isn't that powerful.  It's more of an entry level dac/amp to me.  Actually it looks like the XDA2 has been marked down to $269, which is still a sick deal vs the $400 it used to cost.  As a headphone amplifier i think the XDA2 is lacking, Emotiva also sells the Stealth DC-1 which has two of the same DAC chips as the XDA2 and dual headphone outputs.  I can't tell if it's more powerful than the xda2 though.  Judging from the gear you have listed in your signature, I would skip the XDA-2 as a DAC or amp.  I have done a comparison of the xda2 as an amp against my Asgard 2, the A2 blows the XDA2 out of the water, IMO.  I love my Bifrost+A2 stack.  I would suggest you look at the Peachtree DAC-itx, http://www.amazon.com/Peachtree-Audio-DAC-iTX-Converter-Asynchronous/dp/B00E4WSPBG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394563381&sr=8-1&keywords=dac+itx.  That's the only other DAC i considered based off all the research I did before getting my Bifrost Uber.  If you look at the reviews you will see that the Bifrost is warmer and the Peachtree is more analytical.  Pm me if you have any other questions though as i don't want to derail the thread any further :D

Thanks SO much for the feedback, I guess I now know what I'll be buying myself for my birthday in a week. <grin>
 
Has anyone seen specs anywhere for the voltage output at the preamp outs for both the high and low gain settings? I'm assuming that it would make for a preamp with a quieter background at its low gain setting...or maybe they're both noise free.
 
I have no problem getting full output from either Parasound amp when using my Creek OBH-22 passive (all my DAC's output right at 2V) so I'll be fine with ANY gain at all.  
 
I used the Lyr for a while as a preamp/HP amp, and it sounded great, very dynamic and vocals were stellar through a Parasound A21 and Magnepan 1.7's. I wish the Lyr had High/Low gain switch on the back BUT ya can't have everything. The guys at Schiit Audio are doing an incredible job producing wonderful gear at very reasonable prices.  
 
Thanks again!

Well, I finally plugged the trigger on the Asgard 2, it should arrive tomorrow.
 
I already own the Lyr, but I've been using easier to drive headphones (mainly the P7's) a lot lately and thought it would be worth a shot to not only give the Asgard 2 a listen as an HP amp, but also try it out as a single source preamp in my office system feeding a Parasound Halo A23 amp. My speakers are usually either the B&W Nautilus 805's or the CDM 1NT's with a Velodyne DD-10 sub. 
 
For the past month or so I've been using a Creek OBH-22 passive and I have had no problems at all with gain as the A23's Input Sensitivity is 1 V for 28.28 V just like my A21. My DAC (this week anyway) puts out 2.1 V RMS so I'm wondering if I'd be better off "when using it as a preamp" to use the Low Gain setting? 
 
I see that the product info on their website says that the A2 is a "no overall feedback design in High Gain mode" does this mean that they use feedback in Low Gain mode and if so will that matter at all to the sound quality when used as a preamp?
 
Thanks!
 
P.S
I'm keeping the Lyr regardless of how well the A2 preforms.

Here's my subjective impression based on the last Head-fi meet I attended:
 
I heard an AKG K712 on a Schiit Lyr and Asgard 2 both being paired with the Schiit Bifrost Uber.
 
Schiit Lyr has the "tube" sound and has warm midrange, smoothed highs, good bass, detail is apparent but there is a slight fuzz. For the short time I listened to it I was impressed by the tube sound and was interested how my DT880 would pair up with it but forgot to bring it to the meet : [ 
 
Schiit Asgard 2 is a neutral leaning towards warm sounding headphone amp with amazing detail in the highs, accurate midrange, deep impactful bass( more so than the Lyr IMO ) but is likely based on the headphones you have. The sense of a 3D soundstage is there with great instrument separation on both amps. Asgard 2 has a cleaner sound but it is not sterile like the Objective 2 and has deeper bass and warmer mids.
 
EDIT: Right now I have my own Asgard 2 with me and I am just so happening to be listening to the Cure. Robert Smith's voice is incredibly life like and I can hear his breaths that are going with the melody of "Close to Me" floating around back and forth between right earcup and left earcup with the realistic imaging. A very nice nice experience.
 
Also listened to Nujabes - Hydeout Productions in FLAC and Metaphorical Music and let's just say the frequency balance is perfect for me with the Asgard 2 lending just the right amount of bass coloration to my DT880s
 
HOWEVER, if you are driving low impedance cans that require a lot of power the Lyr is a no brainer
 
Now, onto the Bottlehead Crack. I heard the Bottlehead Crack with the DT880 600 ohm and HD650. First the HD650 and Bottlehead Crack is a fantastic pairing with lush mids, deep bass, and euphonic sound lacking in detail (the "veil"). DT880 600 ohm on the BH Crack had nice bass, weird mids, and just didn't sound correctly paired with synergy. Be reminded this pairing was paired together with the Schiit Bifrost Uber so I can accurately pinpoint differences between the Asgard 2.
 
I personally own the DT880 250 ohm and find the pairing WAY better than the Bottlehead Crack with DT880 600 ohm. However if you have an HD650 buy the Bottlehead Crack

I'm running mine from a Bifrost Uber, with either a macbook Air via USB or an iPhone 5S via a Pure i-20 with a 30 pin to lightning adapter, coax out and coax into the Bifrost.  I have an unnamed for now  highish end all in one with a class A amp section and an ESS 9018 dac.  The all in one is much more aggressive at showing details, giving it the impression of being much brighter.  I find the Asgard 2 / Bifrost to be a bit more relaxed, in a positive way.  I ran into this same thing with a Northern Fidelity NF DAC (reviewed by project86 for those interested.  Nice dac, not many around) and a Burson Soloist SL.  I finally narrowed the differences down to the two dac implementations.  My initial thoughts are that the same issue exists with the all in one and the Asgard 2 / Bifrost Uber.  My guess is the amp sections are gonna be really close in sound, and the Dacs are gonna be where the difference comes from.  Once my RCA "Y" splitters come in, I'll be able to run same dac to both A2 and all in one amp sections and do a bit more comparing.
 
What's my point?  Maybe the brightness is a case of the A2 revealing the source's characteristics?
 

After a couple hours last night - I am quite impressed.  The Asgard 2 is better than I thought.  A nice black background and no noticeable noise on high or low gain.  OK, shut off the music, and max the volume, and a little hum leaks through.  Nothing down in the listening range of the volume pot, and nothing when music plays.  The A-2 seems to be a good, clean amp.  I like the pairing, and tend to use high gain with the PM-1, though low gain works fine.  With my Alpha Dogs, high gain is required.  Low gain will drive them, but you can get to full travel on the volume pot without getting to ear bleed levels.
 
I think the Bifrost Uber has a fair amount to do with my experience with the Asgard 2.  The Bifrost Uber is a really nice sounding source.  The Asgard 2 seems to get out of the way pretty well.  I've read comments that it is not as musical as some amps.  I only have the unnamed all in one to compare to, but the all in one is a couple of tiers up in product placement.  The Asgard 2 compares very well.  I'd like to find a comparison to the Burson Soloist or Soloist SL, as I find the Bursons to be very musical to my ears.
 
I was all set to get a Lyr, but didn't think it would pair all that well with the PM-1's so I went for the Asgard 2.  It is a nice pairing with both the PM-1 and the Alpha Dogs.  I really want to do some comparisons to summit-fi gear at the July SF Bay meet, and see whee it really stands.  For the price I paid used for the Bifrost uber and the Asgard 2, it seems so far one heck of a value.
 
Caveat - all impressions after only couple hours, so the new toy / fanboy syndrome hasn't worn off yet.  Still, I am pleasantly surprised.

I just bought an Asgard 2 about a month ago. I have a pair of Beyerdynamic 990. Pros that I use for listening after the kids have gone to bed. I've been using an older Yamaha integrated strictly for its headphone section to drive them, and it recently crapped out. Not wanting to go overboard on a headphone amp, I checked into the Schiit line. After lots of research here, I resisted the urge to start higher in the product line and went with the seemingly do-it-all Asgard 2.
Glad I did! The build quality is suburb, easily matching my Rogue tube gear in quality and appearance. More importantly, it sounds wonderful with my cans. Smooth, powerful, solid state that sounds like good tube gear. There is absolutely zero external hum on my unit, and also nothing through the headphones except music. This little amp matched up with a good set of headphones may be one of the best deals in audio.
My source is my VPI TT with Benz Micro Ace SL, driven through a PS Audio GCPH Phono amp, and a Rogue Perseus Magnum preamp. My other source is a Rega a Planet 2000 with a Rega DAC, again through the Perseus. Everything sounds good together!
Don't let the price fool you -this thing is serious. Highly recommended!

The Asgard 2 is a VERY well thought out and designed (Fully discrete), Class A amp (and preamp)...let it burn in a while before you make up your mind on its value. I don't listen to my gear when I'm running it in as I don't want to get used to what I'm hearing and I played music through mine for a couple days before I truly sat down and gave it my full attention. It certainly sounds clean and dynamic as a preamp driving a Parasound A21 amp in my office system and it has a dead silent background with my Westone W40's (on Low Gain) and sounds sweet on High Gain driving my HE-500's.
 
Opinions will vary with any piece of audio gear (that's just the way it is) but let it settle in a while before deciding if its living up to your expectations or not. 
Best of luck!

I was considering the Valhalla but it's a necessity that it works with all headphones I have (lower and higher impedance ones) and any I might get in the future. It seems like the Valhalla would be amazing with my DT 990s, but not so great with my others. The Valhalla also lacks the pre-outs, which I could be using in the future. I also didn't really want to spend more than $249. I liked that the Asgard is so versatile. The TEAC is nice, I tried several different DACs before settling on it. I was shocked that it offers balanced outputs for that price, it made it a future proof purchase for me. I guess it's even better than I thought. I'll be sure to update you all over the weekend.
 
I tried several other amps in a local hi-fi store over the weekend. The wooden Grado one was decent but it was twice the price and doesn't offer the solid construction that Schiit does nor the pre-outs. There was a chinese brand I tried that sounded terrible. I definitely like the Asgard the best out of the ones I've heard, I just need to decide if it's worth the upgrade over the integrated TEAC one that I already have.

I didn't like the fact that tubes are so fragile and need to be replaced. It just seems like an added pain. I'm sure I'll get a tube amp when I'm older but for now it's just a hassle and another expense. I've reached the point where the returns are diminishing insanely fast, which sorta sucks. I remember when I first got my DT 990s and used them with the receiver for my speakers and I was astounded. 
 
Back on topic though, I'm going to try the Asgard 2 with my Bowers & Wilkins C5s tomorrow. I'm curious to see how it handles them. It also didn't get as hot as I was expecting. I only used it for like 30 minutes, and it got warm but not like hot enough to cook on like people said. I'm impressed with how it opened up the soundstage. It sounded much more like my KEF speakers than before. I didn't notice much difference with the other two headphones, but those are cheaper than the amp itself so I guess that's to be expected. 
 
How long will this amp last me if I eventually get better headphones? Like how does it pair with the HD 650s, the HD 800s, the Beyerdynamic T90s and T1 and stuff like that? I've heard the Valhalla is good with the Beyerdynamics and HD 800s but I haven't read much about how the Asgard works with them.

I've found (for me) that any reasonably well-done solid state amps are usually sidegrades; they may sound a bit different from each other, but aren't typically night and day type differences (unless one just doesn't have enough power for your cans or is just a bad amp or something).
 
I wrote a number of sentences sharing my experiences then realized a list would be better...so behold, a list!
 
Cans I've Owned:
HD600 - Really good with A2
LCD-2 - Really good as well; to my taste sounded better than most tubes I've tried in a Lyr.
 
Cans I've Heard (meets and such, with the A2):
K-1000 - Sounded okay, but not really enough power
HD800 - Sounded good, but I didn't have a lot of time with them. I'm pretty sensitive to harsh treble though, and I didn't immediately hear any from this combo.
HE-500 - Sounded good. Not a long listen, but I had the LCD-2s at the time and could appreciate why people have a tough time choosing between the two.
HE-6 - Worked better than I was expecting, considering the horror stories, but could've probably used some more power :)
D2000, D5000 - Sound signature is not to my preference, but it sounded like they got along with the A2 just fine.
LCD-3 - Only listened to them briefly (didn't want to tempt myself too much) but they sounded quite good on the A2, and only needed the volume at about 9 for a good listening level.
K701 - To my preference these need tubes, as I find them too harsh otherwise. Still, A2 seemed to be just fine on power for these.
Mad Dogs - Powered fine, but overly warm for my taste. I liked these better out of an O2, but not for lack of power or anything from the A2.
 
 
 
TL;DR - So, as a general answer, unless you plan on going for super power-hungry cans, the A2 is good with most anything else you throw at it. Unlike some tube amps, you pretty much get the unaltered sound of your headphones, so it's not ideal for taming an overly bright headphone for example. But if you want clean solid state sound I find it quite good with almost everything (with the few exceptions listed above).

Upon further listening, I am pleased to say that I will be keeping my Asgard 2. On well-recorded songs, it makes the soundstage even better, which really makes the music sound more lively. It's sort of annoying how only like 40% of CDs released today are "well-recorded". It amazes me how flexible this amp is, with the gain switch and all, while still being so well built. I think it's a bargain with the five-year warranty and build quality. Even if it's only $249 of amp (I don't have much experience with other amps so I can't give my opinion on this), it's so well built that it'll last a very long time, which easily justifies the asking price.
 
I also observed that it is really useless to use it with lower quality headphones like the Sennheiser HD 558s and Beyerdynamic Custom One Pros. The Custom One Pros sound better directly hooked up to my computer, to be honest. But when I use it with my DAC and DT 990s it clearly helps. The built in amp on my DAC is more than powerful enough, but as I stated before the soundstage is narrower and it just is slightly less detailed. Just my two cents, although I'd take them with a grain of salt considering this is my first dedicated headphone amplifier.

I was working LATE really last night and was tired of wearing headphones so I put in my Westone W40's and plugged them into the A2 on low gain. I was listening to two new albums I had downloaded from B&W's Society of Sound (FLAC 24/48) and it sounded so amazing that it kept distracting me from work. I finally said to Hell with it and leaned back in my chair and put my feet up on my desk and just listened for a half hour or so. Its nice to know that the Westone's are capable of sounding much better than I thought they were. 
 
I LOVE my Lyr, but the Asgard 2 works better for me when I'm using my easier to drive headphones like the B&W P7's or most of my IEM's. The A2 is a wonderful amp and a sweet preamp at a great price. Now if you feed it so-so source material you'll not be that impressed with what it gives you, but with a good DAC and well recorded music its almost impossible to beat anywhere near its price in my opinion. Plus, it runs warm to hot like a real "Class A" design is supposed to.

I think it's likely that my source is too quiet, although I have no clue how to fix it. Last night I was using a Yamaha CD player that has an adjustable output, and I had it set to the lowest, hence the Asgard picking up the slack and being almost to the max. I experimented with different settings on each and found the Asgard was the best even on full. Don't worry, I wasn't frying my ears. With my DAC hooked up to my computer it's much lower, but my DAC doesn't have adjustable line outs. 
 
Do class As sound better than ABs? The Asgard generates much more heat, so is that heat serving a purpose or is it just "for show"? 
 
It's good to hear that the Asgard works well with high quality IEMs. As before, I am amazed how well it works with my DT 990s but it actually sounds a little worse than the built in output with my HD 558s and Custom One Pros, but that isn't a concern since those don't really need an amplifier.

The only full Class A amps I've heard in my system were headphone amps...Class A speaker amps are like space heaters, are usually very heavy and very expensive. Both of my speaker amps are from Parasound, the A21 and A23 and they're both high bias Class A/AB designs. The first X amount of watts are Class A and then they slide into AB. There's no doubt at all that a Class AB amp can sound great...it comes down to design, parts quality and execution. 
 
I only meant that so many amps are called "Class A" yet they're cool/slightly warm to the touch. I've been at this since the mid 80's and Class A has always meant "to me" that the amp will run very warm to hot. I don't care if my amps are powered by hamsters running on a belt as long as they sound good to me. The Asgard 2 sounds very nice to me...without the use of hamsters. (to the best of my knowledge)

Couple thoughts:
 
Output impedance is an important spec, but I think it's slightly overrated.  Yes, I know all about damping factor.  But, just because something is a better technical match, it doesn't mean it always sounds the best to the user.  My TEAC HA-501 has variable output impedance (0.4 ohm to 5 ohm), and I've found that both my high impedance Sennheisers and low impedance SHures sound the best to me when using mid or high output impedance.  It's slightly more euphonic.
 
Balanced headphone amps offer more power and slightly lower noise.  That's about it.  I've seen arguments both pro and con about how balanced supposedly sounds different than single-ended, but there's really no objective consensus.  I think it comes down to this: if you need more power, for say orthos, balanced -can provide that.  Other than that, single-ended will satisfy most of the users out there, and I'm guessing most people would fail a volume matched double blind study when using an amp that provides both single-ended and balanced output.

So I have always been skeptical of using IEMs with any home audio equipment, and 1/8 to 1/4 adapters seem dubious to me at best. Last night I tried my Bowers & Wilkins  C5s (only really use them with my iPhone) with my Asgard 2. I tried two separate adapters and got the sense that the connection wasn't right because the sound was shallow and quiet. Even after turning the volume pot to 2 on low gain I couldn't hear much, and the sound I did hear had no bass or highs. I don't know why they weren't connecting properly, especially since I tried two adapters.
 
Of note is that this was with that CD player that was giving me trouble and making me put the volume at 3-4 for my DT 990s. I will try again with my computer tonight and see if the IEMs work as they should. Does anyone have any idea if I was doing something wrong?
 
This CD player is a real trouble maker. You can adjust the output level, even for the optical out. Wouldn't this require the use of an amplifier inside the CD player? If so, this would be double amping and reduce the sound quality, so why would Yamaha do it? 
 
Thanks for any help, it's nice to see so many fellow enthusiasts on here.

Are you saying that the B&W C5's don't really benefit from using a home headphone amp or most IEM's in general won't benefit?
 
The reason I ask is because I plugged my Westone W40's into the Asgard 2 a couple nights ago (can't recall if the DAC was the Gungnir or Bryston BDA-1...Gungnir I think) and I was surprised how much better the W40's sound from that setup than from my E12 and X3 playing the exact same music files (FLAC and WAV only...about half of which are 24/96 and 24/192). I do realize the money difference between the portable and home setup, but I thought the W40's were close to maxed out on sound quality via the FiiO X3 and E12 but I was wrong. They certainly did significantly better with the nicer DAC and amp.
 
Anyway, I've had my eye on the C5's after seeing them at my local Best Buy and have thought about picking up a pair. At their price do you find them to be a good deal? Thanks.

=============================================

It made enough of an improvement in sound quality that it got my attention right away even though I was listening mainly just for background music. I had zero expectations beyond what I'd already heard from the W40's and that I'd be more comfortable without headphones sitting on my head.
 
The thing is I was working at the time (it was getting late) and I was tired of wearing headphones so I put in my W40's and plugged them in and got back to work yet the sound I was now hearing was distracting. I'm not saying that the Westone W40's are the greatest thing since sliced bread, simply that "I thought" I had already heard all they had had to offer until plugging them into the A2 and I was surprised by the improvement. To me this is a good thing, this tells me that the W40's are capable of more than had thought they were.
 
I wasn't excepting the C5's to sound better than the W40's...I like B&W speakers a lot and I really enjoy their P7's and I've never had the chance to hear the C5's.

I'm curious to see what your finding are. I like the E12 a lot, its my primary portable amp...I don't know that its the equal of the Asgard 2 but its certainly a great amp for the money. Of course, the DAC is rather important here too, I enjoy the FiiO X3 (my primary DAP) but I don't know that anyone claims that its on par with the Gungnir or the Bryston BDA-1. Low price digital is getting pretty damn good. 
 
Anyway, I was simply saying that I was surprised by the level of sound quality I was getting from the W40's by plugging them into the office setup after thinking I had a handle on what they were capable of. The post I was responding to commented that the C5's and/or IEM's didn't seem to improve much from being used with home audio gear. Maybe in most case he's correct, I don't know, I simply know that the W40's sounded noticeably better from my office setup than from my portable setup. I don't think that's too outlandish a statement.
 
I think ones state of mind when they're listening matters as well, I was working and NOT listening for an improvement from my IEM's but they certainly got my attention. I look forward to your findings with the A/B switch and both amps. Take care.

=============================================

I've had the C5s for 3 years. I was going through a pair of earbuds every 3-6 months (cable rips, earbud died, etc.) and the apple store has always been great at offering a return. The build quality of the C5s is incredible. For the price, the sound quality is mediocre, but better than anything I've ever heard for IEMs (which isn't much). I would've described it at the best sounding earbuds out there until I got my DT 990s and other home components. I think the C5s are amazing to just use with your iPhone and no DAC or amp, because I think that's what they're meant for. So if that's what you're buying them for then I strongly recommend them. I use double flanged tips from a third party, so I would recommend trying third party tips. The fit with them is hit and miss, but if you get them to fit then you'll like them. When I'm out and about I wouldn't hear the difference anyway due to external noise and not fully focusing on music, so I couldn't justify spending anymore on IEMs anyway since I wouldn't get any benefit. At home I like the comfort of full size headphones, so the C5s are my portable pair. They are great for this in my opinion, and if you are looking for something similar I think you'll be pleased. The most amazing thing about them is the soundstage, I just wasn't getting as good of one with other earbuds. Although I'm sure the Westones blow the C5s out of the water. But I've never heard the Westones so I can't compare them. Just don't buy the C5s expecting to use them with home equipment and be amazed, because at the price point they're at I don't think they are designed for that.
 
I hope that helps, if you have any other questions about them feel free to ask.

I just gave it a quick shot, ahh the temptation. I used my HE-500's which need some measure of power. I had my Asgard 2 on high gain with the volume at 11 O'Clock, which is a touch on the loud side for most people. I volume matched the E12. I did a quick listen with the choral in Beethoven's 9th 4th movement and some fusion jazz.
Damn E12 sounded great. I'll have to listen more carefully when I have some more time to see how it handles peak dynamics. Flipping the switch didn't reveal any differences and I really like that Asgard 2. I've been A/B comparing all sorts of amps and I'm begining to feel that this field is overloaded with excessive imagination. There are amps that sound like crap but those a poorly designed and not a good representation of the field at large.
I didn't compare the noise with sensitive IEMs or SQ with higher impedance cans like my HD600's, I'll have to listen more carefully for IM and TIM (Transient Intermodulation Distortion) but so far the damn thing works better than anyone might expect. Contrary to what some folks say about soundstage limitations, that didn't pan out, but I will listen more carefully to be more certain of this The HE-500's require more power than most typical headphones and the E12 did a good job of it. If one tries an HE-6, neither amp can really deliver enough power, but that's in a smaller field of power hungry cans.
It is vital to match volume very carefull or else one will hear differences due to the way we perceive FR at different volumes (Fletcher-Munson). Fail to match it one wrong way and you might think the E12 sounds better.

Cool-hope you like the Rotel. It's been good with my little system. The DAC/amp combo seemed perfect for people like me. I've incorporated Sonos wireless speakers in my house including my dedicated stereo. I figured-I could access all of my digitized music from a hard drive NAS, utilize the DAC in the integrated amp and with a remote, easily move from my digitized music or streaming sources to my CD's without switching cables, etc. Super convenient.
 
 
But, now I think it's messing up my chain when listening to HPs.  I decided to run a little test tonight connecting my A-2 to the three different sources:
 
1. directly to the CDP and removing the integrated amp from the picture (but losing the ability to access my digital files)
2. to the integrated amp
3. to the integrated amp headphone jack
 
I spent a good bit of time tonight listening to a variety of music: rock, jazz, classical, electronic, metal.
 
Findings:
 
*It seems to sound best directly to the CDP removing the integrated from the picture. But, it's inconvenient when I want to quickly move from digitized music to CDs. I have my stereo in my computer room. Sometimes, I just want to spend a few minutes on the computer and not fool with physical media. Boom-I can just easy listen to a playlist through my speakers or HP's via SONOS, then switch to a CD very easily.
 This was a surprise because I had always assumed the DAC in the lower end CDP would result in inferior sound.
 
*There is very little difference between the integrated HP jack and listening thru my A-2 connected to the integrated amp which is frustrating. I'm beginning to think I'm mostly hearing the Rotel not the A-2 when listening to the A-2 connected thru the integrated.
 
Maybe an external, dedicated DAC would have better for HP listening than the amp/DAC combo.
 
Thanks for all of your input.

There's an idea. I guess the rhetorical question would be how much of an upgrade would it be from the little Wolfson DAC that's in my $200 CDP? No way to know.
 
I'm just starting to do a little research. 
 
I might  spring for a new CD player and be done with it,
 
or
 
get a Modi, Bifrost or other Schiit and see how it affects the CDP sound. Pound for pound the Bifrost seems to be one of the better bang for bucks.
 
 I'm  even toying with saving up a bit and replacing my CDP with a CD transport and external DAC for something more endgamish...but that will be a while. The Music Fidelity M series looks good. An audio store I frequent has their M1CD transport and M1DAC. I've heard that combo with Monitor Audio speakers and a Music fidelity amp which sounded quite good. We're talking a year out maybe.

But, something I can live with for a while.....
 
I'm not opposed to wait until the time is right. My strategy has always been have something medium fi you can live with and then keep options open.
 
Good thing, is I've got a serviceable system to listen while the journey continues.

I listen to a lot of heavy music in addition to jazz and inde, etc. So one of the guys who'se very active on the Headfi "metal" thread and is a big collector posted that the newly remastered Zep I is a  signficant improvement. I poked online-here's the poop. Jimmy P has been threatening to remaster their entire catalog. As you guys stated, the previous remasters (I've got the 90's Anthology version) were pretty notoriously bad.
 
In somewhat of a cash grab (IMO), theyre' releasing some sort of box set or compilation for each studio album-with the remastered album and a second disc ( I think) of alternate takes or something to that affect. And, they've also released it as a HD download but not cheap.
 
The Headfier was so impressed he said it almost sounded like Jimmy may have re-recorded some guitar or remixed the album but he wasn't sure. He said the drums, bass all improved.
 
Maybe, if we're lucky (fans, that is) this is the real deal.
 
Right now-they've just released Zep I, II and III.
 
I'll probably pick up I myself as I love that album. It's been yeasrs since I've owned Led Z one, two or three (having their 90's remaster series and a bunch of live stuff).

Would be worth it!
 
I have the following versions of LZ I:
1980s Barry Diament Masters
1994 Box Set (Grey Box)
2008 Box Set (The Japanese Mini-LP Remasters - Though I have the US release, so they are NOT SHM-CDs, but the same Remaster as the SHM-CD Japanese Mini-LP Remasters)
200g Classic Records
180g Classic Records (someone else's 192/24 rip, I never owned the 180g Version)
 
and
 
2014 Deluxe Box Set - I haven't opened it, dont think I will. Prob will buy the standard LPs to listen to instead.
2014 Deluxe CD Version 
2014 Remaster HDTracks 96/24 Version
 
I gotta say, they new remasters (both the CD and HDTracks - when ripped, the CD actually has a few tracks with a higher DR than the HDTracks version) blow away all other versions. I feel like the HDTracks version is the best sounding of the two, but the difference between the CD and HD is slight, slight enough that the difference could be in my head.
 
Next up would be the 2008 Remasters, which are awesome as well, they just have a tad bit noise and tad bit less detail than the 2014s. The Classic Records 200g/180g are right up here too: they dont have quite the detail or dynamic range as the 2014 masters, but they are definitely awesome, and have a certain LP charm that puts them on par with the 2008 Remasters.
 
From here, I prefer the Diament Masters, which have the widest dynamic range, but definitely sound like their age: you can tell they are mastered well, but limited to the tech of the time. The 1994 version is not far behind, cleaner than the Diament Masters, but also a lil bit colder.
 
Long story, still long: the 2014 is def the best sounding Zep yet

Kind of a quick question here.  Is anyone running a tube preamp to the Asgard 2 and would it make any sense to do so?  Just curiosity as I'm unsure about using a Valhalla 2 as a preamp.  If I do get it, I'll be preamping to my Audiosource Amp 100 and my pair of ARX A2rx-c speakers.  I've never heard the so called tube sound before but I've also not heard anything bad about it.  I'm certain something I listen to would be benefited from it.
I've got the Bifrost Uber + Magni at the moment and I'm considering the A2.  I'm also considering the Valhalla 2 to delve into my first tube amp.  My headphones are only HD 598s so upgrading the amp isn't really necessary, but I occasionally want to use IEMs and I could really use the low gain setting.  Until I get the funds for a HD 650 or more ideally a HD 700 I'm just toying around with the idea of a better amp now to power whatever I feel like playing with later and giving me a little more flexability in my choice of ear-wear.
 
So far I'm about 80% sure of getting the A2 but before I sneak some funds to have an equal sized stack I want to have my homework done.  As the other heads up my main listening is to video games (Diablo 3 & World of Warcraft - I already love the soundstage in Diablo 3.  It is greatly improved with the Uber over my onboard.  No I don't use the 3d effects for headphone or gaming functions from software or a sound card.) and after that I do a lot of rock, metal, rap, and classical.  I also enjoy youtube videos of guitarists, drummers, street artists, and singers.  It's a wide range of things.

I've still several types of cans to try out.  I'm wondering if anyone here is using a tube preamp into the Asgard 2 (I'm hoping someone here has both the Valhalla 2 and the Asgard 2 and is either doing that, or is willing to try it for a few song listens and can tell if there's a difference.  I'm planning on getting them both at some point, and if the Valhalla 2 sounds "good" I'll likely use it as a preamp into my speaker setup if not as my primary headphone amp.  I've heard the Asgard 2 is "faster" and since I do enjoy rock/metal when I choose to listen to music I'm considering getting both amps regardless - I'm just not sure if using a tube amp as the preamp into the A2 would be benficial or if that would "slow it down" making the whole idea pointless. (wierd thought process, but I'm still new to the headphone listening thing.  I've primarily always just had bookshelf speakers, but since the wifes computer is 5 feet behind me I don't want to disturb her with loud listening.  So I've started using the headphones a LOT more.  Ever since I got my dedicated external setup my 598's have just come alive and I LOVE it.  So the addiction has started)

I've been reading so many replies and reviews how the O2, Magni and Vali sound the same. After weeks of listening to all of them, (yes I have them all) they are all not exactly the same . I've been using the same music and all else in the system is the same and have only changed the amps. Started with O2, then went to Magni. Yes the Magni and O2 sound very close. The Magni does sound a tad processed and thin compared to O2 but the Magni does have more authority as it is more powerful in comparison even though they all seem to struggle reproducing the source.
 
Then I went to the Vali. The Vali sounds nothing like the others. It's slightly more smoother and warmer, more of a natural sound but ever so slightly, and more realistic sounding. I was enjoying it very much for weeks. Then I decided to get the Asgard 2. Why? I read so much about it I just had to try it. The Vali also seem to struggle reproducing the source which makes sense as it's less powerful.
 
I have to say the Asgard 2 is is not like any of the others. Why have some said there is no difference? I'm suspecting what is happening is that people are not using high resolution (or not high enough resolution) tracks or headphones to distinguish the difference OR they just don't hear the difference due to their hearing biology. As a side note: I also did an electronic spectrum hearing test to verify my hearing at different frequencies to eliminate that factor, and I passed 100%. 
 
The Asgard 2; is in a whole other class. The Asgard 2 with the same headphones (HE-400) sound way more detailed, realistic, bassier, deeper, smoother and wider is the best way to explain it with all else in the system being the same. The Mids seem more forward and lush. The Asgard 2 does not appear to add any color to the sound, but I may say on a scale from 1-100% if I had to say how much I think it does add coloration, maybe 10-20% which is not relevant to be considered significant, it's a really tiny amount but pleasant. The gain is also contributing to the level of authority also as it does have more gain than all the others even though it's also rated at 32 ohms at 1.0W RMS.
 
As for noise (hiss); No hiss at any volume level either on High or Low gain either connected or not connected to a source with HE-400, so if you have higher impedance headphones there should be no worries.
 
As for humming; it's there, but like others have stated, it's barely noticeable to non existent and that is a huge exaggeration even, at least for my model. My findings are this; you have to be in a dead silent room and paste your ear on the chassis right over the transformer to hear it and even then it's so tiny of a sound there is no way anyone can hear this humming unless they are intentionally trying to hear it. Even if you put your ear on top of the amp over the grill area or to the side where the transformer is located, you can't hear it still. If your ear is 1" away from the same location you just can't possibly hear it unless you are super human! Shiit has done an excellent job in resolving this issue as others have stated overall.
 
As for the volume knob getting warm, it's true but nothing unbearable. But here is a tip if it really bothers you or yours gets possibly hotter than you like. I have done this with all my Shiit amps but not due to heat issues but just ease of turning the volume knob. Get 3 O-rings that are a tad smaller in diameter than the volume knob and stretch them over the volume knob.  On the Asgard 2 it makes it easier to turn the volume knob also but the added advantage is you won't feel any heat off the knob. Plus it looks nice too!
 
My serial is 002026 so I would hope all higher models do not have any of these issues or that they don't creep back into production. So for anyone that is thinking about the Asgard 2, YES it's worth it. You WILL hear a difference with respect to what was mentioned above about headphones, music quality rate and biology. This amp just sound like an actual amp, it sounds "real" while the others mentioned sound like they're struggling to making an effort to process the sound, but the Asgard 2 seems to do it effortlessly with authority is another nice way to describe it. 
 
I hope this helps anyone who maybe interested in the Asgard 2. 
 
Cheers.

I also compared my Magni with the Asgards 2 and they sounded the same. Well there goes the theory that the Magni is bright sounding. That A/B switch is worth its weight in gold. The morale of the story is that unless your driving an unusual headphone, like a power hungry HE-6, most amps do a great job. Yes of course there are some turkeys out there, but there are more great sounding amps than many of us realize or are willing to admit. If the amp can drive the load, chances are it's going to sound A OK. Yes, turkeys need not apply.

One guy claims the Asgard 2 and Magni sounds the same, so it HAS to be true. Even more so because he has an A/B switch! Oh and they measure flat.
I honestly have no clue how anyone could hear the two as sounding the same. Almost no amps ever sound the same to me. I wish they did. No, there is not like a night and day difference usually.
The only time I got a near identical sound was with the Vali and Headroom Micro with the Q701. When switching headphone the results were way different.
Ifi Ican and my Micro Amp are also pretty close in sound. I've found those to be a better all-rounder then the O2, which is supposedly neutral/transparent.
 
I think the general consensus since the Magni came out is that it's a little thin and bright. Basically still neutral. Doesn't mean it's bad. Perhaps Schiit did some sort of silent update, but probably not. I just have to disagree that they sounded the same. That is all..
 
I know some have said it's not bright at all and sort of warm. Mine had about zero warmth.
 
Had the Asgard 1 for years before selling it and it definitely sounded nothing like the Magni. I also had the Asgard 2, but found the Magni to sound better. The Asgard sound is just not for me. I'd have loved it with a DT-880/990 perhaps. Some have said the Asgard(1) has a "warm and analog" sound and I would agree with this. Maybe some hear the Magni just like that. I just can't imagine this! I did like the Asgard 1 with the HD-600 and D2000. It seems almost made for those.
 
I could easily take 2-3 headphones and get two amps to sound the same. IMO the HD-600 and HD-598 sound nearly identical on every amp without much change. The HD-650 seems to improve a little more when I made gear changes, but it still manages to sound great on almost everything as long as it's fairly neutral.
 
Comparing amps with an HD-600 is kind of silly actually. What's the point. I often could hear more changes with my old KRKs and DJ100 than the HD-600.
 
Another BTW, many of the amps i've had sort of changed their tune with different headphones. For example, the Vali was terrible with my HD-650/DJ100, but amazing with the Q701.
My Bravo V2 is also great with the HD-650 but hates the Q701. Same with the O2 mostly. I really don't like that much with the Q701.
 
Oh yeah, for hearing gear changes I found the DT-880/T90 extremely good for this. The T90 was the only time where I felt the Modi was holding it back a little and that's one amazing DAC for the price. I can't imagine what the T1 or HD-800 is like.

It's quite possible I guess. Not saying you're wrong. Is yours a very early Magni? Mine was.
I think I got it on day 1 of it's release. I kept it for maybe a year and ended up swapping it for an O2.
Maybe there was slight tweaks to it's sound.
 
Prefer the O2 overall, but think the Modi is better than the ODAC (nearly identical there IMO).
 
I'm quite fond of the Modi+O2 combo 
 
I just need to find the perfect Schiit amp for both my DJ100, HD-650 and Q701. This has been a real challenge! Guess it's probably the Lyr 2.
 
BTW I'd say the Magni and O2 are much closer in sound to my ears than the Magni and Asgard.
 
Wish I could get the Vali + Q701 sound in solid state. Maybe the Lyr 2 gets close to that?
 
Asgard 2 didn't sound anything like the O2 and I guess that's sometimes a good thing.

The only reason I went for the Asgard 2 was because I didn't want a wall wart, wanted adjustable gain, and liked the aluminum, although it was mainly the first two. I probably wouldn't have even noticed a difference had I went with the Magni. I would just find it hard to justify spending more than $500 on a headphone amplifier. The Schiit Lyr can drive basically anything and is only $449, so anything after that must be just fancier chassis or for balanced. 
 
I will say though that prior to buying the Asgard 2 I tried out Grado's solid state amplifier for $500 at a local audio store and wasn't impressed. It sounded good but not any better than the Asgard 2, and the construction was flimsier, no gain switch and a lot lighter and likely to get dragged around the desk. For DOUBLE the price. I'll be honest if it weren't for this forum I would've thought Schiit was a bunch of scammers for selling what they do for their prices. 
 
Also not having to deal with an audio store was pleasant... they just try to upsell you which is really annoying.

I think it makes sense to spec amps for the HD 800 at 600 Ω, since the HD 800 impedance varies across the frequency range, and busts up over 600 Ω at 150 Hz or so. Still, as StanD points out, A2 should provide ample headroom (190 mW into 600 Ω yielding 125 SPL into an HD 800 by my reckoning). That said, Schiit's own Lyr/2, Mjolnir, and Valhalla/2 all deliver more power into 600 Ω. The V2 rules them all at 800 mW, 131 SPL for the HD 800 (!). Nearly double the power of Sennheiser's own HDVA 600 at 480 mW. The V2 isn't supposed to be particularly "tubey" sounding, but whatever sonic difference it poses vs. A2 might suit HD 800. So I suspect the V2 is the more ideal match for HD 800, but the A2 will drive it just fine, along with lots of other headphones, for some of which the V2 would be ill-suited.

Not many people post about HD800 and Asgard 2
 
So... Ill try to help since when i was looking I didn't find much. 
 
First of all Asgard 2 is warm sounding the mids are pushed up a few db and the bass is a bit too, im 100% about this plz don't argue :p
 
Soo HD800's problem is that it has a 6k peak and the asgard 2 doesn't bring it down... Soooo if u don't like that then Asgard 2 isn't the best.
But If you like how the HD800 sounds then.... Yes the asgard 2 sounds really good. You get WAY more than enough volume dynamic is very good. and that's about all. 
 
I have heard many set ups and to be honest Asgard 2 Bifrost + HD800 probably gets you 90-95% there (009=100%)
 
just a small note HD800 sounds nice but its not something you can use for 5 hours because of the treble peaks(your ears gets tired), for that you should get LCDs.

I'd bet that the Valhalla 2 would make for a sweet sounding single source preamp too.
 
I tried my LD MKIII for a while as a preamp to my Parasound A21 and it sounded incredible but it wasn't long until the A21 started shutting itself off for a second or two at a time (protection circuit) as its a direct coupled amp and the MKIII "may" have had some leaky capacitors. Possibly the issue was related to something else but once I went back to either my Creek passive or my regular preamp I had no more problems with the Parasound...either way, I loved the sound of the tube preamp in the chain. **No doubt I was suffering from a preconceived bias/a concussion/hearing loss or possibly the flu, since we all know that tube gear sounds no different than solid state yet I truly LOVED what that combo did for well recorded vocals** 
 
Enjoy your music.

Haha, well no, I don't have any of that. And unless someone is willing to let me borrow theirs, I have to simply carefully adjust the volume myself and take a second to switch back and forth so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. It took me about 12 or 13 rounds to get the volume right, but I think I've got it dead on. I don't notice the bass difference so much but yes, the top end is surprisingly different depending on the volume, which is how I'm gauging whether or not I've gotten the volumes right.
 
I actually got an O2 in this evening and I've been going back and forth between it and Asgard 2 at random while I'm browsing the internet/working, with HD650 and next up Westone 2. So far, I've gotten through Death Grips' Exmilitary (ok, not the best production quality), and Leitmotif by Dredg. The differences between them certainly aren't huge or apparent as I frequently forget which one I'm listening to. I think I hear a difference, but I'm not saying what until I'm more positive.

Don't waist your money unless you just have an itch. I will tell you that the Asgard 2 is already better than the 02. Save your money.
 
This amp pumps out better than any battery powered, wall-wart amp. I have the 02, the Magni and the Vali. Some people need a lot of time with them all (if they even own them) to tell the difference and even then people say they can't tell the difference as they just can't hear it, not that "it's" not there, just that we all hear differently and see differently and feel differently but I assure you there is a difference. I've spent hours with them all and I mean weeks on end going from one to the next.
 
The issue lies in that different headphones with different amps don't match for many different reasons, but if your headphones are within the specs of what the amp's specs calls for you should be good but once again that does not make it the amps limitation if the headphones don't match the amp. But I guess you can look at it as the amp don't like the headphones too but I have to say amps are more commonly designed than headphones are so I have to lean on the side that headphones make more of a difference in this price range than an amp with respect to the Schiit line.

Just as actual self and perceptual self; you may think (not you Otheronek) that you are a great person that is perceptual self. Actual self is how everyone see's you which is realistic, which means if 1,000 people say you are a great person then you are as that many people can't be wrong as the masses hold true. It's all about statistics to a point.
 
So if majority people have already stated the Asgard 2 sounds better than the 02 that's pretty much the same thing as I'm another user that adds to the numbers. But in the end what is best for you is what is best for YOU and only you. But I will stand by that the Asgard 2 is better than the 02 easily and the Magni and the Vali regardless if people can hear it or not, because if they can't hear it I feel sorry for them because they are missing out what is really there but since they can't hear it they will dismiss it. O well, their loss. If others can hear it and others can't it makes you then question these individuals who state they can't hear it when way more say they can. Who is right and who is not? Let that sink in.
 
Asgard 2 is great, I know people that say they can't hear it....Ok, but I'm glad I didn't take their word for it.

Buy once, cry once I always say. I never buy used as you don't know what the history of the device was and you always take a risk. Buy new and if there is something wrong it's factory wrong and it will be handled or replaced which is rarer than used. People are sneaky I've learned. They abuse or misuse devices and then want to sell them.
 
At my local electronics store I purchased a used motherboard for a PC build. It was open box and I was told nothing was wrong with it and the previous customer returned is as "didn't need it or want it." Well I could not get the board to read the CPU. I returned to store to exchange for another retuned/used one. Same thing. I went through 5 boards and they all failed so I finally decided to buy a new one. For the $30.00 I was trying to save it was a waste of time.
 
Later I found out was that mother board was a HOT board that people like to buy and overclock for gaming and they set it up wrong and blow the board. So that the store does not refuse their return, these people returned it and claim they didn't need it, got their money back or store credit and later bought it again. I was buying the blown boards! I've learned my lesson. 
 
Peace.

Guys, for me the A2 is on the wanted list, however, I have read some reviews where some people have said that the A2 is just " good enough but there are better amps out there" this has put some doubt in my audiophile over priced is always better head about the A2's ability. Here is what I listen for 
1. to be musical and tuneful and Fun
2. not be be harsh at the top end
3. controlled and musical Bass
4. great on vocals
the front end will be PC win 8.1>JRiver>Bifrost Uber>A2 or Burson Soloist SL> VMODA XS
 
if i get the A2 and it is as good as the Schiits DAC then i have a lot left for a really good set of cans like Audeze 2.2, Alpha Dogs, TH 900 or TH 600 and i am not sure on the cans at all ie which ones will work best with the A2

With all due respect, as good as it gets is a little high praise. Don't get me wrong I love Schiit gear, owned the Valhalla, the Asgard 2 and still own the Gungnir, but the A2 is not as good as it gets. At the price point it is a very good headphone amplifier and it is difficult to not see the excellent price/performance value it brings to the table. However, I sold mine soon after as I needed more capability and drive for my 560. The A2 was good, but as much as I love Schiit gear, and I do, the Yulong A18 I replaced the A2 with is certainly a more capable amplifier pretty much across the board. My Auditor was also another solid state amp that was clearly a better performer than the A2 as well across the board. That said, these are subjective view points and I would never for a moment say that the A2 isn't a great amp at a very good price, but it is not as good as it gets.

I'd really question putting the money into a Bifrost Uber and an Asgard 2 to use with a V-Moda XS. Not to say the XS isn't good, as it probably is, but it was likely designed for use with smartphones and isn't going to benefit as much as some other headphones will. You might be better off investing in a different pair of headphones first. 
 
Also, I heard the Grado amplifier that retails for $500 briefly, and the sound wasn't any better that I remembered. I only listened to it briefly so I don't want to comment much on the sound. What I will comment on is that the Asgard 2 is way more durable, has a way better volume pot, has a way better warranty and also has outputs for speakers. At half the price of the Grado Schiit is able to deliver similar audio quality (in my opinion) and way more features (fact). I'm sure there are better amps out there but I doubt there are any for under $500. 
 
It saddens me to think that people dismiss this product because the price isn't astronomical. Schiit should be getting props for delivering products at reasonable prices, not lost sales.

Just to update you guys I have bought a NuForce HA 200, I was able to demo it in Dubai, it was very close between HA 200 and the A2.HA 200 Cost was $350 the Schiits A2 would be approx.  the same cost including the shipping. this amp is very much the similar to the A2 a SS class A amp but with one main difference that the HA 200 can be used in balanced mono block configuration allowing for upgrade path should wife ahem i mean Life allow such things in future (God Willing). I do agree with most of the comments about not judging something by its low price. as i have had and used the Bifrost for the last 3 years and am very pleased with its performance, I also have a Loki too so i do Like Schiits Schiit a lot too. and the XS'sss were bought to use as portable cans for use with a phone, however these are the only cans i have as i cannot work out which ones i want. Apha Dogs, Fostex TH 900, TH 600 or Audeze 2.2 thanks for the advise it was all good and helped me to keep it real

I do, but was never able to fully research it's validity...  Some people swear it's true, while others swear it wasn't...  Just another of the unanswered mysteries of life that keep us young!  :-)
 
By the way, did any of you ever notice that during your burn-in, the headphones and/or amp actually got LOUDER?  
 
I wasn't expecting that, and my wife SWEARS she hasn't touched the volume knob.  But it is definitely and considerably louder than it was in the first 24 hours running the same source files!  (And to let her off the hook, I confirmed that the volume knob's fastening screw is indeed still in the 9 o'clock position...)
 
I walked by while the Hans Zimmer collection part of the burn-in loop was running and thought to myself, "Did I leave on the speakers a little too?" and was surprised to find that it was all the headphones!  (Turned it down right away!)  The gain was already on HIGH, and I had heard the difference between low and high already, so I know the gain switch wasn't in the LOW position...
 
Weird.  (SOUNDS AWESOME THOUGH!)

I happen to compare the Asgard 2 with a friends Musical Fidelity M1HPAP paired with my Gungnir Gen2 USB while playing lossless tracks that I'm very familiar with and I too preferred the Asgard 2. I find it to be the most neutral headphone amp anywhere near its price (that I've heard) and like the MF M1HPAP it makes for a sweet sounding single source preamp. I've used it as a preamp at one time or another with the Parasound A21 and A23 and it works great with either one...that's a pretty sweet trick for its retail price. I haven't heard any obvious warmth yet that may be due do using a different source or source material. Regardless, I'm of the opinion that the Asgard 2 is one of the best bargains on the market right now. If you don't require more power its very, very hard to beat...kinda like most of Schiit Audio's lineup. These guys are kicking ass right now and I'm loving it.

I agree. To be honest, I was very skeptical at first. I kind of thought that Schiit as a company was over-hyped because they're so involved in the head-fi community, and therefore a lot of people relate to them more and automatically buy and like their products more. But I was very surprised to see that this is a VERY serious product (despite the silly name) in every sense of the word, it's what I like to call a finished product, it feels like someone put a lot of effort into making sure all the most important aspects are perfect. The price is almost unreal considering the performance and build quality....and on top of all that it has a 5 year warranty. Definitely a very positive thing to happen in a hi-fi world that is usually full of snobbery and prices pumped up just for the sake of making something more exclusive and less available.

Gentlemen and Gentleladies,
 
I have an announcement:
 
 
That feeling I had when I was a little boy, and I had done something really good, (or my dad was just in the mood to pamper me...) when he would sit me up in the deep velour recliner and put "The CANs" on my head and let me listen to some Ohio Players, Temptations, John Denver, or Wilson Picket?  They just came back in an BIG way today!
 
Today the 24-hour pre-charging of my iFi iDSD Micro's battery finished, and I switched it in for the FIIO e17 I had been using as a DAC into the ASGARD 2.  Noticeable difference when I started using the e17 over what I got straight from the home theater PC, so I was pretty happy until today.  My intention was to use the iDSD Micro mobile since it works directly with APPLE devices with just the Camera Connection Kit, and keep the e17 in the entertainment center sound chain, but now...
 
Wow.  The ASGARD 2 made the HD-650s come alive, but now with better source capability of FULL DSD high-bit files played natively and what I can only call a more "Finished" sounding DAC even with the same FLAC files I've been playing with the e17, the HD-650s just "Sing"!
 
I just bought Mahler's Symphony no. 5 in C Sharp Minor as a multi-channel DSD from ChannelClassics.com last night, and the experience just now when I heard it for the first time was just unreal!  Suddenly, I was a happy 6-year old boy sneaking some time on Dad's recliner and lost in the music again for the first time in over 4 decades... 
 
Asgard 2 and iDSD Micro fed by jRiver Media Center have awesome synergy.  I wasn't in any way expecting or prepared for how this would sound. 
 
You MUST hear the ASGARD 2 fed from a REALLY good source to even get a glimpse of what it is capable of.  The built-in amp in the iDSD Micro is excellent, and gives the ASGARD 2 a good chase in terms of power output, (The iFi is now easily the 2nd most powerful amp mobile or otherwise in the house.)  but the ASGARD 2 just opens up the soundstage a little wider, more "naturally", and puts more "weight" to the music.  More of the complexity seems to come forward to my ears.
 
I hope that someone finds this of value.  If I had just done this in the first place, I could have saved myself a LOT of time and money on components trying to get here.  But that said; 1 - each step taught me something, and 2 - I thought I was "Done" as I loved the sound I was getting when I bought the ASGARD 2!
 
...Bummer...  Now I have to buy another iDSD Micro for travel again...   LOL  (Both iDSD Micros will still be cheaper by more than half the cost of 1 Chord Hugo though!)

I have been plugging all of my audio equipment into UPS units that have "TRUE SINE WAVE" power signatures.  Combo of Eaton and APC.
 
For my smaller power-draw devices:  Eaton 5125 "1500" Technical Specifications here: http://www.powerprosinc.com/Eaton-5125/
 
For my larger power-draw devices: APC SUA2200XL Technical Specifications here: http://www.apc.com/products/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=SUA2200XL
 
My ASGARD 2, Home Theater PC (Foobar 2000 or JRiver 20 Media Center software), and DAC run off the Eaton
The HD Television (Major reason why you MUST use a true "SINE WAVE" UPS otherwise you may get dangerous "power pulses" when running off battery power!) and surround sound setup all run off of one of our APC SUA2200XL chassis behind the Entertainment wall.
 
To be clear, in both our old apartment, and now in our house, we have never experienced power issues or noise/interference from power contamination with this setup.
Before we had it, we lost a lot of equipment to a power surge from a lightning strike, so I will never allow our high-end gear to be plugged directly into a wall socket again.  Its' a PAIN and large cost to replace all of it.  Large enough that it justified putting commercial-grade UPSes in place.  Expensive?  Yes.  But still cheaper to own than risking immediate or long-term intermittent damage troubleshooting headaches from a power spike.  And after we lost lost power for 3 days after last year's hurricane, it was AWESOME being able to run our bare essentials for all three days and have small lamps powered at night!  (Didn't have a generator when we were still in the apartment last year.)
 
Can you get away with a $1-200 UPS?  Sure.  But if you spend north of $500 on headphones, and north of 10 thousand dollars on your HiFi and Television setup, it seems as silly to me as cutting corners on the protector case for your new $300 + dollar smart phone to save $20-30 on a case that might not protect it from a fall from your coat pocket...  Not to mention that it becomes less likely that will get CLEAN PURE SINE power with very low harmonic distortion, no static or humming noise in that price range.  But more power to you if you find a deal!

By the way, I bolded the "WHEN RUNNING OFF BATTERY POWER" because someone might buy a plain UPS, plug it all up and everything will work fine.  The problem will not show itself until you make the UPS operate under load from its INTERNAL BATTERY.  Then you will likely witness a problem if it is going to happen.  So many have argued that you don't need a true sine wave UPS because their setup "works perfectly" for them.  Problem is: They don't notice the problem until the power goes out for the first time....  Then it's too late.
 
If you want to try a Belkin, Cyberpower, or other basic UPS, just make sure that you TEST IT under load by unplugging the UPS from the wall or cutting a circuit breaker while your devices are running normally.  That's the best way that I've been able to tell if
 
A:  The UPS is able to handle the load
B:  The power supplied will be "clean" with no noise or noticeable distortion
C:  The UPS will run for a sufficient length of time  (TVs and amps draw LOTS of power for a UPS designed for a simple PC or laptop...)
 
Our setup with extended batteries in our media closet adding to the main UPS capacities give us 8 to 12 hours of continuous use.  More than enough to last us 3 or 4 days if we ration power during a prolonged blackout even with recharging our phones and devices and leaving small, high efficiency lamps running when it gets dark.
 
Long story-short:  If you buy a UPS, charge it up overnight, put it under load un plugged from the wall and test if it will perform the WAY you want, FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT.
 
If it doesn't make sure that you buy from a seller who will let you return, or at least trade-up to a grade of UPS that will.  Be prepared to spend money to protect your expensive investments. It may cost you MUCH MORE money and aggravation if you don't.

Maybe the Gungnir would sound better from its XLR outs but at the moment I'm enjoying the Asgard 2 as HP amp and the preamp to a Parasound Halo A23 speaker amp in my office setup. The A2 makes for a sweet sounding single-source "Class A" preamp to your stereo speaker amp. If the Asgard 2 were priced higher than $250 I think it would be taken more seriously by some...which is a shame. My hats off to the guys at Schiit Audio for keeping the prices down while giving you more than your moneys worth. 
 
I haven't even bothered to run balanced out from my preamp to my stereo amp (Parasound A21) at home yet with good source material the background is dead silent. I've run single ended IC's (all short runs...nothing over 1.5 meters) for so long that I've never worried about running the gear from their XLR outputs. I simply try to put together the best system I can (within reason) and then try my best to forget all about the gear and just enjoy the music.
 
I've been at this for a very long time and I spent far too many years worrying if this would sound better than that...listening for differences, but if there were differences were they improvements?...or just differences? I had gotten to the point in which I only listened to my "best sounding" albums and CD's, the ones that really showed off the system. My priorities were out of whack. 
 
One day I found myself enjoying music more from my dead-stock car stereo than my (at the time...mid 90's) $10K home stereo and that is when I knew I had chased the rabbit down the hole and needed to get back to what was truly important. Enjoying music...buying more music.
 
Hope you all have a very Merry Christmas/Festivus/Holidays or whatever you celebrate! 
 
Take care.

... only interested in UK plug users, really. i have a feeling that either the UK is a complete afterthought or cables boxed with hifi items are expected to be swapped out. thing is, UK consumer law contains the principal of being 'fit for purpose' - and if you can't ensure it can be powered reliably and safely, it's simply not. doesn't matter if i could be largely expected to buy into an expensive third party power cable, as the idea is intended to be across-the-board. standardised fittings for power cables (IEC's, for example), despite how reassuring and simplifying this is meant to be, suddenly become a puzzle with indeterminate elements when you find the one apparently selected as the so-called 'most appropriate' doesn't work well enough. so, which one's actually do?! i dunno, personally. seems like a very weak link to me. sets up UK distributor for complicated additional issues as they're expected to take on the responsibility of either correcting the problem or accepting the item can be legally returned for refund - even if people do have other cables to try, the buyer can expect the supplier to solve the issue as part of the cost and conditions of the sale.

Opinion's will vary. My best friend brought over his Musical Fidelity M1HPAP ($800) headphone amp and we compared it to the Asgard 2 (source: the Gungnir Gen2 USB) and we both preferred the Asgard 2. In fact, he ended up selling his Musical Fidelity amp (still a very nice amp) and bought an Asgard 2 for himself and pocketed the extra cash. 
 
I like that the Asgard 2 is a true "Class A" design, has the High and Low output switch as this allows it to not only drive my HE-400's & HE-500's but on Low gain it sounds outstanding with my Westone W40's and B&W P7's. Let's not forget that it also makes for a very sweet sounding preamp. I'm using one right now as a preamp/headphone amp to a Parasound A23 speaker amp and it sounds terrific. There certainly are other great sounding amps on the market, no doubt, I simply haven't found one as nice as the A2, with its feature set at anywhere near its price.
 
Now, if you want the sound of tubes you will want another amp. 
 
Here's a very informative review of the A2 and the Bifrost: http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/headphone-amplifiers/headphone-amplifiers/schiit-asgard-2-headphone-amplifier-and-bifrost-uber-dac-review.html?utm_campaign=website&utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email​

Hi Teddy,
 
I think I've mentioned that I've had success with my iFi iDSD Micro, but I don't think that we've spoken directly about the ASGARD 2.  If you recall from my posts, I LOVE my iDSD Micro.  It just totally astonishes me daily.  In order to beat it, it seems like you'd have to at least go to an Aurrender FLOW (~$1300) or a Chord HUGO (~$2500) in order to clearly surpass it.  But even in my posts, I mention that the iDSD Micro as great as it sounds is still not to the level of performance I get out of the ASGARD 2.  It just sounds amazing.  I've listened to far fewer desktop headphone amps than portable DAC/amps, so I won't ask you to believe that I haven't heard better, because that would be meaningless.  But I WILL tell you that to me, the ASGARD 2 has more than sufficient power, creates a great sense of "space" in orchestral and instrumental music, and eliminates any "Sennheiser veil" that  others seem to run into with other solutions.  Are there CLEARLY better/more powerful amps?  Sure.  Do they also exist in the ~$250.00 price range?  I'm not so sure about that one.  Is the Bottlehead Crack or other amp in the same price range "as good as, but different" than the ASGARD 2?  I sure hope so!  The more choices, the better.  But I CAN tell you that to me ears, the ASGARD 2 is an excellent compliment to the HD-650s.  It has been used EVERY DAY by either my wife or me since we bought it in September.  It has never missed a beat, and never acted up.

The Cayin C5 is a very nice portable amp, but I think you'll find the A2 to be more transparent and allow you to hear more detail than the C5 plus it should sound more dynamic.
 
It's been too long since I've heard the 650's (my son now has them) on the A2, but I have heard the 600's on the Asgard 2 recently and its a great combination. A lot depends on your source, not only your DAC but source files. Of course, even low cost DAC's are getting so good nowadays that you probably have that covered. Just be sure to use good quality source material and I think you'll be very pleased with your results. Keep in mind that Schiit Audio does allow you to return the amp if you're not happy with it. 
 
Like I said before, if you're looking for more of that "tube-like" sound (nothing wrong with that, I love tube amps) then the A2 probably won't be want you're looking for...though the A2 is not a cold sounding solid state amp at all.
 
Good luck!

+1  Love my ASGARD 2.  Not quite a year into them, but getting there, and they've never failed to impress me or family/friends when they visit.  (Full range of Classical fans to "Bass-Head" nephews and nieces.)  Classical/Vocals sounds incredible with the Sennheiser HD-650s (HARD TO FIND AN AMP THAT DRIVES THESE WELL!)  The J-POP, K-POP, DUB-STEP, House/Trance, and American POP listening kids love the Photive PH-BTX6 headphones with the ASGARD 2.  I am awaiting delivery of a Pair of JVC HA-SZ2000s to REALLY get the most out of this amp with that "bass-heavy" kind of music.  Then it will just blow their minds!  (I'm going to have to chain the JVCs down to prevent them from "growing legs" for when the kids want to "borrow them" to let their friends listen!) 
 
For anything else, The Koss PortaPros, VMODA BASS FREQs, or UE Super.Fi 3s work beautifully on the "LOW GAIN" setting.
 
Hopefully that gives you an idea of the breadth of musical application that the ASGARD 2s excel at.

My uncle has river otters in the stream that runs behind his house and those things are a trip...I use to take my oldest son (just a boy then) down to the dock and watch them for an hour or so every time we were there. I don't mean to overstate how good the A2 is as a headphone amp yet my honest opinion is IF it were priced higher it would be taken more seriously...which is a shame. 
 
It makes for a very sweet sounding preamp as well. I've always been a fan of passive preamps in the right setup yet the Asgard 2 replaced a very nice Creek OBH-22 as my office preamp as it sounds just as neutral/clean but has better dynamics. It's hard to beat a great sounding Class "A" headphone amp for IEM's and planar full-size can's plus a wonderful sounding preamp to boot, all for $250. I bet the otters would come around more often...or hang out longer.

I recently bought a Magni 2 Uber and whilst I was really impressed with it on the whole I found that with some tracks the treble/ upper mids (primarily cymbals and higher pitched guitars) became incredibly edgy and grating. 
 
It could of course have been something else in the chain so I'm not trying to imply that the M2U itself is edgy. I just found it that way with my gear.
 
My set up was PC->ODAC->M2U->Yamaha MT220 / FAD Pandora Hope VI. The MT220 was the worst offender (it does have some treble elevation) whereas the PH Hope VI is more balanced but was still problematic.  When swapping out the M2U for my O2 the tracks are far more tolerable.
 
I'm now contemplating buying an Asgard 2 (2nd time lucky) instead but not in a position to audition beforehand and worried I'll have a similar experience. Wondered if there was anyone here who has owned or spent time with both and experienced a similar thing with the M2U (or M2)? If so, how did you find the Asgard 2 by comparison?
 
Cheers for reading and thanks in advance for any help.

The quality or lack of quality of many recordings nowadays drives me crazy. You'll spend a small fortune (at least for me it is) on your home system and your portable setup and then you have to hope that the recording engineer/band knew what they were doing when they made the album/CD/music file you're listening to via said system. A great recording can make your entire system sound like it's been upgraded...a poorly made recording can leave you shaking your head. 
 
I haven't heard the Magni Uber 2, but I have found that the Asgard 2 (in two different systems) does a very nice job of passing along the signal feed to it without imparting much of its own signature. I think it's very neutral sounding. Obviously no product is perfect yet I haven't found a better headphone amp/preamp at or near the A2's price. Good luck!

Nice  I usually drive mine with a single-ended tube amp, but got curious as to how they might sound with a single-ended solid state. I got lucky and found myself a Pass "Return of Zen" power amplifier yesterday (single-ended, single stage, class A MOSFET amplifier, 2 x 10 W @ 8 Ohms). I could have bought a used Asgard 2 instead, but the Zen amp was cheaper and is more powerful. Can hardly believe how clear the sound from this thing is, considering its rather high distortion levels. The distortion only manifests itself as a slight tubelike warmth. It's also completely silent when no signal is present, it's quite impossible to tell through the headphones if it's on or off. I haven't tried the Asgard 2, but I think the Zen could be a good alternative for people who need more power. You have to build it yourself, though, or buy it from somone who did.

I received today my Asgard 2 and would like to point out a couple of things regarding what's been said at the beginning of this thread, and which had me kinda worried while I waited for delivery.
 
1) There is absolutely no discernible transformer hum at all, even with my ear against the chassis (this is the European 230 V version).
 
2) It's a class A amp. It does get warm. But it's been on and in use for the last 5 hours and it's definitely not "hot" by my standards, on the top and on the sides of the chassis. The bottom is definitely hotter though. But IMHO heat shouldn't really be a concern to anyone as I don't think you could ever actually burn yourself.
EDIT : surprisingly, it keeps getting slowly warmer and warmer even after 7 hours + of use. I wasn't expecting that and I must admit now that it's borderline hot overall, with a definite hot point on the right side near the front panel, if that is of any relevance to any one  I'm not concerned about it though as it's what it's supposed to do.
 
As for a proper sonic review, I will leave it to others since I don't have much experience (if at all) with HP amps, and like I said I have only used it during one afternoon. The only other HP amp I tried was a Fiio E12. I had it for a week and returned it as I found it harsh to listen to and there was a constant noise floor with sensitive HPs, regardless of volume knob position. On the other hand the Asgard 2 is silent unless the volume knob is turned fully clockwise (with no music playing), and it sounds just proper. Transparent, no obvious coloration. Just what I expect from an amp.
 
I must admit I bought it mainly for convenience reasons more than as an upgrade in SQ, as the HP out of my integrated home stereo amp (Yamaha AS-500) sounded already quite fine to me. However, the good surprise is that with the Asgard 2 the lows *definitely* hit lower and punchier. Almost scarily so on my V-Moda M-100, I might add. Due to the available power I guess. I learned here on head-fi that I'm a bass-head so I'm very satisfied with that ! 
 
It's very, very good sounding, but I can't really comment any further than that. It might sound more detailed overall, ie I seem to feel more into the music, I hear more of the recording room reverberation details, etc... but I'm not sure though, in all honesty it might as well be expectation bias. I'd have to do some proper ABX testing to tell any actual differences at this stage.
Anyway I'm very happy with it, it does what it's supposed to and it does it well 
 
And now the icing on the cake : it's even more gorgeous looking in real than in the pictures

EDIT: The following is of course not a fact but my subjective opinion, please treat it like that ;-)

The Asgard 2 will be fine for Momentum and 598 but for 600 and 650 there are better amps around....
Take a look at my current favorite the Gustard H10 or the Schiit Lyr2 I had them both for a week and liked the H10 a bit more but could happily live with the Lyr2 as well. I do have the Asgard (not the 2) and it can drive all these headphones well, the Asgard 2 is an improvement (especially the gain switch, would he handy for the Momentum). If you want one amp you can probably throw 95% of all headphone onto, the Lyr2 is it (or the H10)....
 
The Asgard2 though is no slouch, might be all you ever need as well. 
 
Cheers,
K
EDIT: oops typos...also just put down the HE-560 and am listening to the Momentum again - still love these headphones (and you will be excited to hear the HD598 and 650 (I don't have the HD600 so can't comment)....

Stan,
 
I agree with your statement. The biggest difference to the sound is surely the headphone. And I am totally with you in regards to the input switcher. Some "dramatic" difference I would have sworn I heard were gone once switching back and forth with an input switcher. Our human auditory memory sucks. Since that I always go with the expectation that there is no difference. Also - more expensive doesn't mean better sounding...and that is of course totally subjective. Just recently I compared two amps with a friend and he heard a way extended bottom end on one amp. To me - there was no difference. But he heard it and could identify the amps blind. I couldn't. 
 
And to be honest - with some headphones, changing the amp makes no meaningfull difference. Others do react more. I spend a week with the HE-560 and it sounded really great from every amp I had. Very little differences between amps. The HE-400 though - way larger differences depending on the amp...
 
Right now I am using the Momentum from a X5 & C5 combo - switching between the C5 and X5 directly there is a noticeable change in soundstage. Difference: the amp.
 
Cheers,
K
 
EDIT: also neutral is indeed neutral but which amp is really neutral?

Probably nothing you haven't heard before, but so that you have another actual user's account... (And since one of your contemplated headphone models is the HD-650 which I use with my ASGARD 2.)
I am extremely pleased with my ASGARD 2 for a number of reasons:
- Has NEVER failed, been "quirky", needed special attention, or periodic reboots or maintenance. - It just RUNS.
- Great sound out of my HD-650s, (Most challenging headphones I have in terms of power consumption to drive and getting excellent sound from any source.). I have 5 legitimate amps (as opposed to just player sources.). And they sound the best on my ASGARD 2. (Surprisingly, they sound almost as good on my iFi IDSD Micro which is a portable of all things!)
- I leave mine on 24/7 unless we are going away. It has never over-heated in the summer, and unless I'm driving the HD-650s, it doesn't get THAT hot.
- Excellent build quality. If this fell off the shelf onto a tile floor, I'd be more concerned that it would destroy the tiles it fell on than if it was damaged itself. I'm not eager to put it to the test, but I feel very comfortable that the all-metal construction would outlast partially-plastic units. (The LCD is the only thing I see on it that ISNT metal!)
Considerations: it is a TRUE amp, and gets warm. No active fans to fail, just plain airflow, so make sure you place it where air can circulate. I'd avoid placing it on soft plastic shelving like what you might find in IKEA or department stores. I have mine on a tempered glass shelf and it looks awesome.
Other headphones I connect to my ASGARD 2 on a regular basis: JVC HA M55x (2 "his & hers" sets), JVC HA-SZ2000s. (The SZ-2000s are AWESOME with EDM, Club, Electronica, or any other bass-heavy music. These are BASS MONSTERS that feel like you are listening to a club's Heavy-duty speakers.) RS-180s. (Amped to the RS-180's own transmitter, so not getting the full benefit, but still nice.). KOSS Porta-Pros. Yes, I said Porta-Pros! They sound great out of almost anything. And for iems, I use VMODA bass Freqs or Super-Fi 3s with it sometimes when doing comparisons, but not often because of the short cord length. When the ASGARD 2 is on LOW gain, I get a fairly clean noise floor. But no, I wouldn't recommend this as a primary amp for sensitive iems.
Thee you have it. I strongly recommend the ASGARD 2 if you want to get into higher-end listening but want to spend less than $1,000 on a GOOD headphone amp. I'm sure there is better out there for more money, and maybe even in the same price range, but I haven't heard them yet....
Good luck, and enjoy!

It looks like you would need a simple mini-jack to RCA cable, (Though I am sure that some here will be able to recommend a brand or two.) to connect the Hegel to the ASGARD 2 as it is RCA-In only I believe.  I'd verify the levels, and see if I could set the Hegel to full volume and then regulate the listening volume with the POT on the ASGARD 2 so that you are not losing any digital bits that might get shaved-off by using less than full volume at the Hegel stage of your audio chain.
 
I enjoy both my FIIO e17 and my iFi iDSD Micro with my ASGARD 2 when I use either unit as DAC-only devices amped by my ASGARD 2.  In my opinion, the iDSD Micro outdoes the FIIO e17 in terms of definition, tightness of bass, and clarity. 
 
Your mileage may vary.
 
Congratulations on your soon-to-be "new arrival"!  :-)

I've never found the Asgard 2 to sound "dark" with any headphone I've used with it. In fact, I find it to be extremely clean/neutral sounding. The A2 also makes a wonderful single source preamp and the High/Low gain switch makes it easy to achieve the right amount of voltage output for your powered speakers or stereo speaker amp. In my office system, I use the A2 as a headphone amp/preamp to my Parasound Halo A23 speaker amp. The pair work wonderful together and it's difficult to find true "Class A" preamp/headphone amp for only $250.
 
I've never heard the HD800's, but I have read that "some" find that it can sound a tad too bright with solid state amps. If you do a search here for the "best type of amp for the HD800's" you'll see some owners say that the HD800's can sound "too bright & analytical" (not my words) and that you're better off driving it with a tube amp. That may or may not be true, but that has zero to do with the quality of the Asgard 2, simply that it doesn't sound like a tube amp. If you're looking to drive the HD800's I would do a search here for amps that work best with those headphones, it's possible that a tube amp would serve you better with those headphones.
 
Good luck with whatever you decide!

I believe that the past few posts reflect my opinon as well.
 
Speaking only for myself, I have never found a tendency for my ASGARD 2 to ever be anything but neutral.
 
I have 3 amplifiers I use primarily:
 
FIIO e17, iFi iDSD Micro, & ASGARD 2.  Each more powerful than the last.  Each with a unique sound.
 
Then based on my headphones, each provides me with what I seek, but in general I enjoy each one for any application.
 
Reference analytic / bright side - AKG K550 & K545
 
Warm with good detail - Sennheiser HD-650 & RS-180 has its own amp in the wireless base
 
"General purpose" - Koss Porta-Pros (Under-rated/under-appreciated headphones in my opinion)
 
BASS HEAD - JVC HA-m55x (General purpose thump) & HA-SZ2000 (EQ & Bass boost for ultimate bone-rattling bass)
 
All three amps handle most equally-well, but differently with few exceptions. (FIIO e17's power doesn't really satisfy with HD-650s, and isn't as capable as the other 2 when in basshead mode, but is the ONLY "pants-pocketable" amp solution for travel.
 
90% of the time my setup is HTPC --> iFi iDSD Micro (DAC) --> Schiit ASGARD 2  With either HD-650 or K550 attached depending on genre and source type/quality.
 
Anyone feel differently?  I'm always on the lookout for new ways to try things.
 
Cheers!

I just got 2 AKG headphones that I'm loving with my ASGRD 2. The K550 is a bright and analytical headphone to me. Not quite as analytical as the Grado 225e was, but also not as harsh in the treble as the 225e was either. Now for REFERENCE, it is great. But if you want a bit more in the bass section, the K545 is almost as wide of soundstage, but brings more to the bottom end. By NO means bass-biased, but nicely fully on the bottom end. The only drawback is that the K545 is a MOBILE headphone, so the cord is quite a bit shorter than the one on the K550. (So I just move my seat closer). Both sound glorious with the ASGARD 2. They come in second to my HD-650s, but have the added advantage of being nicely-driven by my DX90 DAP where the HD-650s definitely need an external amp with more power. They sound pretty good straight from my iPhone 4S, 5, & iPad Airs, as well!
I was able to get my K545 for less than $125, and the K550 for less than $112 from AMAZON warehouse deals and ithe K550 arrived factory-direct from AKG, the K545 from factory refurb, but no retail box. (The box matters to me for $400-plus dollar headphones, but I'm not worried about it for these...)
To be honest, my HD-650s are still my favorites for "slow" music like orchestral/classical/dramatic soundtracks, but the AKGs are now my go-tos for pop, rock, or anything that has a fast pace to it.Edited by knorris908 - 6/2/15 at 5:20pm

Just bought the Asgard 2 & very satisfied with it.
Very nice bump in sound quality from what i been hearing so far.

I do have a few questions:How how is too hot? How long should it be turned on?
 
I don't want the insides short circuiting.
 
Also, is there a proper order to power off the switch, unplug the headphone & the power adapter?
I heard doing some out of order can lessen the lifespan.
 
 
Lastly is the lo & hi gain switch on the back, it's there for high impedance headphones & low impedance, but I selected the hi option on a low 32ohms headphone & it sounded better & louder than on lo.
Is setting it on 'hi" the best option for most headphones for the best sound?
 
My headphones so far are:
-Sennheiser HD600
-Philips Fidelio X1
-Audio Technica ATH-M50
-Audio Technica AD700
 
I'm guessing none of them need the 'lo' setting?

I asked Nick from schiit about the heat. He, and as Jason did before, mentioned that it's normal and wouldn't cause harm to any component inside. He said you can leave it on indefinitely if you wish, though I prefer to turn it on once in the morning and leave it on all day, turning it off before bed. Whatever floats your boat.
There's really no correct way to pull out your headphones and powering it down, as schiit has installed a muting relay to ensure that nothing shorts out. Some people might say amp on first then inserting headphones (and headphones out first, then turning off), but it shouldn't matter.
Regarding hi and lo gain, I use high gain for my power hungry planars (low efficiency headphones under 100 dB) and low gain for my dynamic headphones (efficiency over 100 dB). I find a slight audible hiss on my AKG K550 with the high gain, which disappears with low gain.
Enjoy your new Asgard 2! You'll love it.

Thanks theblueprint, nice to know my equipment is safe over prolonged use.
 
On another note, everybody says these have more than enough power to drive the Sennheiser HD600, but when I plugged them in to the amp, they had a very mid level sound. I plugged in the cheaper Philips Fidelio X1 headphones & the volume coming from them was literally twice as loud.
 
I'm not complaining about sound signature, just loudness. With the X1, I feel I'm getting my money's worth with the amp.  With the HD600, I feel the sound is definitely better than it is without an amp, but not the huge groundbreaking sound I was expecting. Especially not like I'm getting with the X1.
 
Is that because it is 300ohms & theoretically amps with more power than A2 = more power to the headphones & louder sound for the HD600?
