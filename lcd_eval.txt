Not many headphones are going to get anywhere near the HD800 for soundstage. It is the soundstage king. The LCD-3 was never going to compete with that. Totally different headphone aimed at a different market.
 
It sounds to me like you are a detail person and that is great however LCD-3 will never satisfy you. I think there is two types of listeners. Detail and lush. I for instance go for lush. I have a warm DAC. Tube amp with lush warm tubes and the LCD-3. Detail followers will hate it. See not everyone looks for detail. I know I will be losing detail and it doesn't worry me one bit. I like the treble to be there and importantly be rendered sweetly. A nice mid-range push and clean bass. Something I can listen to all day and never gets harsh.
 
If you are after detail and soundstage I think the LCD-X will be better suited. Being into detail you have plenty of options. There is not a lot of options for us lush guys.
 
On the flip side I have listened to the HD800's many many times. They are everywhere. Every time I listen I can't get them off fast enough. Really can only tolerate them for 30 seconds or so.
 
Nobody is correct. Just different.
