Not many headphones are going to get anywhere near the HD800 for soundstage. It is the soundstage king. The LCD-3 was never going to compete with that. Totally different headphone aimed at a different market.
 
It sounds to me like you are a detail person and that is great however LCD-3 will never satisfy you. I think there is two types of listeners. Detail and lush. I for instance go for lush. I have a warm DAC. Tube amp with lush warm tubes and the LCD-3. Detail followers will hate it. See not everyone looks for detail. I know I will be losing detail and it doesn't worry me one bit. I like the treble to be there and importantly be rendered sweetly. A nice mid-range push and clean bass. Something I can listen to all day and never gets harsh.
 
If you are after detail and soundstage I think the LCD-X will be better suited. Being into detail you have plenty of options. There is not a lot of options for us lush guys.
 
On the flip side I have listened to the HD800's many many times. They are everywhere. Every time I listen I can't get them off fast enough. Really can only tolerate them for 30 seconds or so.
 
Nobody is correct. Just different.

Of course the HD800s soundstage is much bigger.  But on the 650 $%# NO.  The 650 sounds like a total mess.  The 600s are better IMO, however both don't compare the the LCD-3F.  
 
If you say your getting globs of micro details out the 650 the your impressions are questionable to me.  
 
I'm not sure what your setup is.  But the LCD-3F is a high end TOTL headphone, it shout be treated as such.  Because of it's warm presentation a traditional tube amp may not be the best to go with it.  A lean tube amp like the EC 445 is a great match for these headphones.  
 
I owned the LCD-3C and these are a level above in the clarity department, more air and a more spacious soundstage - compared to the older 3C.  
 
These headphones may not be for you.  But to say the 650s retrieve more detail is just not the case.

For Ed10 I am using AK240 as source playing hi-res files. I use Pro-ject RS DAC, preamp and head amp. All tubes.
Also have good results just using the AK240 connected to CI Audio head amp by AK Crystal cable and cutting the mid treble one notch on the AK eq.
Interestingly I have had the E10 for four years and the SQ is still changing, smoothing out and becoming softer at the top. I have read that the more recent E5 is still settling in after 18 months.
As for the Audeze by "roles reversed" I meant that it needs a bright DAC/amp combination to give it some treble life otherwise to my ears it sounds slightly muffled and dead: very accurate, forgiving of lesser quality files, which the E10 certainly is not, but too plush and lacking in punch. I usually listen to classical music.
All very subjective, but that is my humble opinion.

Hi,
I hope I wont interrupt the flow of the thread, but I would like to raise a kind of technical question regarding my LCDs.
 
I have an audio track (Preludium from 2014 reissue of album Theli by Therion) where there come audio distortions from the left headphone since around 2/3 of the track till the end.
I can think of two options: either there is something wrong with the track, or there is something wrong with the left headphone itself. To decide which hypothesis is true I decided to simply swap audio channels and viola! When the right headphone plays left channel, no audio distortions come out of it. So my conclusion is that I encountered a defect in the left headphone itself.
 
I thus decided to RMA LCD-3 with my local re-seller and loaned from him LCD-2 in return for not insisting that RMA process must be completed in 30 days (we are from Europe). But there comes another twist to the story: borrowed LCD-2 exhibits the same behavior. Left headphone cannot handle the track without distortions, but when I swap channels, right headphone again handles left channel without problems. And now, to top things off, the re-seller called me that after some testing on his audio setup, both the left and the right headphone produces audio distortions. So his conclusion is that there is something wrong with the audio track itself.
 
So at this point, if possible, I'd like to ask the community for a feedback.
Could either me or the re-seller be just "hearing" things?
Could the testing difference be attributed to that the re-seller's setup is single-ended, while mine is balanced?
 
And finally, would somebody be willing or interested to test the track on his or hers LCDs (or any other headphones for that matter)?
If so, below are links to the track in two lossless formats (both files are 10 MB; audio distortions are from 1:05 onward).
FLAC: http://www.filedropper.com/01-preludium
ALAC (in m4a container): http://www.filedropper.com/01-preludium_1
 
Thanks in advance,
 
     Martin
 
P.S. At this point, I have no doubt that the left headphone would produce the audio distortion, but I am currently at a loss as to what to make of the fact that upon channel swap (either SW or by physical exchange of CNC connectors), right headphone plays the left channel just fine on my setup (and I even tried disconnecting the left headphone entirely so that I eventually don't project the distortion just to it as was a suspicion of the re-seller).

So I've been comparing my recently acquired LCD-3fs (build date 5-15-15) to my well broken in Hifiman HE-560s for the past several hours using Tidal HiFi streaming via my Centrance HiFi M8 portable amp.
I gotta tell ya, I am not sure which phone I like best. The LCD 3 is more efficient for sure but the Centrance has no trouble driving either phone. Level matching was a challenge.
As for the bass,I expected it to blow the Hifiman out of the water but it turns out that the Hifiman not only digs just as deep(if not deeper) but also has more air around the bass notes. The bass on the LCD is more rounded off and fuller with more mid bass presence. Big surprise there.
Next is the midrange. It's more intimate on the LCD 3s and a bit more forward. They both sound great in this area, but I do understand why people love ithat LCD midrange. It is
creamy for lack of another word.
Next is the treble. Hifiman all the way. More extended and open without being edgy or harsh. The LCDs treble sounds fine until you switch to the Hifiman.
So it goes without saying that the Hifiman comes across as being more neutral and accurate. The Audeze don't try to hide the fact that they have more of a house sound. That house
sound is nice and everything sounds larger but I don't think at this point in time that it's preferable to the more open ,neutral sound of the Hifiman. Both get your toes tapping and that of course matters most to me.
Finally the weight difference is huge. But much to my surprise, the extra weight of the LCDs doesn't bother me one bit. They fit snug and secure and I think this helps offset its weight.
There you have it, my 3 hour assessment comparing these two phones. I will update after more extended listening if anything changes.Edited by Hifi59 - 6/11/15 at 4:54pm

Im Currently using the Brown leather ones (my LCD3's are about 9 months old) and have just got a pair of the Micro suede ones (same as yours i think) just to see if there is any difference between the 2 in regards to sound and comfort. I believe Audeze has encounter a lot of feedback regarding the fazored models and the Leather pads as with my right earcup the fazor touched my ear.

They are shipping out some small foam spacer pads which slide inside the pads with out the need to remove the pads at all (will post some pictures) resolved the issue for me but also made the leather a bit more stiffer than the softness they normally have.
 
I figure once i take them off i can try both and see which ones i prefer the most and also check out the quality inside the cups. Will take lots of photos and post later for you guys =)

Which pads did you go for?
 
I just had some new microfiber ones arrive and they look a lot slimmer than my leather ones Havent measured but will do, Its been a long road for me as i had an issue with one fazor touching my ear and not sitting straight. Tried to tell them it was a frame issue but they wanted to try pads first so (1 week waiting for foam spacers) still have the issue, then they sent me some new pads (another week waiting) still didn't fix the issue as the pads look a lot thinner. After a lot more emails they are finally sending me a new frame as its bent (the C shaped part that goes around the wooden cup). 
 
There is a guide on Audezes website for changing the pads. https://www.audeze.com/padschange Its really straight forward although some people have issues with the leather ripping off but another member suggested a smooth butter knife and slowly peel them off helps to reduce this.
 
Will post a photo comparison of the 2 pads for you guys tonight.

I posted the following in the "How many times have your LCD3 been returned to Audeze for servicing (RMA)" thread,   though I think it is appropriate to post as well in the LCD3 threads as a tale of caution.
 
.................................................................................................................................................................
 
Sweetmeat ... I like your idea of a poll ... I assume it was to obtain a better perspective on how bad the LCD3 failure rate is ... or if it being put out of proportion.
 
For trying to gain some perspective, I commend you.
 
Though I do find one issue with your poll that if you could kindly update if possible ... the highest choice is 3 times or more ... well, I am on driver failure number 5 
in the last 2.5 years of being a LCD-3 owner.   The first 4 failures were with the LCD-3C, it was replaced with a LCD-3F which just failed, making a total of 5 failures.
 
My first LCD-3C experienced 4 driver failures (a mix of left and right) .... so the average ... Audeze Mean Time Between Failure (AMTBF) for drivers is 6.5 months.
Also had a SE cable failure ... which was replaced with a cable which was dead on arrival. So 2 faulty cables.
A total of 6 issues or incidents in 2 years for the LCD-3C.  
The wood box is also poor quality ... when I opened my LCD-3 for the very first time , the hinge on the wood box broke.
I should have taken that as an omen of things to come,  though I am not counting that as an incident, do not want to appear picky.
 
I also find the Quality Control of Audeze very poor when performing repairs.
Remember sending it in for a Right Driver failure .... and it came back with a loose Left XLR connector, about 5mm movement away from the Left earcup.
So Audeze fix the Right side of my HP ... and it comes back with damage to the Left side ???
 
 
In December 2014 this was replaced with a new LCD-3F (came from my dealer) which just tonight experienced a failed Left Driver ... only 6.5 months old
... so the 6.5 months Audeze Mean Time Between Failure is consistent.
So, tonight, at the 2.5 year mark ... I am on issue number 7, driver failure number 5 for being an LCD-3 owner
 
 
The first 4 driver failures were with the LCD-3C ... the latest driver failure is with the LCD-3F ... making a total of of 5 Driver failures while having a LCD-3.
 
 
I had hoped that the driver failure issues was mainly for the LCD-3C ... though apparently it is still evident with the LCD-3F.
Had hoped it was a manufacturing issue which was resolved in the first year (or two) ... though newer LCD-3F still experience a high failure rate, which is disgraceful.
 
 
I have never had any HP, Speaker, fail .... ever.
DAC's or AMPs ... never.
Some electronics are more than 10 years old and they never fail like Audeze ... actually tonight I had to switch back to AKG-701's that I purchased early 2005 (?).
 
I treat my gear with respect, listen at low to moderate volumes.
Do not use the LCD-3 for travel.
Used with appropriate sized powered amps ... 1 or 2 Watt.
This is a reference piece of equipment, so it is in my own best interest to treat it with respect, which I do ... still it continually breaks down.
 
It is not just the disappointment of a product that is so unreliable when it breaks down , it also the continued escalating costs of shipping & insurance for a product which as far as reliability goes is .... shameful.
 
My average uptime ... that is when I have the LCD-3 at home (when it is not travelling around the world continually being repaired) is just .... 80%.
 
I think I have a fairly high tolerance and even up to incident number 6 I was still considering getting an Audeze LCD-X as I find the Audeze sound quality simply outstanding.
Also really find Audeze extremely comfortable.
 
Though, this last incident (number 7), which is driver failure number 5 has me rethinking that thought of buying anymore Audeze (like the LCD-X) very strongly ... I have had enough.
 
While I do strongly love both the comfort & sound quality of the LCD-3 ...as far as Audeze reliability is concerned, the best word for it is ..... shameful.   
 
I am disgusted.

+1
 
Badas, Mikoss, Sweemeat, mine ... all our opinions are equally valuable.  
HeadFi is only a great community because of each of the individuals who spend there time contributing.
Some post more, some less.
 
Moving on ...
 
Interesting to hear that the NZ distributor dropped the Audeze line.   I wonder why that was ?
 
I know that I am making a number of posts because, well, driver failure number 5, kind of broke the camels back ... I do not wish any ill will towards Audeze ... actually the complete opposite, that is, I wish them every success, I want them to grow, strength by strength.    As I keep repeating my love of the Audeze sound quality (just trying to keep a balanced viewpoint in spite of the latest Audeze LCD3 driver failure),  I just wish they could provide a LCD3 driver that is reliable,  not disgraceful.
 
I was going to pickup the LCD-X later this year,  though with the latest failure, I am re-assessing and now looking at other manufacturers.
