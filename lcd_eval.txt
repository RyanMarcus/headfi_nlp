Not many headphones are going to get anywhere near the HD800 for soundstage. It is the soundstage king. The LCD-3 was never going to compete with that. Totally different headphone aimed at a different market.
 
It sounds to me like you are a detail person and that is great however LCD-3 will never satisfy you. I think there is two types of listeners. Detail and lush. I for instance go for lush. I have a warm DAC. Tube amp with lush warm tubes and the LCD-3. Detail followers will hate it. See not everyone looks for detail. I know I will be losing detail and it doesn't worry me one bit. I like the treble to be there and importantly be rendered sweetly. A nice mid-range push and clean bass. Something I can listen to all day and never gets harsh.
 
If you are after detail and soundstage I think the LCD-X will be better suited. Being into detail you have plenty of options. There is not a lot of options for us lush guys.
 
On the flip side I have listened to the HD800's many many times. They are everywhere. Every time I listen I can't get them off fast enough. Really can only tolerate them for 30 seconds or so.
 
Nobody is correct. Just different.

So I've been comparing my recently acquired LCD-3fs (build date 5-15-15) to my well broken in Hifiman HE-560s for the past several hours using Tidal HiFi streaming via my Centrance HiFi M8 portable amp.
I gotta tell ya, I am not sure which phone I like best. The LCD 3 is more efficient for sure but the Centrance has no trouble driving either phone. Level matching was a challenge.
As for the bass,I expected it to blow the Hifiman out of the water but it turns out that the Hifiman not only digs just as deep(if not deeper) but also has more air around the bass notes. The bass on the LCD is more rounded off and fuller with more mid bass presence. Big surprise there.
Next is the midrange. It's more intimate on the LCD 3s and a bit more forward. They both sound great in this area, but I do understand why people love ithat LCD midrange. It is
creamy for lack of another word.
Next is the treble. Hifiman all the way. More extended and open without being edgy or harsh. The LCDs treble sounds fine until you switch to the Hifiman.
So it goes without saying that the Hifiman comes across as being more neutral and accurate. The Audeze don't try to hide the fact that they have more of a house sound. That house
sound is nice and everything sounds larger but I don't think at this point in time that it's preferable to the more open ,neutral sound of the Hifiman. Both get your toes tapping and that of course matters most to me.
Finally the weight difference is huge. But much to my surprise, the extra weight of the LCDs doesn't bother me one bit. They fit snug and secure and I think this helps offset its weight.
There you have it, my 3 hour assessment comparing these two phones. I will update after more extended listening if anything changes.

Received my pair yesterday, first thing I did was put the velours on.  I also noticed I have the transparent color (rev. 4 aka 2 I guess)  Listened to the HE-400 for 11 hours yesterday straight through except for an hour dinner break.  These things are much more comfortable compared to the Audeze, I only wish the earcups could be a little bigger.
 
Here are some thoughts from the first day of owning them:  I don't feel I'm missing anything in the bass, if anything it feels a little faster and tighter than the Audeze to me.  The mids on the Audeze are the best I've ever heard, however the HE-400 is no slouch here.  I listen to mostly female vocals and they sound really good.  I'm enjoying the HE-400 treble much more than the LCD-2's, I'm picking up sounds I've never heard before on any headphone I've owned... nice!  Soundstage is also great on the HE-400, it's much more open sounding than the LCD-2 more like the HD650 in this regard.  The Audeze sounds like I'm listening in a narrow hallway while the HE-400 sounds like i'm in a open room.
 
Really enjoying these much more than I thought I would.  For the price the HE-400 are an absolute steal.

I received today my Asgard 2 and would like to point out a couple of things regarding what's been said at the beginning of this thread, and which had me kinda worried while I waited for delivery.
 
1) There is absolutely no discernible transformer hum at all, even with my ear against the chassis (this is the European 230 V version).
 
2) It's a class A amp. It does get warm. But it's been on and in use for the last 5 hours and it's definitely not "hot" by my standards, on the top and on the sides of the chassis. The bottom is definitely hotter though. But IMHO heat shouldn't really be a concern to anyone as I don't think you could ever actually burn yourself.
EDIT : surprisingly, it keeps getting slowly warmer and warmer even after 7 hours + of use. I wasn't expecting that and I must admit now that it's borderline hot overall, with a definite hot point on the right side near the front panel, if that is of any relevance to any one  I'm not concerned about it though as it's what it's supposed to do.
 
As for a proper sonic review, I will leave it to others since I don't have much experience (if at all) with HP amps, and like I said I have only used it during one afternoon. The only other HP amp I tried was a Fiio E12. I had it for a week and returned it as I found it harsh to listen to and there was a constant noise floor with sensitive HPs, regardless of volume knob position. On the other hand the Asgard 2 is silent unless the volume knob is turned fully clockwise (with no music playing), and it sounds just proper. Transparent, no obvious coloration. Just what I expect from an amp.
 
I must admit I bought it mainly for convenience reasons more than as an upgrade in SQ, as the HP out of my integrated home stereo amp (Yamaha AS-500) sounded already quite fine to me. However, the good surprise is that with the Asgard 2 the lows *definitely* hit lower and punchier. Almost scarily so on my V-Moda M-100, I might add. Due to the available power I guess. I learned here on head-fi that I'm a bass-head so I'm very satisfied with that ! 
 
It's very, very good sounding, but I can't really comment any further than that. It might sound more detailed overall, ie I seem to feel more into the music, I hear more of the recording room reverberation details, etc... but I'm not sure though, in all honesty it might as well be expectation bias. I'd have to do some proper ABX testing to tell any actual differences at this stage.
Anyway I'm very happy with it, it does what it's supposed to and it does it well 
 
And now the icing on the cake : it's even more gorgeous looking in real than in the pictures
