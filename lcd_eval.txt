Not many headphones are going to get anywhere near the HD800 for soundstage. It is the soundstage king. The LCD-3 was never going to compete with that. Totally different headphone aimed at a different market.
 
It sounds to me like you are a detail person and that is great however LCD-3 will never satisfy you. I think there is two types of listeners. Detail and lush. I for instance go for lush. I have a warm DAC. Tube amp with lush warm tubes and the LCD-3. Detail followers will hate it. See not everyone looks for detail. I know I will be losing detail and it doesn't worry me one bit. I like the treble to be there and importantly be rendered sweetly. A nice mid-range push and clean bass. Something I can listen to all day and never gets harsh.
 
If you are after detail and soundstage I think the LCD-X will be better suited. Being into detail you have plenty of options. There is not a lot of options for us lush guys.
 
On the flip side I have listened to the HD800's many many times. They are everywhere. Every time I listen I can't get them off fast enough. Really can only tolerate them for 30 seconds or so.
 
Nobody is correct. Just different.

So I've been comparing my recently acquired LCD-3fs (build date 5-15-15) to my well broken in Hifiman HE-560s for the past several hours using Tidal HiFi streaming via my Centrance HiFi M8 portable amp.
I gotta tell ya, I am not sure which phone I like best. The LCD 3 is more efficient for sure but the Centrance has no trouble driving either phone. Level matching was a challenge.
As for the bass,I expected it to blow the Hifiman out of the water but it turns out that the Hifiman not only digs just as deep(if not deeper) but also has more air around the bass notes. The bass on the LCD is more rounded off and fuller with more mid bass presence. Big surprise there.
Next is the midrange. It's more intimate on the LCD 3s and a bit more forward. They both sound great in this area, but I do understand why people love ithat LCD midrange. It is
creamy for lack of another word.
Next is the treble. Hifiman all the way. More extended and open without being edgy or harsh. The LCDs treble sounds fine until you switch to the Hifiman.
So it goes without saying that the Hifiman comes across as being more neutral and accurate. The Audeze don't try to hide the fact that they have more of a house sound. That house
sound is nice and everything sounds larger but I don't think at this point in time that it's preferable to the more open ,neutral sound of the Hifiman. Both get your toes tapping and that of course matters most to me.
Finally the weight difference is huge. But much to my surprise, the extra weight of the LCDs doesn't bother me one bit. They fit snug and secure and I think this helps offset its weight.
There you have it, my 3 hour assessment comparing these two phones. I will update after more extended listening if anything changes.
