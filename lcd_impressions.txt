Hi Peter
 
I always like your review and Skylabs review and Curawong
 
I have now my //MARK\\lCD //MARK\\3 also since 2 weeks , below is my personal impression :
 
After one weeks of marathon hearing from //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 , at the end i bought my //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 for my Headphone Collection.
//MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 is the best natural Headphone i ever heard to date.

My Headphpone Collection are : //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 , //MARK\\T //MARK\\1 ,//MARK\\ED //MARK\\8 //MARK\\Ruthenium , //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2 //MARK\\rev //MARK\\2 , //MARK\\ATH //MARK\\WQ //MARK\\1000 //MARK\\X , //MARK\\HD //MARK\\650

My Souce are : Imac 27" with WAV File Music

CD Player April Music Stello CDA 500

DAC : Stello CDA 500 as stand alone DAC

Cable : RCA Cable ACR Reference Silver Cable 
           USB Cable ACR Reference II 

Head Amp : Pre Amp from T + A P 10 - 2 from Germany
 
                  Website from T + A Pre Amp P 10 - 2  : taelektroakustik.de

Music genre : Jazz, Audiophile , Blues , Slow Rock , Classical Music.

High : more open anbd detail compare to my //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2 //MARK\\rev //MARK\\2

Mid : more sweet and natural compare to my //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2 //MARK\\Rev //MARK\\2

Bass : the Bass Quantity //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2 //MARK\\rev //MARK\\2 more than my //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 , but the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 Bass Quality is better and deeper Bass and more Detail.

Separation : much better than my CD 2 Rev 2 , i can hear the instrumental placement better than my //MARK\\lCD //MARK\\2 //MARK\\Rev //MARK\\2

Sound Staging : wide and very good in Depth Layering compare to my //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2 //MARK\\Rev //MARK\\2.

                         only my //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 is more wider sound stage than my //MARK\\lCD //MARK\\3.

Conculsion : //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 is the best Headphone in my Collection, is very natural sounding Headphone.

                   If your Source and Amp very bad , your //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 become very bad Sound Quality.

                   Now with my set up above , in my personal opinion is the best set up for //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3.

I bought my first //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 early January 2012 , from the first badge came to my Local Dealer ( Totally was 4 sets //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 )
 
My //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 sound quality was the best from all 4 sets //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 , 2 month a go my friend send his veild //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 to RMA to Audeze USA , after he got his //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 back. the Sound Quality mine still
 
better than his RMA , his RMA unit with new driver was not in perfect , because his right chanel got Problem and he complain to Audeze Distro in Singapore.
 
This time he got brand new replacement from Audeze Distro in Singapore.
 
Bravo Audeze for their best customer service 
 
After he got the brand new replacement //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 , we do audition again mine .
 
This time my //MARK\\LCD sound so muffeled compare his brand new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 , at the end i decided to sell mine and bought again //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 and today just received it. , the same serien number like his //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3   
 
Our two //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 Sound Quality now is different and more open and enjoy compare to our //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 January 2012 badge 
 
Source : CD Player Stello CDA 500
 
DAC : Eximus Dp 1
 
Headamp : Eximus Dp1
 
Cable : standard //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 cable and Moon Audio Silver Dragon v 3
 
High : more open and extended compare to ours january 2012 LCD 3
         we heard the same song from Dee Dee Brightwater : Angel Eyes
         I can heard more cymbals come out from my new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3  
 
MId : more clear and clean compare my //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 January 2012
 
Bass : more detail and full body and tight and very good and deep impact.
 
Separation : my new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 has better separatioon , i can hear better the instrument placement from the Orchestra.
 
Soundstage : is same like my January //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3  , the Depth is better now , maybe my new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 more detail and more black background that i can hear more than before
 
Conculsion : after a lot of Critics from Audeze Fans , Audeze got very good goal in new badge //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3
 
                   from this afternoon i never stop to hear my new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 , i listen my music more enjoy now with my Brand New //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 than before compare with my January //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 
 
                   From open the Box the Sound Quality much better than my January //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3
 
                   I feel the new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 more easy to drive compare my January //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3
 
                   My new //MARK\\LCD 3 is the best from all my Ortho and Dynamic Driver i ever heard and own
 
This is my personal impression for my just one day new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3

Maybe the more recent RMA'd batch hasn't been having the driver cut-out issues, but my early RMA'd unit (sent back in March to get the dampening/ear pad revisions) worked great until last month, when I came back from a month away on vacation to find that first one driver, then both, had failed.  My apartment was kept at normal temperatures and there weren't any other issues I'm aware of that would cause the drivers to fail.
 
Well, now I have a double RMA'd unit, and so far no issues.  Audeze was very prompt with their responses and turned mine around the same day.  I just hope that the QC has reached the point where they can safely turn these around that quickly and not have widespread problems down the line.
 
As long as my set still plays music, it sounds pretty freakin' awesome with the Liquid Fire and PWD MKII DAC.  It's hard to imagine (as many people seem to say) that this is a more forgiving headphone than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.//MARK\\2 or //MARK\\HD800, because there is a lot of music that just sounds so grainy and compressed on my setup as to be unlistenable.  If that's the case, then I'd hate to hear how that music sounds on those other headphones.  But well-recorded stuff has been mind-blowing.

Thanks for posting the link to the review...
One thing I found interesting and the other is a concern.
Interesting: they rated the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s an 8.5 for comfort and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s a 9.0. This incremental difference seems appropriate given what I know about the differences between them. It is the absolute ratings that I find curious. Given the weight, clamping force, uneven pressure and hot wear temperature of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s, I would rate them as a 5-6 for comfort (for example, I would rate my AKGs as 7 and //MARK\\HD800 as a 9-10 for example). My expectation would be the the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 would also be a 6-7 in comfort based on the ear pads. It shows that different people's heads and sensibilities regarding comfort are all over the map.
Concerned: while I am happy to see a positive review for a small, entrepreneurial, US based company; I am concerned about the consequences to quality, availability and service that this could ensue based on increased demand from such a glowing review. Small companies going through rapid growth will face these types of challenges. Audez'e has already experience some development/quality challenges which they appear to be handling well, but if demand steps up, new challenges of a different type may present itself. This however is a happier problem than the alternative. Additionally, the market for $2,000 HF iin itself is a self limiting reaction.

No, they are still what I would consider to be a start-up company from a product design and manufacturing perspective.
The concept that I presented has more to do with what happens to low production items when demand drives volumes up. You encounter more input variability on materials that you never experienced before, you at first duplicate processes to keep up with demand later changing a design and processes to keep up with demand.these all can add up to product quality issues.
This isn't a small company vs. large company issue as you rightly pointed out. Poor quality can come from either. As I said in my earlier post, while demand may tick up from a positive review there is a finite market for HF priced as high as the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. Which in a sense is good news. Honestly, this is a purely hypothetical concern. Over my 30 years in the business of developing products however it happens often.

No, a start up is well...starting up. They've been making the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s in pretty good volume for a few years (more than 2). I wouldn't qualify them on your terminology by any means. They've produced products that in my (and many other people's opinions....see my first post in this thread) that surpass many of the old guard companies' products. I've worked in high end electronics manufacturing for over 15 years (in successive engineering roles) and successfully implemented ISO9001 and AS9100 quality standards and I'm very aware of the points you raise, but a start up is just that....a company that's starting up. Audeze is beyond this stage as they've been producing high end headphones in reasonably good volumes for a few years already and as a result, I would not qualify them that way anymore. Did they have problems in the past? Sure...but so has Stax with the //MARK\\SR009 and blown driver issue when they were first released, Grado has the Grattle issue, etc...

I primarily listen to dubstep flavors of music; but I also listen to artist such as Adele, Alison Krauss, Norah Jones, Radiohead, Hurt, Alice in Chains, etc.
 
But 80% of my listening is dubstep.  The main concern for me with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s and even the 3s is comfort.  On occassion, I find the sweet spot and the head phones don't bother me that much at all, but usually I find myself adjusting them to remain comfortable...
 
It's the main reason I use my //MARK\\Mad //MARK\\Dogs - 85% of the sound, but 10x the comfort.
 
I did enjoy the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500s, but I did not enjoy the //MARK\\T1s (aside from the comfort).  I'm not sure if that helps in determining which option would be best for me (and yeah, I know only I can ultimately decide that, but I'm looking for input from others who have experienced the same setups).
 
I do find myself very intrigued by the sound stage of the //MARK\\HD-//MARK\\800 and the comfort level.  I can get them for around 1k brand new, which is the same cost of upgrading to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 for me.

I have had the //MARK\\ED.//MARK\\8 for a few weeks so I don't plan on getting another ultrasone unfortunately. I have 89000 songs, mainly lossless that I've traded with head-fiers and audiophile friends over the years; I listen to absolutely everything except most country and modern rap.
 
Right now I'm using the Mjolnir/Gungnir, running with DHC nucleotide xlr interconnects, tellurium Q usb (audible difference, yes), NRG-2 power cords, and the //MARK\\HD800 w/Q cable or nucleotide, //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 with nucleotide/ stock or //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 with nucleotide.
 
I will be seeing a friend with //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's and compare our pairs, he's also using Q cables. From what I was told, the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's respond a lot to different cables, and I am familiar with Q; so I'm looking forward to hearing a difference.
 
I'll let you guys know, most likely next friday but maybe sooner.
 
Also, I have to add again that the synergy with the BHA-1 for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 was better than with the mojo, and the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 seems to take a step up with the mjolnir; but I traded the bha-1and cash for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3

I guess you've mentioned that you really preferred the brighter sound of the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 (and less bright //MARK\\HD800s); and conversely disliked the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s for not being as bright as you'd like them to be. So I'm figuring that the Audeze "sound" if I could use that phrase, isn't to your liking. But technically, both are outstanding headphones with the nod going to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s in terms of a flatter FR response, better square wave responses, being a faster driver, and even lower distortion (I'm of course referring to the post-RMA versions of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s). Sound stage wise I found them about on par; which for me was a great improvement over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s (either revision). Just to confirm, my comparisons were done with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s on my (now sold WA22) and on my brother's McIntosh speaker amp. I personally think the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s do sound best from a good speaker amp, but the difference isn't as huge as many have stated (again IMO).
 
While I can happily live with the 6kHz peak on the //MARK\\HD800s, //MARK\\I found that the wider peak (over a wider frequency range) on the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s a bit too much for me to truly enjoy them fully. In that regard (along with Tyll's measurements) I can see why some (like Tyll) actually prefer the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s.

I'm seriously bummed. When I hear someone mention that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 can be very detailed up high and comparable to the //MARK\\HD800 minus the harshness, that's definitely not what I'm hearing.
 
I'm convinced they're veiled, yet they're said to be RMA'd... Something is not right. One thing for sure, right now from what I'm hearing, it's a significant step up over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 //MARK\\r3, but not anywhere close to being a headphone worth almost 2 grand.
 
If I can make a small analogy, it's like if I had a 2.1 speaker system with boosted up bass on the sub and both speakers have damaged tweeters... 
 
I'm anxious to trade //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's for the week with a local audiophile; at that point I will be able to see (hear) what exactly to expect
 
Edit: Otherwise I was thinking if the magnets are damaged? Is it possible that the magnets are discharging?

A few thoughts....
 
If they are "a significant step up over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 //MARK\\r.//MARK\\3" then they are most likely not veiled; as the veiled pairs were reportedly a step back from the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s. Especially if you bought them brand new recently. Magnets don't discharge as you mentioned. I think the issue from this past January had more to do with driver tensioning or lack thereof (but this is far from being confirmed). That said, I've had my pair since Nov. 2011 without issue. I did send them back in April-May to be updated to the newest revision and you can find my thoughts on the differences on the wiki I wrote here a while back.
 
With regards to your comments...I seriously suggest that you listen to them for at least a week and not mix in other headphones. If at that time you still prefer the brighter and more peaky //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s, then you just might be a treble head.

do we ever stop to think that all these varied opinions about these headphones might come down everything BUT the headphones?
 
for example, with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, i have owned them since shortly after they were released, and i have gradually come to think of them as the best headphones i've personally ever heard.
 
when i first bought them i thought they were somewhat thin, bright, and analytical.
 
but this was down to my rig...
 
as my rig has improved, so has the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6.
each step of the way, as i've removed jitter and distortion from the audio signal, the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 has telegraphed these changes more faithfully than any other headphone.
 
i now have a headphone rig that blows my mind.
it is almost baffling to hear the clarity, layering, realism, and dynamics from my best cans (//MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500, //MARK\\HD800, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3).
 
i know it's an "//MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 lovefest" thread.
so, i'll throw in that I do truly love the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.
 
but...  the sound i hear now truly makes me wonder how some of those "old headphones" i've sold would now sound on my current rig...
The //MARK\\Beyer //MARK\\T1, for example.  i always found them bright.
 
And i know the quality of a rig cannot change the FR of a headphone.   but what it can do is change the perception of that FR.
and quality treble is a lot easier to swallow than hashy treble.
in fact, the quality of treble can become so good that it will almost convert someone into a treble head...

Sonically, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is an upgrade over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.  It is not a $1,000 upgrade, as most have stated.  Diminishing returns and all that jazz.  Comfort-wise, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is a significant upgrade over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.  To me, that's what you are really paying $1k for.  The comfort.
 
You can state diminishing returns all you want, and it's obviously the truth, but at the end of the day you're spending 1k for comfort and small sound quality increase (the word small being relative, when in comparison to the price paid for it.)   If these were $500 more expensive than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2, then it would be more likely to be considered a large increase in sound quality.
 
All things have to be considered in context...but no, these are not a significant upgrade in sound quality for the price paid.  I do enjoy their sound more than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2s I own, but I prefer the extra comfort the most.

Well I never cared much for orthos prior to the //MARK\\LCD3.  Even the //MARK\\LCD2 rev. 2 didn't drive me to make a move to supplement the //MARK\\HD800, as good as they were.  But the //MARK\\LCD3 are just fantastic with excellent transient response (though not as razor detailed as the //MARK\\HD800, but far superior bass response).  I didn't much care for the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 the few times I've heard them and it is very inefficient, but tastes will vary obviously.  They are good phones, just not for me.  My balanced Beta with a gain of 2 isn't enough to drive them well anyway, so even if I wanted them I'd need to reconfigure the boards for higher gain (which I have no desire to do since it is perfect for the //MARK\\HD800///MARK\\HD650///MARK\\LCD3.)
 
Yes, I heard the Stratus but only with a pair of //MARK\\DT770 he had there, and I've never heard Beyers sound that good.  They sounded more like high-end phones out of that amp.  Donald definitely made a great amp for sure.

Yeah, some of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 specs certainly look better, but a few of the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 specs also look a bit better, though i would say some of the more important ones seem better on the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s.
 
thats cool, its one of the amps im interested in down the road.
 

 
Hahaha this is true, and thats one of the reasons i think ill like it more, and why i loved the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 so much, all that bass impact. I had a bad experience with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s the first time i heard them at CHiUniFi, which was also the first time i heard the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 actually, and i thought the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s sounded like garbage, but i soon after realized they must have been a veiled pair. And after i read purrin describe one of the veiled pairs he heard as a subwoofer on an AM radio i knew that thats what i had heard. So im really excited to hear a good pair and compare them.

Nah. I like listening loud on occasion, but not nearly as much as I used to. I already had a huge scare a few months back where half the hearing in one ear went out for a few days. It was my tempor tympani muscle (spelling?) acting up (as a reflex) and protecting my ears so fortunately it was only temporary but it scared the hell out of me, and I wasn't even listening that loud when it happened. It's there to protect your ear from loud noises.
You only have one set of ears. Protect them. And if anyone tells you you need a 15W amp to properly drive the //MARK\\LCD3 you can tell them they're high. Sure, headroom is good but you don't need nearly that much. For the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 I could see that though. Doesn't the DarkStar have something like 50 or 100W per channel headphone output? That's just insane. Regardless of how it sounds, I laughed pretty hard when Ray (I think it was) said you could hear the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 like speakers from across the room. Because of course, that's why we all buy headphones.....to use as speakers.  And Ray had once told me at CanJam that he listened louder than anyone he knew, until he heard me listening to the //MARK\\HD800 on one of his amps.

Its weird, i almost think that the sides are on backwards, the only way for me to get the headband to lay flat is for it to be all the way to the front of my head, never had a headphone like that before.
 

 
 
But it is super comfortable and extremely detailed.
 

 
 
First impressions would be that its more balanced than the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s, i had felt that they had a bit of a midrange dip, that isnt there anymore. The bass is a bit more impactful as well. I would even say that the soundstage is bigger which wasnt something i was expecting, since the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s werent particularly strong in that area. So far i do like them more than the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s
 
And the build quality is quite a large step up i would say, they just look/feel a whole lot nicer than the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s do.
 
But now i know what people were talking about with the suction in your ears when you put them on, the first couple times that was pretty weird, but i got used to it pretty quickly
 
Preproman, as far as a comparison between the F1 and the amp in the D2, i would say there isnt any comparison. The F1 blows it away in pretty much every way. Fuller sound, better bass impact, larger soundstage, more "3d" sounding performers, and the highs are a bit smoother as well. Its just too much amp for them, now i really want to hear them out of the Mjolnir

Topic: 8892615 in thread 588429

Haha, it seems that many of the newer sets all look mostly identical, but i would agree our two are almost perfectly identical.
 
Another thing i noticed was that i can hear an ever so slight amount of noise out of the F1 using the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s, that i couldnt hear with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s. and its so slight you would never know it was there if i just handed you the cans and told you to put them on your head, you have to unplug it from the amp to notice the ever so slight difference of complete silence. Pretty awesome for a speaker amp I'd say, though it is known as being one of the quietest speaker amps ever made.
 
EDIT: Anyone ever compare the Norse Cables Norn series 2 to the Q Cables? looks the same except with OCC copper rather than regular copper, and cotton instead of silk sleeving, not sure about the price on the Norse though

That doesn't sound normal about the headband. Mine is in the middle of my head. Either you have crooked ears or they could have put it on wrong. There are a few ways you can angle the headphones for different sound quality but if you have them upright they should be more or less in the middle.
An interesting thing I was playing around with was wearing the headphones backwards and reversing the cables. It's not better than the normal way but rather a different sonic style. The bass moves towards the front and has more accurate imaging and the treble is smoother, the mids a bit more forward and lush but definitely a loss of transient response. I tried them for a few hours this way and found the signature quite relaxing to listen to, but it's not better than the standard orientation, just different. Certainly worth trying though to see if you like the sound.

Yup same problem here.  In the position where the rectangular earcup holes are perfectly vertical, the headband sits more or less on the middle of my head, and is flat, horizontal to the ground, but angled so much relative to the downward slope of my head that only about 25% of the headband is actually contacting my skull. If I rotate them backwards to the headband is angled away from my forehead, I can wear the headband on the back of my head where it begins to slope downward the headband slopes very nicely to sit flush against my skull.  I can also achieve a mostly flush fit if I rotate them forwards and wear the headband towards the front of my head, nearly on my forehead, as you did in your photo. Of course I could just have an oddly sloped head.  Part of the problem too is that the headband has so little cushioning, and very hard edges.  Maybe a custom padding mod?  For me this is a bigger comfort issue than the weight -- not that it's nearly bad enough to prevent me from enjoying them.

A question about storing these headphones -- I've seen a number of mentions here that they definitely shouldn't be stored compressed, but is it a good idea to keep the styrofoam block between the earpieces that it comes shipped with when they're not in use?  I'm definitely concerned about the pad compression issue, but does this potentially put to much pressure on the drivers?  Or is the pressure each earpad puts on the other when they're allowed to rest against each other (not compressed, just their natural force) likely not enough to worry about the compression issue?  
When wearing these things, given how much pressure is put on the forward portion of the earpad, with almost no pressure put on the back portion of the earpads, it's hard to imagine how there could not be some significant differential compression over time.  It seems very uneven in how the lateral compression/clamping force isn't applied evenly around the ear, at least in my case. Does anyone else find this to be the case?  I may need to try shifting them forward more, but of course there's a limit to how far forward they can go.

Yes, they do need to be put all the way down to their lowest height setting to fit in the plastic case properly, which does become somewhat of a pain since I have to readjust them to the height of 4 to fit comfortably when I want to use them.  I don't leave any of my headphones out because where I live dust accumulates so fast that I literally have to dust my gear off once a week if I want to keep it spotless.  That's fine for components but not for headphones where dust can seriously affect the performance of the drivers.
 
I keep the styrofoam between the pads, and I don't think it puts any pressure on the drivers, rather it seems to just push on the cloth covering the magnets (and the magnets themselves).  I believe the entire structure is attached to the earcups so it shouldn't be putting pressure on the drivers unless you had some serious clamping force issues or intentionally forced them to fit in the case with the headband extended.

The Mjolnir and the B22.  For my kind of music I just loved them with the B22.  For Death or Trash Metal they sound really good on the Mj.
 
For me the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is a real upgrade from the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2.  When I get the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 I can see the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2 not getting much head time at all.  The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 does everything the 2's does and fixes what they do wrong.  It's just a better headphone over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2 overall IMO.
 
For my money the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 just does vocals better.  The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is still a tab bit on the dark side when compared to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 but when compared to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2 they're not dark at all.  The 3's just kinda fit right in the middle. 
 
For me the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 is still "KING".  However, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is a very close 2nd and I mean very close.  If all I ever had was headphone amps and never experienced the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s on speaker amps, then yes for me the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 would be KING.  But sense listening to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6s on a variety of high quality speaker amps they're just able to do things other headphones can't.  
 
Yes the treble on the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 is a tad sparkly when compared to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 but it's also very well extended with no hint of harshness or peaks that I hear.  The clean crisp presentation of the music is of the best I've heard and only second to the 009s the 007 MKIIs maybe.  
 
You can point to measurements all day long.  They just don't show you the scalability of these headphones.  No other headphone is able to get better as your gear gets better.

I got a  Moon Audio Silver Dragon headphone cable (balanced with Furutech Rhodium XLR connectors) and this is absolutely a great cable for the //MARK\\LCD3s, especially improving the control, detail, speed, texture, and transparency of the bass.
I always try to get my phones to the point where nothing in any frequency "stands out" unnaturally, and the Silver Dragons do this perfectly to the //MARK\\LCD3s.
The imaging is now more rounded and there is more of a sense of open space.
Vocals, instruments, percussion, you name it, are full of life, unclouded, but not painful in the least. Piano (something I always concentrate on) is gorgeous and resonant but not sloppy or full of overhang.
I spent several hours testing the new cables with a variety of music with the //MARK\\LCD3s , which formerly could be sometimes a little thumpy or opaque, and now all is well.
Over the last year, I kept thinking, well, the //MARK\\LCD3s are good, but maybe future //MARK\\LCD4s will improve things, but that idea has left my mind with the improvement from the Silver Dragon cable.

loving the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 right about now...
listening to Fat Bottomed Girls.
i mean, who doesn't like that song, right?   
 
my only beef with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 and 3 is that for some reason the lambskin ear pads attract tiny bits of skin and oil, and those gradually get trapped in the tiny creases of the ear pad.
i use Murphy's Oil Soap and a soft cloth, and clean them up every couple weeks...  
i don't know if it's my imagination, but they seem to need cleaning more often and more often...
 
and, no, please don't mention the vegan pads.  those things are hideous.   
 
but, to finish on a bright note, my current rig feels like "game over" for me.  for headphones audio at least.
 
jriver/jplay --> vaunix usb hub --> Silnote Audio silver USB cable --> Audiophilleo2 with PurePower --> WireWorld Gold Starlight 6 digital cable --> Human Audio Muto DAC --> Wireworld Gold Eclipse 6 RCA cables --> Apex Peak/Volcano (Sylvania 6SN7GTB currently) --> headphones (//MARK\\HD800, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500, etc.)
 
i list every component because i have come to feel very strongly that every single component is of at least some importance.
to achieve the kind of 3D holographic sound that is smooth, effortless yet dynamic and lifelike...
it's just like "wow'.
 
i described it to a friend as "driving a stolen lamborghini with Scarlett Johansen in the passenger seat, and cops on your tail."

I've had the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 for about three weeks now. Overall I must say I really like this headphone. It has a very natural and free from sibilance rendition of the human voice, the midrange otherwise is sweet, dark, and liquid. Very smooth midrange.  Small groups of instruments or individual instruments are portrayed with great detail and warmth. This includes genres such as rock, folk, electronica, jazz, and small scale classical groups. Dynamics, bass response and small scale performance clarity, and the ability to convey power are extremely impressive. However, with orchestral music involving large groups of instruments playing simultaneously, or with large choral groups, these headphones tend to lose their focus. They  sound somewhat congested and lack clarity or space when the music has many simultaneous performers. It's as if the drivers can only focus on a few things going on at once for some inexplicable reason.
So this headphone, with small scale ensembles, including very powerful rock/electronic and also delicate /jazz/classical groups, does incredibly well assuming a good recording. But this level of performance (for me at least) does not extend to large classical complex choral or orchestral music.

OK, so...I'm new to all of this, I get that.  However, I've been a 2-channel guy for a while, and I've heard what happens to equipment over time.  I've also got a degree in acoustics, so I at least can get somewhat of a grasp on how everything works (definitely not bragging here, just giving context).  Sure, I've had these for a day.  Sure, there are more expensive amps out there.  The Lyr more than satisfies what Audeze suggest for these.  At $2000+$450, these do sound better than my PSB M4U2's, but I'm sorry, these have a LOOOOOONG way to go before they come close to my $560 Paradigm Shift a2 powered monitors.  I use the same source for all of my music: MOG via Macbook pro over an optical or usb DAC.  Absolutely no complaints from my Paradigms or my 1.7's (and you can't tell me the 1.7s do not reveal "issues" upstream.)  Maybe it's just that I've been spoiled with that awesome sound stage in front of me produced by speakers, but even if these $2000 cans could approach them with even more money, damn...you're talking the same price (most likely way more) as a formidable Magnepan 1.7 system (among many other options). 
 
Sure, I know I'll get the arguments about not giving it time to break in, or the Lyr isn't a good match.  C'mon people!  The technology in this hobby (speaker or can) is nothing new...not by a long shot.  There is a certain placebo effect that no one likes to talk about.  We start on the less expensive stuff, just getting into things...move to bigger and bigger ($$$ and $$$$$$$) and we say it sounds better, because it damn well better considering what we just shelled out for it.  Well, I will say the $75,000 Magico system I heard was the best I've ever experienced in audio (that's just an insane amount of money, and not even half of what bigger systems go for).  But after hearing top-of-the-line cans vs. the $500 paradigms or $2200 Maggie 1.7's, no amount of money will bring these //MARK\\LCD's (or any headphone) to the level of audio that even a decent near-field system can yield--at least not for me.  Even my old Audioengine A5's kill them. 
 
Obviously this is my opinion, and I'm sure it isn't a popular one on these boards (no one likes a newbie talking schiit), but I'm just giving my honest opinion.  I could spend a year with these guys, but they'll never be speakers...not even close (nothing changes that much with break in).  I'm just a little shocked at how far off they really are, considering the cost.

No, I don't think it's unfair.  We're talking light years in sonic character differences here.

Sorry, maybe it's different in head-fi, but if there's one thing I learned in 2-channel hi-fi speaker system, the price tag doesn't impress me at all.  Just because something costs $2000 doesn't mean you need another $2000 to make it sound good.  And even 1000 hrs isn't going to make THAT big of a difference. 
 
The latter very well could sound better than what I've got, but still...I'd bet the farm they don't touch 25% of that cost in speakers.  The music will always be stuck in between your ears.  Throw $10,000 at a Source DAC Amp Can rig and I'd bet people are going to choose the sweetspot of a system with $2500 Tekton Pendragons and a $150, 35 wpc amp from parts express playing off of an iPod. 
 
I'm sure I'm saying nothing new.  Speakers are not headphones.  To each their own, but I'm obviously a speaker guy.

Obviously you're new here, so I won't rage so hard :P
 
This is a headphones forum, and specifically, the //MARK\\LCD3 appreciation thread. Going on about speakers and its superiority and how the //MARK\\LCD3's price is not justified at all isn't much appreciated. Most are already aware what speakers offer over headphones, but headphones do have their own advantages, and we have our reasons why we opted for headphones over speakers.
 
Further, you have a Lyr, barely any hours, and you're claiming that anything more 'expensive' than the Lyr is just placebo, or something among the lines of this. But you're using MBP out directly into a Lyr. 
 
The choice was yours, to spend $1000 over the //MARK\\LCD2, when it's the general consensus that the //MARK\\LCD3 doesn't offer a large improvement over the //MARK\\LCD2. And yet, you're complaining how the //MARK\\LCD3's price is well under-justified in comparison to your $560 speakers. I'll leave it here.

Lol...disappointment thread.  No, I knew I'd come across this way, but I was really just trying to express my amazement at how much difference there is between cans and speakers.  Both you and Girls Generation are right to get on my case, and I sure don't blame you.  I will most likely (ok, I will) be returning these.
 
Sorry, Girls Generation, I'm not claiming it's "just placebo," I'm claiming the difference in these cans vs. what even near-field monitors can do for a small fraction of the cost is so big, no amount of money thrown at them will compete.  I had always thought the really high-end headphones would give you a lot of a high-end speaker sound for a lot less money.  I'm just expressing my disappointment in finding out I was wrong. 
 
Different strokes for different folks is all.  I'd rather run the risk of pissing off my neighbors than sacrificing so much just to be sure I don't rattle their walls.

Sorry, but the Lyr doesn't satisfy what the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s need. I owned that very combination and we far from impressed with the Lyr. It worked quite well with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s, but really left me wanting more for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s (compared to the WA22 that I had on hand at the same time). Sorry, but I don't understand why people would buy top flight cans like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s and //MARK\\HD800s and then not worry about upstream gear? Then they post, I don't hear what all the fuss is about. Don't blame transparent headphones like these for showing you what issues you have upstream. While you might have got away with it with say mid-fi headphones, the same rules don't apply here. So before one make bold assertions, I'd strongly recommend you get out there to a meet and listen to other gear....the experiences may surprise you.

+1 Well said!
 
I can't believe what I'm reading here. Although I don't have my //MARK\\LCD3 yet, I do still have my //MARK\\LCD2.//MARK\\2 and //MARK\\HD800. I can confirm that your upstream gear is FAR more important in headphone audio than it is with 2 channel speaker systems. I just upgraded my HA160/Bifrost combo to a Soloist/M51 combo and the difference was jaw dropping to say the least. I've owned many great speaker systems, including top of the line Paradigm Signatures, and I would take my current headphone rig over the Paradigm's every day of the week. That's not to say that speakers don't have their own list of advantages, but in terms of pure enjoyment and quality of sound, high end headphones measure up quite nicely, imho. What I would say to the folks above who disagree with this is very simple, go try your //MARK\\LCD3 with some better quality upstream gear, then come back and tell us we are wrong...
 
But, again, it's apples and oranges.

i agree with the points made.
 
2 channel guys (who make up a great majority of audiophiles) would probably not agree, but headphones allow for much greater analysis of upstream gear than speakers.
 
with my Harbeth 2-channel rig, i am perfectly happy with my current gear.
 
i have switched gear out with other gear over the past few months, and the differences were subtle but noticeable.
this basically let me know that money would not be wisely spent to buy something uber high-end for that setup...
 
however, with headphones such as //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500, //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, and //MARK\\HD800, i have been able to appreciate ongoing upgrades in gear, and as a result have heard detail retrieval, noise floor, soundstage size, smoothness, etc. all improve over time with the same headphones.
 
i am sometimes amazed at the positive reviews some gear receives in popular publications.  especially source gear.  
gear that i have tried out with headphones and been sorely disappointed with.  
 
my guess is that the reviewers' 2-chanel rig sounded quite nice with this gear.
but it's not good enough for summit-fi headphone rigs.

Yes, I'm realizing that now.  The headphone world really is just a different audio experience than the speaker world. 

Well, maybe it's a different animal when it comes to cans, then.  I'll just say I've gone through many a A/B blind comparison of gear in the speaker realm, and very rarely is it the case that the more expensive amp/DAC/interconnect combo knocks me out.  Almost invariably, it's the change in speaker that makes the biggest difference (and room treatment, of course...While I'm sure people will say that's an advantage of headphones, I will say a little effort in room treatment can really make a difference for very little money, whereas with cans, it seems you can only change gear to change the sound.) 
 
Anyway, I'll leave it at that.  Thanks to both of you for not jumping down my throat and giving me some constructive info from your experiences.  These really are beautiful, very nice sounding headphones.

I wonder what's going on   I loved the bass coming out of the //MARK\\LCD3s, SE stock cable and using a Audio~gd 11.32 and I think its way less now.
 
I've now had the Bellina with the Mullard and a Whiplash Twag v3 and Twcu v3 hybrid cable for a couple of weeks with @110 burn-in on both. I'm not sure how much better this 12 X more in $$ cost set up sounds, if at all? I think the bass quantity is diminished and I cannot say tighter, in fact I don't like the bass missing. Am I mistaken? I mean I know we all hear things differently but still why would it be gone? Cable?
 
Tomorrow I'm going to A/B like this: 
 
Bellina from computer via usb.11.32 from Pure 20 via toslink.LCD Whiplash balanced for Bellina and SE adaptor for the 11.32.I will have the same exact song playing on both at the same time and quickly change between the two.  I will be able to just add se adaptor going from Bellina to 11.32.

I just bought myself a pair of these to go along with my Burson Conductor. Fabulous combination, I must say. Absolutely blows my old //MARK\\HD650/BCL/sound card combination out of the water in every conceivable way.
 
I will add however, that proper positioning for these headphones seems to be *extremely* important; as it is with any headphone obviously, but to the point where I'm spending literally minutes finely adjusting them on my head until they sound just right. My //MARK\\650's on the other hand, had that "sweet spot" I could find instantly. My first impressions of the //MARK\\LCD's were actually rather terrible because I had yet to spend the required hour (or more) finding that perfect spot over my ears.
 
They're absolutely beautiful sounding headphones, but ONLY when placed precisely so. Any micro adjustments affect the sound pretty dramatically. 
 
I'm being picky though. That small gripe aside, I'm absolutely thrilled with these - both cosmetically and sonically. I'll be keeping the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's and Burson for the distant foreseeable future. Truly an amazing combination.

After spending a ton of time with a late 2012 //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 powered via HeadRoom's BUDA I have come to love the sound.  To me the cost would be worth it had the headband been constructed more like the //MARK\\STAX //MARK\\009 headphone.  The sound signature is just about perfect with plenty of speed, detailed and well extended at both ends of the frequency response curve, and certainly the looks are amazing.
 
They remain their best headphone to date and probably the best headphone under $5000, but it would great to see that headband redesign and a 40% drop in price.  I think more people would immediately be on board if that occurs.
 
For those looking for that top-end headphone the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 will not disappoint.  The great thing about them is an amp like the O2+ODAC combo drives them quite well making the amp selection affordable.

They were not perceived as issues until I tried the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s, side by side with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s. That was at King Audio, a Headphone store in Hong Kong last weekend. The source was a highend Marantz SACD player and amp was a Vioelectric V200. That V200 was a very sweet sounding piece. Very tube like in all the best ways.
First thing I noticed, was that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 were quite a bit more comfortable. The thicker, plusher leather earpads were very comfy and the headband fit my head better.
Listening to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s first, I could tell the sonic signature was similar to my own. Then on first listen to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s, there was just less grain, more soundstage, clarity, high frequency detail, and just plain balanced and more natural sounds coming from the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s. With only 30 seconds head time, I wanted the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s
After buying a pair of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s from ALO Audio when I returned home, I can't get the new headphones off my head. Something I could not say about my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s. Could only listen to those for a few hours before listener fatigue set in.
How substantial are the differences? I'd say evolutionary, not revolutionary. They still sound like Audeze headphones, but with more refinement in areas I value. The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is a better fit to my audio priorities, where the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s were very good, but did not rise up to end game potential for me.Edited by Jones Bob - 4/7/13 at 11:42am

Loved mine from day one also.  If you have a lot of experience with audio systems you can pick apart anything's deviation from "perfection", yes, even the //MARK\\big //MARK\\Stax.  It becomes more about what reminds on of music, not about what has no flaw.  
 
This forum and reviews often talk about tonal differences: laid back or forward mids; too much or too little highs; bass slam or not; deep bass or not.  That's all fine and dandy, but lack of grain and just plain old low distortion sound do not get a lot of play, and this is what my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 do for me.  Going back and forth with various big name phones, all the detail is there.  But they are low distortion, so nothing jumps out.  When I listen to voice, including operatic voices which are very difficult (tenors and sopranos) I hear great purity of voice, yet lots of transparency.  Same for horns.  True colers come through in an unforced way.

Yes, they are fantastic for opera voices.  Congratulations that you are becoming a fan of another type of music.  This always opens up the mind and spirit, and gives yet another source of pleasure.  For me, this is what the equipment is supposed to do: cause you to enjoy the art.  So frequently the equipment becomes the focus.  I find myself enjoying things much more when it is about the music and not the equipment.  And I see this with many of my clients when they gravitate (or I shove them) toward more natural, realistic equipment (as opposed to hyper detailed and "forced" equipment.  
 
If you are starting to enjoy opera and classical you are likely to get "grabbed" by them at some point.  With both, if there is enough interest to explore a bit, and get used to a few favorite pieces, it will lead to needing to hear more and more.

Hi DarKu, thanks for the nice compliment on my post.
 
I can say back to you that your words also resonate with me.  The //MARK\\HD800 are great, there is no denying that.  Detail, air, focus, imaging, dynamics.  They are a great tool for my to use in evaluating my equipment designs.  But I obtained the LCD-3 to possibly enhance the musical experience.  In that regard I was willing to give up some detail and top end extension.
 
Instead, although there is less emphasis on the highs, everything is there including the detail and realism.  I am surprised, I thought I would live with colored sound to get the musical ease I wanted.  Instead, I really gave up nothing in terms of actual detail it appears.
 
An example, I use the //MARK\\HD800 to set up phono cartridges, I can hear little tracking details that I cannot hear with any speaker with such certain clarity.  I happened to play that record I use for this test, not looking for those details, just listening for fun.  When that section came, there were the little cues I use to check the setup, clear as day.  There were many other fine details that I heard during the day with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 that represent the lowest level details I have heard with the //MARK\\HD800.  
 
I will not say that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 are better for everyone over the //MARK\\HD800, and I am not prepared to sell the //MARK\\HD800.  But for me, as you said "what is more important than pure joy of relaxing and music listening with a big smile on your face? Nothing".  And this, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 really allow you to do.  
 
Thanks again for your nice words.

I don't need to cause hard feelings, just a little joke for those who have read his posts, but true at the same time.  Just a side of human nature of some folks. The type of guy who has to list all he has, inside the hobby and out.  
 
Back to fun things, your thing about placement of instruments, funny, I find great left to right precision in the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, kind of above my head, but somehow my mind translates that to a spread in front of me.  
 
The Stax, Koss, //MARK\\Sennheiser //MARK\\HD800 don't really show me that much more or less, just differences in all of them.  The //MARK\\HD800 a bit more outside my head, but still require that "translation".  
 
The //MARK\\Stax //MARK\\Sigma are definitely more "out of the head" for me than any others I have, but I don't find myself loving them like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.  In head, out of head, or out in front of me with speakers, seems I can fall into the music if the realism and beauty are there, long as things are not moving randomly in position.

I listened to a lot of speaker systems but could never get the same level of involvement in the music. I think that's what make me love headphones, it puts you in the music, not in front. A matter of taste. Also the best speakers systems I could ear, the last was some Cabasse Baltic/Thor 4 way system, where very very fine with well recorded music (like Diana Krall indeed) but impossible to listen to something less well recorded, too harsh. With //MARK\\LCD3 you can listen and enjoy any music with any kind of recording quality (even if you fell the difference of course!). In one hand I don't have money and space to get one speaker system for each type of music, on the other hand I don't want to choose the music according to recording quality only, that's stupid; I will not stop listening to Coltrane or Dylan because the recording quality is not that good!
So I was on a search for a speaker system and couldn't find yet what I was expecting in term of music enjoyment, and //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3/BHA-1 combo make me stop searching, for the moment and hopefully for a while...
 
Something else with //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3/BHA-1 combo: you can listen for hours without tire your ears. I put it on the purity of the sound coming out, it's natural so not tiring.

Hello Head-fiers and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 owners,
 
I've just received my pair (leather pads) yesterday !
 
After several years spent with the //MARK\\HD650, I wanted something that would improve significantly the sound quality AND the enjoyment.  Since I had never listened to any Audeze headphones before purchasing them (didn't get the opportunity where I live), I was a bit worried not to really like them when they would enter my house ...
 
First of all, I was expecting them to be less comfortable than the //MARK\\HD650: I was wrong.  It's even more comfortable !
 
Then, I was thinking they would make the bass a bit fuller and more enjoyable: I was wrong again.  The bass on the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is HUGELY fuller than on the //MARK\\650 (and I mean it, I'm not the one to call a slight difference a big difference, quite the opposite actually).
 
Also, I was hoping that the medium and treble would be as close as possible as on the //MARK\\650: my hope was absurd.  While not far apart, they are still different enough not to find the LCD sound like an //MARK\\HD650 I love so much.  But the treat is that I prefer the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 after comparing them !  All I can say is that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is more engaging to listen to and more detailed at the same time.  I even had not dreamt it would be possible !  I am truly impressed, cause I thought it would have taken me days or even weeks to take pleasure in another sound than the one I've been used to for years now.  And it only took me a little more than an hour.  The first hour, as I thought, was having me fighting to like them because I had been listening so much to a different sound before.
 
Last of all, I want to thank you all head-fiers and reviewers (especially Tyll Hertsens from innerfidelity) since I bought the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 only based upon your opinions and comparisons with the Senn sound.  And of course, I thank the Audeze team !

Hello Paul Meakin,
 
I like your first name very much, if you see what I mean ;-)
 
I will try and improve my description of the differences between the //MARK\\HD-//MARK\\650 and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 for you.  The first thing which striked me was the lack of medium focus that is the trademark of the Senns.  As I was used to the //MARK\\HD650 for more than 3 years, I didn't enjoy the first listening hour because of this, and I think that's a standard "acoustic psychology phenomenon" if you allow me to say it like that.  In other words, I was just a little annoyed by the sudden difference in the sound on the songs I liked on the //MARK\\HD650, I guess no one can hold me guilty for this ...  Actually, to my ears, there is no focus on any frequency range on the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, which is a good thing and means easy EQ-ing for those who want to.  (I don't, and I never did on the HD650 either.)
 
The second thing I perceived is almost the same as the first one, and it was the lack of "clarity" in hi-med / very low treble (around 4 kHz I would say) and also in low/med treble (around 8 kHz ?) compared to the //MARK\\HD650.  But it didn't take me more than an hour to realize it was purely subjective and that it was once more due to my ears used for so long to the //MARK\\HD650 sound.  So, there is no lack of clarity or only with "bad" recordings.  In the song "Thriller" from MJ for example (to take a well-known song) everything is perfect, and no lack of clarity or whatever is perceived even for someone used to the //MARK\\HD650.  But for some recordings which are already not very "clear" in those frequency ranges, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 will not change it (which is normal) and the //MARK\\HD650 will help to make the sound more intelligible (which is cool but not very neutral to say the least).
 
The third thing I felt was the presence and accuracy of the bass.  That's really what I wanted with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, and I was so scared to be disappointed as far as the bass is concerned.  What is really cool about it is that it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the spectrum, while really wrapping the music into it.  There is no mid-bass bump as on the //MARK\\HD650 (which has always annoyed me) and so you hear the 100 Hz bass as loud as the 40 Hz one.  Ultra-COOOL, just what I was waiting for !  The //MARK\\HD650 could go down easily to 30 Hz (and even below) BUT the sound pressure level was audibly fainter at 30 Hz than at 100 Hz, resulting in a bass not really enjoyable (to my taste), not accurate enough (coloured in the horrible 100 Hz region, the one I hate ...)  And of course, there is no hint of bass distortion on the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, even in the 25 Hz zone, even at pretty loud volume (tried it with a 28 Hz sine wave on the Soloist, low-gain, volume attenuator at 3 o'clock and Cowon X9 at full volume - an unpleasant sound pressure level for my ears for more than a few seconds !)
 
The fourth thing is a little more subtle, and was one I had totally forgotten with the Senns: the "hi-highs" (14 kHz and above).  The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is a lot clearer in this part of the spectrum, and in this frequency range it doesn't make the sound more aggressive or sibilant or fatiguing, it only adds detail and air to the sound compared to the //MARK\\HD650.  Totally re-discovered this spectrum range in the songs I like !  Helps a lot with the spatialization as well ...
 
Please don't flame me if you own the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and don't have the same feelings as I have, my description of the differences between the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and the //MARK\\HD650 is purely subjective (not measured) and depend on my hearing and my tastes, so I am not criticizing any of the two headphones !  Since you surely don't have the same ears and same tastes as I have, your opinion will differ (quite) a bit ...  No one is right or wrong, that's part of the hobby as I see it :-)
 
Thanks for reading and let me know if it helps you, Paul :-)

Have had the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's for the past few days and I'm finding them good but not amazing so far. 
 
I think they are more amp dependent than I would expect but that's not really a problem as I have different amps.  I did not like the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2.2 compared to the r1; in fact GG's //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2.2 used to be mine.  I will say that the 2.2's were more even keeled which was not what I was after at the time.
 
Maybe it's in my head but so far I think the r1's are better at sounding good with poorly mastered recordings while the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's will more easily show the flaws; suppose this can be a good or bad thing.  Case in point NIN and Lacuna Coil, the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's have me reeling about the compression in these CD's while I never gave it a second thought before.  Throw in some well mixed jazz and I'm smiling again.
 
I don't have r1's to directly compare but I would also venture a guess that the 3's may be able to play lower levels of bass but are not as hard hitting as the r1's which I considered to be borderline basshead phones.  The 3's are still fun, just maybe not as fun in this regard.
 
The pads are also significantly different to what I was used to, I think I like these a little better in the comfort, they feel luxurious and noticeably more squishy than the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2's stiff pillows.  Not sure if long-term use would hold up equally as well.
 
Hopefully I will hang onto these at least a little longer!

For those of you interested in making the jump to the //MARK\\LDC3s, I'm passing along something out of the deals thread.
 
Sound Earphones has a deal that I took advantage of this morning by ordering 4 x $500 gift cards from them. Each gift card is 20% off. Everything took place today. I copied a post from the deals thread below for the rest:
 
 
I ordered 4 x $500 gift cards from Sound Earphones for $1,600. I did this very early in the morning, taking the risk my plan would work out.
 
I got an email saying the 4 x $500 gift cards were being shipped via USPS. I used their chat to make sure the gift cards could be stacked. Drew responded that for this promotion, they could be stacked. He also said I should have receive the gift card code via email, which I did not. He immediately emailed me the code.
 
I then placed an order for the //MARK\\Audeze //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. With the 20% effective discount, that put the brand new //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 at $1,556. There was no tax since I don't live in Ohio. I did get the free overnight shipping via FedEx. I should get them tomorrow. There is still $55 left on my gift card. The website says it will never expire.
 
Note: Sound Earphones website lists only the balanced XLR cables in their included notes. Drew confirmed that they order straight from the manufacturer and don't open the boxes. So, it should include both balanced and SE cables. I'll find out tomorrow.
 
My experience with these guys was exceptional. They have great service, and a great return policy that is more than fair. I highly recommend them!
 
As of today, the promotion is still good!

Just to add to the //MARK\\LCD3 review, every time I listen to my //MARK\\LCD3s, I find more things I love about them, like these:
 
1. They are all about atmosphere. They create a lovely soundfield that is not stark like a desert and not thick either, but contains just the right touch of humidity that conveys a virtual large soundspace
that you can breathe deep in. It's kind of like the dark matter the physicists talk about. It's like a volume of air, as opposed to a vacuum, that binds the instruments and vocals
in a cooperative cohesion that creates a substantial musical wholeness. I guess this is what I sense in a concert hall with great acoustics. 
It's also along the lines of what I hear with tube amps, a very gentle mist that doesn't obscure anything, but just creates a perfect environment for the music.
 
2. In the midst of this environment, just like in a live event, suddenly I can get startled and thrilled by the impact of a blast of percussion or a piano note (or any instrument that
has a strong energetic blast, like the blat from a brass instrument). And this one of the things I love about a live event, like a concert or a Broadway play, where it just comes out of nowhere and wakes you up,
but in without pain because it is so natural. It's a great thrill. The //MARK\\LCD3s combine the friendly musical atmosphere with the ability to shock and surprise and always keep me guessing
about what I'm going to hear even on music I've known for decades.

I purchased them mostly for transportable use - so I will be using them primarily with Solo -dB and Pico Power when traveling - quite nice.   I listen to loudspeakers primarily at home, so I probably won't get a full size headphone amp anytime soon.  At home I use an Ayre QB-9 with the Pico Power - was constantly shaking my head at the sound of this combination with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's - amazing, and I don't often use that description with audio.  The Solo isn't even close to being in the same league as the QB-9.  Hard to imagine what more a high end headphone amp would bring to the table, though if past experience holds true, I'll be shaking my head even more once I take that step.
 
A GS-X mk2 would be near the top of my list - but I just don't know how much listening time it would get at present.

I'm coming from the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500, which had a very velvety, creamy bass that I loved. I was hoping the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 would take the bass to another level. At first, I was disappointed, as the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's bass, though technically superior in all ways, lacked that creaminess. It sounded too clinical and dry to me. However, after 3 weeks of ownership and about 60 hours of listening, I find I am enjoying the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s more and more. The bass seemed to "break" in and after forcing myself to listen only the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s for two weeks, I find the difference less than I originally remembered. I have never listened to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s in any variant.
 
I don't know what to think of break in period, but with both the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, I find the more I listen to them, the more I enjoyed them. Even if only psychological, I definitely notice "burn in." I almost sent the LCD-3 back after a week, but am glad I did not.
 
Because of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, I am now listening to modern jazz. I'd never cared for it before, but I love listening to the likes of Norah Jones through the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s. 
 
I also find the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s to be awesome headphones for watching movies with my Cowon Z2. I still haven't pegged the accuracy of the surround sound, but it just "feels" like I'm in a movie theater. They are the best sounding home theater headphones I've ever heard. As much as I love the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500s, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s just blow away the HiFiMan for movies. I think this is where the technical excellence of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s really shine.

Everyone's got their own ears and levels of presbycusis.
 
 
It depends on what amp you use.  I also should have said //MARK\\HD800 w/o anax mod, w/ the anax mod I'd say they come very close to the //MARK\\LCD3 surpassing the //MARK\\HE6 in terms of neutrality.  I also think its odd you think the //MARK\\T1 as being brighter than the //MARK\\HD800.  I'll agree that maybe the //MARK\\SR007's are a bit more bright than the //MARK\\HE6 though.
 
Also I'm not alone.  Not that their opinion is law, but Tyll and Skylab also think so...
 
"I think the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is probably closer to neutral in terms of frequency response than the //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800. Bass is flatter, fewer peaks in the highs. Resolution and imaging is better on the //MARK\\800s for me though." -Tyll
 
" I find the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 to have just a touch more treble energy than is neutral, although overall I find the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 to be an absolutely outstanding pair of headphones, and I listen to them at work almost daily.  The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 were just better, in every dimension, IMO.  Which isn’t to take away from the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, but I found the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 to be more neutral, and just slightly more transparent." -Skylab

Astounded, Appreciative, and Amped.
 
Last week I auditioned an //MARK\\LCD2.//MARK\\2 at home. There were no //MARK\\LCD3 available for in-home audition.
 
The //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2.2 took about 5 entire albums to open up (even though demo unit was thoroughly broken in). At the sixth album, my jaw dropped to the floor. I listened for hours into the night, in utter disbelief. As soon as my dealer was open the next day I bought the last //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 he had on the shelf (demand is very high, many dealers including Audeze direct, are out of stock!).
 
Initially I'll be driving the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 with my RSA Raptor... but I want to really maximize the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's potential. I ordered a Decware Taboo MK III to audition (which will take about eight weeks to arrive) and I'll be ordering the Woo Audio WA5-LE as well.
 
Has anyone heard both the Decware Taboo III and the Woo WA5-LE, preferably side by side, using the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s? What are your thoughts on which is better suited for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s?
 
Cheers and thanks in advance for your comments.

I understand this statement completely.
 
My experience is the biggest difference in the SQ after the //MARK\\LCD3s was the PS PWD II. I was using a Audio-gd 11.32 with the LCDs up until getting this DAC.
 
When I first listened to the 11.32 with the //MARK\\LCD3 it was a complete WOW session. And for the 5 months thereafter, from time to time as I was listening I would have WOW moments.
 
Now ever session is a WOW one. Not in every song because I have some really poor recordings like bootlegs of concerts, but those aside it is amazing to me the depth and the broad spectrum of sound the PS brought to the table. I've just added a Mjolnir and I am awaiting for a Taboo to be built. The reason I know it was the PS DAC that made such a huge difference is before the Mjolnir I was using Ray's Hornet and the sound was still fantastic with the little amp. The Mjolnir took it to a new level but not close in as big an impact as adding the DAC did.

I really enjoyed the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 but for me it wasn't enough to justify the price.  My headphone preference is still the //MARK\\HD800/Mjolnir but often enough I crave a darker sound so the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 or //MARK\\HD600 hit the spot.  The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 was appreciably better in nearly every way (it actually had a soundstage, vocal separations within harmonies are amazing: listen to Beatles Love DVD-Audio and Yellow Submarine soundtrack for great examples that easily highlight the differences).  There were moments when I would prefer the intimate and subdued presentation of the 2 to the 3 but overall the 3 was more impressive.  The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 was also slightly more comfortable than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 due to the earpads.  However, for me it wasn't enough of an improvement to warrant the extra dough.  I'm going to hang on to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 and order some //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 earpads when the time comes to replace 'em.  I still think the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is the better headphone (at the same level of the //MARK\\HD800, just a different flavor) but value is relative.

With regard to open, airy, soundstage, and instrument separation.  Maybe you could hold the opinion that those things are all different, but I think they are all referring to the same quality as they are kind of mutually inclusive.  I mean I don't know of any headphone, speaker, iem that has great soundstage but terrible airiness.
 
I would agree that the //MARK\\LCD2 has relatively poor soundstage (or whatever you want to call it).  But when you say that the //MARK\\LCD2 is not open because it has distorted or dirty upper midrange or treble, I disagree.  The //MARK\\LCD2 certainly has clean midrange and treble its just not as emphasized to the same extent as the rest of the spectrum, which gives it a warm or dark signature.  Maybe I'm misremembering (or misinterpreting lol), but the waterfall plots were pretty clean throughout and support this view.
 
When you look at it that way then the //MARK\\LCD2's only downfalls are a merely "good" soundstage and a non neutral warm sound signature, but still has many redeeming qualities, e.g. extension, dynamics, impactful, quick transients, natural timbre, and low distortion even at absurd volumes.  Also, just because the //MARK\\LCD2r2 isn't their flagship doesn't mean it can't compete w/ the //MARK\\HD800 and //MARK\\HE6, after all plenty of people thought the //MARK\\LCD2 was superior to these headphones before the //MARK\\LCD3 came out.

Well, for my musical enjoyment they displayed more than a few weaknesses.  A poor soundstage is just "one" of them.  The lack of treble extension is another.  Also, if you read my post closely you will see I always say "compared to"  So yes - compared to the other 3 headphones the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2s lack in a few more areas that just one.  
 
When you get the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and //MARK\\HD800 right- the impact is just as or better than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2 - I would say better.  Also, the other 3 headphones IMO are much faster with transients when compared to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2.
 
I guess, for me that overly warm / dark signature is the opposite of what I like in a headphone.  When compared to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, //MARK\\HD800 and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 - the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2 are just to dark, slow and syrupy.  
 
Again, I'm only comparing the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2s to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and the //MARK\\HD800.

Well this is just my observation but the first thing I noticed when I used the //MARK\\HD800's was the clarity and crispness of everything. I was blown away with the sheer quality of what I was hearing. I mean everything was so detailed it made static sound good. 
However I myself began to notice the soundstage and how far apart it made the instrument on almost every recording that I can remember sound.  What I also began to notice, probably because of my listening preferences, is that having that separation really and truly slowed down the music and broke up the whole rhythm just enough for it to bother me. Now this may have been because the recording or even my components just aren't up to par but nonetheless its there for me. 
Here's an easy and quick way to hear what i'm talking about. Listen to Judas Priest. Maybe the song Turbo Lover a few times on a different set of cans. Then switch over to the HD800's and tell me if you can still get behind the beat. It'll prob sound great but something will be missing. At least for me it was.

=============================================

Well here is my take on the whole deal with the //MARK\\LCD2.//MARK\\2s: I am right this minute sitting here listening to CSNY Deja Vu and what I am missing right now this very second is a distinct lack of sound stage. And what I have started to define as something else that I am not absolutely crazy about: an overly warm signature with some lack of detail. That would put me in the unhappy position of owning these headphones and not being totally thrilled with them. Not that they are terrible but that they are not performing as well as I would like them to. Also there are going to be people who will read these performance analyses and will be dissuaded from buying them used. I think it is time to upgrade and may not be able to sell these cans but I guess I can keep them around if I ever get the urge to listen to some dark rolled-off treble musical compositions. Now the amp and dac I am using definitely do not contribute to this if anything they help get around the inherent limitations: Schiit Mjolnir and Gungnir dac which some may even [erroneously] claim to be treble tilted. Well it is my opinion that is not true but whatever. The fact is the Mjo is a brute of an amp and it is neutral and it slaps these LCDs into submission when it is time to rock and they do that. The problem is when it is not time to rock and then these cans are not all that. Oh well I have learned a lot about head-bound audio and could have done a lot worse with initial headphone selection. Nobody said it would be cheap to get to roughly end-game...

One headphone I wouldn't mind picking up again is the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500.  The //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 is more technically adept in certain areas (extension in bass and treble) and more transparent, but the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 was more enjoyable to me; it just felt more natural and midrange-centric.  If I didn't have the FirstWatt F1 I may have hated the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 but that combo really is something special and unique - I even preferred it to the //MARK\\K1000/F1 combo in most regards.  As time went on I simply reached for the //MARK\\HD800 more and found the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 a bit grating in a way I never felt with the //MARK\\HD800.  I also found the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 lacking in resolution and transparency compared to the //MARK\\HD800 so those departed.  However, every time I think about selling my LCDs I put 'em on my head, fire up some Led Zeppelin or Rush and then I quickly remind myself what I fool I must be for entertaining such a thought...

I've been wanting a pair of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s for months. I tried the //MARK\\LCD2.//MARK\\2 and liked them a lot, but i was missing the refinement in sound i'd been getting with the //MARK\\HD800 and //MARK\\T1. So i finally found myself in a position to get a used //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, providing I sell either the //MARK\\HD800 or the //MARK\\T1.
 
So, last week I sold the //MARK\\T1 and bought a pair of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s that had been bought new in January this year, and did not even have a lot of hours on them.
 
Bummer of bummers, within a week of getting them the right channel went out on me completely. Out like a light. Clicked back on for a few minutes and sounded fine, then went out again and stayed out. I have not read through this thread to try to analyze the repair hisory of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s in more recent times, but I do wonder about it.
 
Anyway, the folks at Audeze were nice as can be and promised to turn them right around, so I popped for overnighting them today to cali.with the hope that they would try to get them back out to me for Friday delivery. I REALLY want them back, as I was beginning to get addicted to what they could do for any music that kicks out (ie they made hi rez needledrops of Natty Dread sound just amazing, and though jazz in general sounded fine, on kick butt lps like Miles Jack Johnson (ah..miles and mcclaughlan, how nice!) they blew me away. also blew me away on all the rock I threw at them, including 45 rpm Led Zep. on quieter more acoustic based stuff I dug the //MARK\\hd800s more. but i was just scratching the surface, and had just moved away from tubes in the path to them to all solid state with my rsa hr2, and thought they REALLY liked the ss approach, when they died on me.
 
anybody with encouraging words is welcome to share them: i am bummed and frustrated.

//MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 Failures... hmmm... Should I be worried? Opinions appreciated.  
 
I have a //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2 on loan from The Cable Company (all their //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s were loaned out already). The 2.2 is fully broken-in a few times over and it sounds so good that I immediately ordered an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 without ever hearing it (based also on this thread and all the great reviews). I received the 3 this afternoon. Now I have to send the 2.2 back, but today and tonight, I'm spending hours AB-ing the two cans. Granted, it's not apples to apples, since the 3 is right out of the box and the 2.2 is fully settled in... but the 2.2 sounds better! More dynamic, fuller, richer, more musical sound overall.
 
So my question is to those of you who have or have had access to both units at the same time. Did your rev 2.2 sound better than the 3 initially, and how many hours of burn did it take to for the 3 to come out ahead? Or, do I have a compromised //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, as in the "failures" you mentioned (my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 chart is dated April 30) ?
 
Looking forward to hearing your experience and advice.
 
Cheers!

i think the //MARK\\he6 is an excellent can when powered by a properly functioning
and correctly biased vintage pioneer sa9100. it scales much better than
the //MARK\\lcd2.//MARK\\2; not even in the same arena actually. but the //MARK\\lcd3 is in the
same breath as the //MARK\\he6 with even less current being delivered. both
excels in resolution and transparency. the //MARK\\he6 being mid treble tilted
and the //MARK\\lcd3 being mid bass tilted. i didn't notice much treble etch
when powered by the reconditioned //MARK\\sa9100 (even on diana krall albums)
and the //MARK\\lcd3 doesn't suffer from one-note bleeding bass when fed
sufficient current.
 
as great as the //MARK\\he6 is, i couldn't get past the thinner sound when
compared to the //MARK\\lcd3, especially listening to piano and other string
instruments. it's like going from yamaha cf series to the bosendorfer cs
series. of course no one would characterize the yamaha cf series to
be thin sounding, but only when compared to the bosendorfer cs.

I've pointed this out many of times when talking //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6.  This comes down to subjective objective measuring.  Especially when the measurements of the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 was taking on a headroom amp  I would say that's false representation.
 
The //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 in my setup - the F1J a "current" driven amp, combined with the PWD mkII  will rival any dynamic / SS setup out there.   You'd have to get into big buck tube amps to compete.  I think wuwhere has monster tube amps driving his //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6.  
 
Now the //MARK\\HD800s and the GS-X mkII makes the above (1 and 1a) most of the times.  As for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.  While it sounds really, good on the GS-X mkII,  From memory, I still think I preferred it with the Mojo, Although I'd have to have it back in house to be sure.  Waiting on the Schiit Statement to have another pile of Schiit in the house..

Hi everyone
I had //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2 rev 2's for a year and recently traded them in for a new pair of //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's (am I the only woman with a pair of //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's? - I don' see much female contribution here).
I loved my //MARK\\lcd -//MARK\\2's but I am liking my 3's even more. I hear more treble while increased bass at the same time. I never got to compare them though as the courier picked up my 2's when delivering my 3's.
I had to do some tube rolling on my schiit lyr before i was really happy. I am using valvo e88cc's from 1964. They are really well balanced and a good fit with my system.
Interestingly, never having been convinced that interconnects make that much difference to the sound, i recently tried a pair of anti-cables in place of my moving air abbey road cable. Night and day difference. The abbey road added a lot of bass bloat and the anti-cables increase mids and trebles which are a good complement to my dark //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's and lyr. All together a better fit.
For me investing in //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3's are a significant financial decision, having a poorly paid job. But I think it was one of my best decisions. My music takes on a different dimension. A quality little old me never thought I'd ever hear.

No kidding! These cans are just over the top. I wanted to get some hours on them before commenting and each time I listen to them it is just another revelation. I really just cannot emphasize how much of an improvement these are over the //MARK\\LCD2.2s. And I thought those were pretty darned good too. I can only imagine how they might sound on some of the really esoteric amps and dacs these guys talk about on the forum. But the Schiit stack I have them on (Mjo/Gu) are really nice. I don't detect any aberrations to speak of as far as forward instrumentals, treble tilt, muddy bass or anything at all. And no need to crank it up to get at the details like I found myself doing with the //MARK\\LCD2.2s at times. Just crazy beautiful accurate detailed punchy imagery with an actual sound stage. I have no doubt at all the //MARK\\HD800s are awesome as well but now do not really feel an overwhelming need to audition anything else at least right away. I am however definitely looking forward to getting the Silver Widow cable to try them with.
It's all good...

Thanks commtrd for posting these great pictures!
 
Well.....I went ahead yesterday and ordered my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's from Justin @ Headamp. I have really really really been enjoying my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.2's that I got from him a few months back. My current //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 setup is very near perfection for my preferences, with just a little room for improvement which seems to correspond with the differences I read about from the 2's to 3's. So taking the leap of faith that these will bring my setup even closer to perfection. Also the leap of faith that the wood will be beautiful! It's like waiting for a child to be born - I'm sure to love it no matter what it looks like, but I'm hoping it looks good!
 
I've also got a SPC Norse Skuld 8 that I've been waiting on a couple months now...Norse has had some problems/delays as of late so hopefully that will come soon to finish tying the kit together. 
 
The setup is Jriver ASIO > Audio-GD SA-1.32 DAC > DH Labs Revelation silver RCA > Audio-GD SA-31 Amp > //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. I also have a DACmini CX that works well in the DAC portion of the chain. Probably one of the DAC's will have to go to help offset the LCD-3 upgrade.......but hopefully the end result is....

//MARK\\LCD3 Burn-In Results:
 
I haven't chimed in for a while. Way back in this thread (a few weeks ago in real time), I had just received my //MARK\\LCD3s. I was auditioning a well used pair of 2.2s and was concerned because they sounded way better than the new 3s. The folks at Audeze said it's just a matter of personal preference... and some on this thread said the 3s sounded better than the 2.2s right out of the box. Well, since that didn't happen for me, I decided to do the thing I always do: burn in any new gear before final judgement. So, I fed them a varied stream of tunes 24/7 at a decent SPL, and burned them in for 200+ hours. OMG. They've transformed. I've never heard anything like this. These cans now blow away anything I've ever auditioned, even my own Stax from years ago. Now I have to re-listen to every album I have, because it's a whole new experience! What a great decision it was to splurge for these. 
 
For those of you who are initially underwhelmed by the sound of the //MARK\\LCD3, burn them in and they will change your world.
 
Thanks to everyone on this thread for your enthusiastic recommendation.

An experiment to help you decide about burn in.
The Grobe--
As has been stated already, if you're enjoying them right out of the box, just keep listening (a lot) and they'll burn in gradually, which for some, makes the differences a little harder to notice. But if you'd like to do a fun experiment.... I have a suggestion that for me, is part of the adventure and fun of our shared hobby. Forget consensus, only your ears count.
Since I seem to be the only one on this thread who experienced a dramatic transformation in SQ by burning in my //MARK\\LCD3s (as well as my tube electronics, cables, phono cartridges, for that matter), I'll jump in again. I don't take it personally when fellow enthusiasts state "there are no measurements that prove burn in is real!" Well, until you experience something, you can't know it. Maybe we just haven't come up with a way to quantify these subtleties.
When I first got //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3s, they simply could not compete with a well used pair of //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2.2s... I did side by side tests right out of the box and there was no contest. It's not that they weren't enjoyable to listen to, it's just that they didn't sound nearly as good as their fully burned in predecessor, the 2.2s.
After over a hundred hours of 24/7 signal going through the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3s, they totally came to life. Even at this fairly early point in their burn in period, nothing I've ever had on my ears comes close to what these babies put out musically. I can't get enough of them. Really.
So, the experiment is simple: those of you with new //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3s could listen to a reference track a few times when you first get them (I recommend something you know very very well) and don't listen to that track again until 100 hours. Depending on your aural memory, by listening to the same tune again at 100, 200, and 300 hours or more, you will likely have a revelation. 
Have fun!

There are actually since love is a chemical release like all emotion.  But on topic.
 
Audio memory is crap.  If you want to do this burn in test, take notes detailing what you hear.
 
To save you some time.  Orthos aren't rigid dynamic speaker drivers, they don't loosen up like the cone of a speaker.  The pads get somewhat more pliable but not off the head.  Even in electronics, burn in, is really just coming up to temp.  So while electronics benefit from being on long enough to come up to temp, headphones aren't affected by in use time.  Which is good because if either could change significantly over such a short period of time, they'd be completely wrecked within months ;)
 
To be fair, I used to burn in headphones when I was more of a speaker guy.  Electronics I never turn off so you could say I burn them in but it's about keeping them stable not cycling devices to condition them.

If you feel that Love is mostly a chemical release I think you're probably missing something big here. But as you say, back to the topic.  
 
If Burn-In was not applicable to Planer Magnetic HPs (which is the opposite of my experience), why does Audeze themselves burn In their phones off the head for at least 50hours before letting them out the door? To test if they work for 50 hours? They could figure that out in one hour since there are hardly any moving parts. Or maybe they need 50 hours to come up to temp...? Unlikely. Or maybe, just maybe, they do it because it makes their products sound better when their customers first get them?
 
Just to make sure I wasn't the only one who has this experience, I asked industry veteran Ethan Wood from the Cable Company, where I purchased my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s. He sells, auditions and loans out hundreds of HPs a year and he said flat out that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s will benefit dramatically from up to 400 hours of burn-in. Well, maybe I'm not so crazy after all.
 
I do agree with you that taking careful and detailed notes during the experiment I suggested for "thegrobe," would be important... but my aural memory is not "crap" and I doubt yours is either. Maybe you need some burn in to relax a bit.

Just a quick note to introduce myself, a VERY happy new owner of a pair of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s! I previously owned the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2.2s and have to echo the thoughts of many other members in saying the 3s are definitely worth the extra $.  They simply take everything the 2s do well and do it better. Absolutely breathtaking wood finish (you have to see it to appreciate it) and the ear pads are incredibly more comfortable than the 2s.
 
Currently feeding them with Jriver Mediacenter ASIO --> Schitt Bifrost UBER Gen2 USB --> Schitt Lyr (stock tubes) --> Moon Audio Silver Dragon V3 cable --> //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.
 
I welcome any input on where I should start with regard to source upgrades, have been eyeballing the Schitt Mjolnir/Gungnir combo but I would like to be sure that other options in roughly the same price range shouldn't be considered.  I live in Alaska and as such cannot audition any of these products without purchase, and the cost of shipping is prohibitive in and out of the state.
 
Thanks in advance!

you are not exactly "suffering", that is a certainty.
 
i have both. the other day i was listening to a hires needledrop of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra that is one of my best recordings sonically (not to mention that it's also a phenominal(sp) performance of an amazing work). i switched just for fun from my //MARK\\hd800s to my //MARK\\lcd3s and was blown away by the sonic presentation. fantastic soundstage (via a burson) that is certainly surpassed in size by the //MARK\\800s; but fantastic stage and imaging nonetheless. the thing that caught my ear was that the tone of horns was actually truer to what I hear in a live performance in a great hall such as Carnegie. more sonorous/richer than that of the //MARK\\hd800s. switching back to the //MARK\\hd800 they didn't let me down, but I now find myself inclined to not simply default to the senns for classical. and I could easily live with just the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s. the //MARK\\800's may be a cleaner, more neutral view of the recording studio, but they do not always provide the most musical sound of each instrument. there are plusses and minuses to that more surgical viewpoint provided by the //MARK\\hd800s. i would find it far easier to give them up than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s.

Exactly. I still miss the intimacy and the finer details that headphones gave me. However, I guess I'm just the speaker type. Currently sporting floorstanding omni room fillers but might get monitors as well just because these room fillers... are loud... Loud enough that I feel uncomfortable listening to them after 6PM since all 5-6 neighbors in my condo probably hear me if I leave my veranda door open (which I have to because it's way too hot in Vancouver right now). 
 

 
 
The intimacy is the whole reason I shied away from IEMs and eventually headphones too because it was way too intimate for me. I like my music ambient as I don't do detailed listening seshs because I can't afford to do that. Also, speakers just create an atmosphere, which headphones and CIEMS will never do. This atmosphere is why I prefer speakers infinitely more than headphones or IEMs. Turning on Norah Jones just creates that undeniable mood in the room. Lastly, turning on some classical, the imaging is so 3D with speakers, if I close my eyes and adjust the volume, it really just feels like I'm in the seats of a performance, and this goes for any kind of music as well. We're all different, and I understand some just prefer headphones to speakers.

It really depends on the sound you're looking for. I've had everything schiit for quite a while so I'm pretty well versed in what they can offer for my lcd-3s. First off, be careful with the gungnir/mjolnir combo if you have any sensitivity to high frequencies. Its a very aggressive sounding amp that can sound unbelievably good at times or very overbearing at others depending on what you're throwing at it. What I've concluded is that the gungnir is a major upgrade over the regular bifrost (i have not heard uber). For me the sound of the gungnir > lyr with high quailty tubes > upgraded cables (power and headphone) > //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 is the better combo to my ears than the balanced stack. You could always try the mjolnir and return if you don't like it. Gungnir is definitely a keeper in that price range and a serious upgrade over the entry level stuff.

1. Can't comment.
2. It depends on the point of reference from which it's being described. Coming from //MARK\\HD800s, sure it is darker, but there are darker phones. I do not believe anyone can tell you if it's dark or not since that depends on what your ears are used to ("neutral" is also subjective). However, to me, they sound pretty natural, nothing that tells me they are dark or bright.
3. They excel with many genres, but I prefer Audezes for their exceptional performance with jazz, vocals, piano, and rock.
4. This is entirely subjective since some have better ability to hear than others. I can hear differences among cables, but I can't tell you if they are actually improvements or not. My ears found some cables more favourable than others, but that's as far as I can go before kiddies come at me with torches. The only way you'll find an actual answer to this question is to try cables yourself. Do note that while many kiddies say it's all placebo if you do hear something, remember that if it works for your brain, it is working**.

Unless they are selling the LF for under $1K you have better options for less money.
 
 
1. We are planning to use the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s with a Woo WA7, any comments on the sound quality of the pair?  is there an agreed upon "best" amp?
 
GS-X mk2 is pretty much the consensus for best for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and //MARK\\HD800.  In the WA7 range there is also the Burson Soloist and Schiit Mjolnir new, HeadAmp GS-1 and Bryston BHA-1 used.
 
2. Im reading of "darkness" as a description of the headphones, darkness meaning less bright?
 
Not dark.
 
3. With music such as quartet, instrumental, jazz, vocals, (no rock) cello, piano, etc.  Do these phones warrant the price?
 
Without rock genres the //MARK\\HD800 maybe a better choice.  It's shortcomings don't stand out in the genres listed.  Not to say people don't prefer the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 everywhere regardless but an //MARK\\HD800 imported from Germany will run you around $1250 to your door so it should be considered.
 
4. Anyone find improvements with wire upgrades?
 
Yes.  The Q style is lighter and more flexible than stock.  Any changes in sound will depend on the system.  For example with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 I preferred the stock cable to the Moon Silver Dragon.  The stock was less grainy and rounder.  SD was slightly more extended but grainy so... stock.  Love the Q though.

This is hyperbole... If it's actually that much noticeable, as much as switching transducers, I'm truly in envy of your ears... Seriously.

 
 
Don't expect anything. As I always say, we all hear differently, some have more sensitive ears than others so some may hear improvements, some won't. Depending on the USB implementation, results may vary. The only way to know whether it makes a noticeable difference or not is to hear it for yourself. If you can't, then you must assess the risk, and be able to justify the price tag of one. My Audiophilleo1 is $1000 and I hear a subtle improvement, but it's something I would not pay $1000 for; I can definitely live without it. However, some CAN justify the price and some CAN'T live without it, so YMMV.
 
I would honestly just go for a M2Tech Hiface Two with special drivers instead... So much cheaper and easier to use.

4W standard version also has the "benefit" of the stepped attenuator as well. I put that in quotations as some people, such as myself, actually find that to be a disadvantage due to the nature of stepped attenuators making a popping sound whenever you change volume, which I found extremely annoying. I'm a shuffle play listener most of the time and thus am forced to change my volume quite often as tracks are mastered at different volume levels.  Stepped attenuators on paper do have superior channel matching though and supposedly sounds better, so I suppose it depends on what you value more.. but I find the Alps pot to be fine on most amps.
 
Not a Conductor nor am I an owner of a //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 but I feel that my Soloist SL (same amp as those Conductor SL's) drives my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2's very well FWIW. Find it to be more than good enough.

Apologies if I'm going to sound like a cliched noob but I don't post often and I just bought  the //MARK\\LCD3 (serial 2615XXX's) and they are worth every cent.
 
I've had the //MARK\\LCD2 R1's for a couple of years now, they are late revision 1's just before the R2's came out, so I thought I had a reasonable pair as the treble was steadily improved upon over time.
 
Initially when A/B'ing I didn't immediately hear major differences, its the Ortho sound sure, just like the //MARK\\Abyss, but what did I just pay over 2k for? As I continued  I realised what the '3' designation really means.  I noticed how the //MARK\\LCD2 r1's bass was clearly darker, less articulate, and not as refined, and the mids, especially vocals were quite recessed in comparison to the //MARK\\LCD3, the super highs were not as detailed, and almost smeared.
 
It's amazing as I think the //MARK\\LCD2 r1 has a fantastic mid range but the //MARK\\LCD3 really lifts any vocal and plonks it right there in the mix where it should be. The mids are even more delicious and detailed. The bass is just completely on another level to the //MARK\\LCD2 r1 in pure quality. It's more present mostly because you notice the quality has taken a step up or two. It's smoother, goes deeper but the whole thing is very sublime and controlled in a way that results in an almost a profound presentation. I really do marvel at it.
 
There's this other thing about the //MARK\\LCD2 r1 presentation that seems to sound like some of the rear channels are creeping into the mix, almost like a cheap reverb of frequencies going on. I'm sure this is akin to the waterfall plot differences you see between the cans is what I'm hearing but who knows?? The //MARK\\LCD3 never lets me hear this phenomenon because it's not there and the sheer yumminess being thrown at you wouldn't give you time to think about it anyway.
 
//MARK\\LCD3 beats you with its happy stick over and over again, and no you can't get enough. I think they can still improve on articulating the highs, they are almost there, the //MARK\\Abyss I thought beat the LCD3's, the highs on the //MARK\\Abyss are palpable in their detail.
 
I'm still keeping my //MARK\\LCD2's r1 because they are like an old school piece of kit that you go back to for nostalgia and have grown so accustomed to, like a Holga camera maybe! A classic.

I use them fully balanced. I will try them SE on the lyr tonight but I don't think it will make a difference. I forget who it was, but someone with 1000s of posts on here said earlier this spring that he only uses an //MARK\\hd800 now because the center imaging was so troubling to him. its funny because when i first got them, i didnt notice anything of the sort. I'm also a little worried that it has something to do with my left ear (maybe some pushed in wax) so i need to see an ear doctor to ease my mind. Or, I may just send them to audeze for a check-up.
 
Im actually so annoyed by the whole situation that I'm thinking of moving on to a nice 2-channel speaker setup and never looking back. Im sitting there trying to enjoy an album, but every 30 seconds Im thinking "the right channel sounds louder....no wait its fine....wait idk...wait did that bass drop sound more prominant from the right?.....yes it did....oh heres a good riff out the left channel we're good now...ah i cant be sure this f'n sucks". Then I take em off and cry myself to sleep.

Who said there wasn't anything wrong with having multiple cars :P  
 
When I was young and racing on weekends I still made sure that the car could do everything else as well.  Just like in audio I'd rather have one great $60K car than three $20K cars... just saying.  It's especially dumb when people are bankrupting themselves to over reach on their hobby.  Now if you are making money hand over fist and no debt whether it be a mortgage, car or student loan... go nuts.  I still have a little under a decade left on my mortgage and would rather clear it to minimize interest, interest being money you never see again that you could have spent on that car or audio instead of handing it to the bank, than have several cars or stereo rigs.
 
Using DG as an example.  She has $7000 in headphones and another $2400 in amps.  Could have a 009/BHSE rig and $500 in hand instead... just saying.

i've never heard the 009/BHSE, but wasn't too blown away by the //MARK\\SR-//MARK\\009 and LL, sure the //MARK\\SR-//MARK\\009 is much much better than any of my headphones, but it wouldn't necessarily always provide musical enjoyment. i'd be missing the colorations that some of my headphones provide, like the deep bass and smoothness of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and the fun sound of the //MARK\\TH-//MARK\\900, so its not a just 1 headphone solution. unless of course i did something like MH did and ended up with dynamic + stats, but still, i don't think i would do that.
 
btw, i never realized that all my headphones cost that much together, would be almost 9k if i kept the //MARK\\PS1000 
 
i'm done with headphones though, might re-buy //MARK\\Grado //MARK\\RS1i (or not, since i feel the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and //MARK\\T1 provide the same qualities they have, but different and better overall) and already committed to buying a used //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 on the FS/FT for when i get the GSX-2.
 

 
yes!! 
 
also im buying an //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 as well.

Oh man, don't get me started on DAC research... 
 
At the moment, the ones I'm considering on my list, in no particular order, with a brief summary of my thoughts are:
- AGD M7. Great value in terms of technical specs vs cost. Concerning 'boringness' of music based on a handful of personal reviews - not the end of the world though, some equalizer settings may mitigate this since I'm going to driving my DAC from PC.
- Eximus DP1. Great personal reviews on headfi re immersive soundstage and musicality (both are things I really like considering I have a WA2 atm). Technical specs aren't as good as AGD M7 and has a headphone amp that I don't want/need. Think the line out goes through a discrete preamp circuit too... but not sure. Regardless, musical prowess trumps all I guess...
- Metrum Hex/Resonance Mirrus. Pretty much out of my price range, but I like to dream... they seem to have the technical specs and musicality I desire.
- Bryston BDA-2. MacedonianHero is hyping it out of this world and I value his judgement >< Technically less superior compared to AGD M7 though. 
- Schitt Yoggdrasil - waiting to see what their flagship DAC will be like, but it may be a long wait...
- W4S Dac 2 DSD SE. Technically seems to equivalent to the AGD M7 in terms of USB implementation (e.g. galvanic isolation of USB input whereas AGD M7 doesn't rely on power from USB input at all). Haven't really followed up on this one compared to the others though...
 
Given my E. Eng. background I like to make sure I'm getting value for money when it comes to what I'm buying - hence me harping on about 'technical specs' above. I like to know my money is going to a good PSU, good USB implemntation, multiple parallel DAC chips per channel, etc. But sometimes, like the Eximus DP1, Bryston BDA-2, other user reviews trump that stuff and it's really just about how good it sounds :P 
 
ARRRG, glad I don't have the funds till January so I can mull on this much longer...
 
Which ones are you looking at?

- the agd m7 is definitely very hyped up right now, but im not sure about the product quality (i heard their usb port is loose on all their dacs for example).
- same feeling for the eximus dp1, i dont need/want the headphone amp
- bryston bda-2, looks to have all the features that i want (especially like 2x toslink input). only (minor) thing against it is its a bit wide and won't fit on my desk lol
- same thing goes for the statement schiit. but judging by what we know so far, i probably would go for the bryston as it has 2x toslink and both have the wide footprint. of course assuming SQ is similar. too bad the long wait :(
- w4s dac 2 looks very good, has pretty much everything i need
 
i've also looked at:
- perfectwave pwd mk2, looks to be pretty full featured, but lately a lot of ppl are selling it off not sure why (firmware issues?). and tbh i dont rly care much for pretty lcd touch screen, i just need to feed digital data in and get good sound out
- nad m51, seems to be a good dac but also has features that i dont need (hdmi bypass for example, which has its own issues actually)
 
i just want a dac that has a good clean power section, good input implementation (i mostly use toslink which is guaranteed galvanically isolated anyway), and truly balanced design (not SE phase split). stuff like DSD, pretty screen, filters, i dont really care for. builtin headphone amp and volume control are also things i dont rly need/want.
 
right now im kinda leaning towards the w4s dac 2.

Ha, tough question to answer really because before I hit up a few meets and heard some more expensive amps - the LG was the most enjoyable amp I'd heard. The GS-X mk2 was just better in almost every way and with all my headphones but the //MARK\\HD800. I still enjoy the //MARK\\HD800's the most with a good tube amp. I'm hoping the Stratus is a step up. I miss my GS-X mk2 + //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 already, and it has only been gone a day. Truly the best I've heard the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.. 
 
The main reason I got rid of the LG was actually the main reason I bought it in the first place. I loved the idea of tube rolling, but I just don't have the disposable income or patience to deal with finding the "right/best" tube for each headphone I own. I also found the amp to be not used as much once I got the GS-X. Like I said, the only time I was using the LG was when I listened to the //MARK\\HD800, and that is my least used headphone..

Interesting comments here-like a decision has been made and no possible other rig could possibly change perceptions. I'd hate to be that closed-minded personally-the fun is in both the journey and the destination. I need to try and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 sometime, and see what the fuss is about. The problem for me personally, is that for every couple of people who claim a large jump from the 2.2s to the 3s, there are many more who claim said jump is negligible. If the latter is the case (for me anyway), I'd see no need nor desire to try the 3s. Reason being is I've heard the 2.2s on what is by many considered one of their best amp mates, the Bryston BHA-1. They sounded great to me on this rig. OTOH, the //MARK\\HD800s on this same exact setup, which is a much less than ideal amp for the Senns imo, sounded better than the LCD 2.2s in all areas. So, the LCD's "ceiling", if you will, didn't even reach the //MARK\\HD800's level on a less than ideal setup.
 
I'm willing to bet between the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 and //MARK\\HD800-the one that "kicks the others @$$", is really the one that is able to scale higher than the other with better equipment. OTOH, as Solude seems to be proving-subjective approval overrides all-and a heavy bias will only accentuate that. 
 
I'll be sure to snag an //MARK\\LCD3 once my Leviathan arrives-and see which one seems to have the higher ceiling.

Who are 'people'? I would bet without analyzing that more people are buying //MARK\\LCD3s than selling.
 
I listened for a short time to the //MARK\\800 at a Senn booth for about 10 minutes. I found them dry & non-engaging. I went back to the Audeze booth  listened for a few minutes and back to the //MARK\\800 for just a minute to confirm my opinion. To be fair, the comfort factor without a doubt goes to the //MARK\\800 big time.
 
My rig with //MARK\\LCD3's are the best sound I have ever had, speakers included. Now, at the same show I listened to a $100,000 system of which the speakers were like 70Gs of the total......THAT was the best sound I ever heard but would never purchase.
 
In the headphone arena, with the right pieces.......I bet the //MARK\\800s would sound good, probably as good as the //MARK\\LCD3s.......neither one is kicking each other's ass all things being equal.

Can you rewrite this in a way that I might have an idea as to what you are trying to say?
 
It's cute that you think the Leviathan is auto win before putting hands on it :P
 
If you are trying to say I have a bias towards Audeze you need to look for my name in the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 thread.  I was critical of them for a long long time on performance, design, comfort, price, qc...  In the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 thread I pegged the jump to //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 as under 10% quality increase, I believe I called it a side grade.  Turns out it was likely my W4S DAC-2 and AMB B22 since the Metrum Octave, PS PWD2 and Apex Peak pulled them up while doing next to nothing for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2.  Later replaced the Peak with the Soloist and now GS-X mk2.
 
I'd still love to try an EC AC DHT, some Audio-GD gear, recent HiFiMAN orthos and custom IEMs that I could use on both home and portable rigs but frankly at this point I just can't really point to anything in the reprod of music that I would change and spending big money to listen to music with traffic noise in the background seems kind of pointless.

For someone who has bought and sold both //MARK\\HD800 and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 numerous times which he has explained was due to the new amps/DACs that he has changed. What make you so sure that NO system can make you prefer the //MARK\\HD800 once AGAIN over the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3? I have previously quoted you saying that you preferred the //MARK\\HD800 over the LCDs by a LANDSLIDE and based on the what I read from others' comments, that pretty much sums up the impression you gave me and the others that you really enjoyed the //MARK\\HD800 very much during that period, rather than just a pair "listenable" of headphones. And I certainly do not agree at all that saying something you can live with is considered an compliment! (Get off the high chair, man!) Try telling that to your wife "You are someone I can live with, and that is a actually a compliment", and see how she will react to that, or imagine someone tell you that, how would you feel? I will be very surprise if you still think that that statement is a compliment.

No axe-grinding here-I'm just curious about the scalability of both of these flagships personally. I think the //MARK\\HD800 has the higher ceiling, and I think Solude has experienced the chameleon-esque character of both these flagships. I can relate-as I too have owned the //MARK\\HD800 three different times now. It's a pesky sucker-hard to nail down in a system ime. I have heard it sound 'good' on a number of amps-but I've only heard it sound 'great' on...1. Actually for those on a budget-I'd argue it sounds great on the m-Stage, seeing as that's one of a few ss amps that mates well with it, at bargain bin pricing no less.
 
The Audezes seem to be much less picky about amplification-such it their nature. That in no means suggest they can't scale pretty high, but I'd be surprised if anything could best the Senn on a no holds barred budget. Even then, they'd still require system synergy more than any other cans imo.
 
OT-how do the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3s compare to the //MARK\\HD800 in terms of accurate imaging and soundstaging? The 2.2s sucked in this regard, but I've heard the 3s are much better. Do they at least come within spitting distance of the Senns?

See I don't hear it that way and the scope certainly disagrees.  They are quite transparent, but also quite slow and overdamped compared to other top flight headphones.  Tonal balance isn't neutral either, the open baffle really rolls the bottom and the raised treble shelf make for a headphone that performs best with mid-centric material.  Which depending on your genre preference might not even matter but you can't have an M frequency response and be neutral.  It's a case of getting better resolution on what you do hear because other things are missing giving you less to process overall.  That's been my take away the three times I owned it.  
 
The GS-X mk2 though really filled in the bottom to something usable.  The shelf though is a two sided edge, on one hand it sits in the definition range so instrument detail and focus go up, on the other any primaries or secondaries in the range also get brought up messing up the instrument balance.  Simple example is often in rock/metal genres the hats or ride live in there and become the overriding drive of the tune.  But like I said, it's fairly easy to zero out.  The bass you can't really do anything about because it's already starting to distort at unaltered levels so a bump would only drive it into the 10%+ THD range.
 
This I believe is why some like it on OTL or vintage amps with high output impedance.  It corrects for some of the faults by changing the freq resp in a positive way and lowers the damping to something less fixed.  Your ZDSE doesn't count since it has near SS output impedance.
 
And I can live with that.  Imagine what I think of the can't live with list ;)

I agreed about the transparency of the //MARK\\HD800 =)
 
The GS-X mk2 has a slightly different power supply than the earlier GS-X, uses different parts but the same circuit in the amp, and cranks both rail voltage and bias.  Earlier Dynalo amps could be considered wire with gain or dry depending on your point of view.  The mk2 I believe benefits from the power supply speed and higher bias to simply never run out of steam down low.  It's not that the bass is elevated so much that it's deep and propulsive.  Greater dynamic range than the typical sucked out compressed sound most solid state suffers from.  None of my tube amps suffered from compression, some were rolled but never compressed.
 
//MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 staging is better than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 but not //MARK\\HD800 level.  On the GS-X mk2 I get some shoulder check moments and image placement is precise but it's no //MARK\\HD800 in that regard.  Nothing is.
 
As for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 changing on rigs.  The first time out I had the W4S DAC-2 and rolled seven or so amps.  They all sounded different.  A bunch could have been stand ins for each other in a pinch and three stood out.  The B22 was leading the pack until the Peak came in and with the Hytron or Sylvania just stomped all over the B22.  No compression, more focused images, higher resolution, all that tube goodness.  The Soloist was better than the B22, more focused, better clarity, better bottom but compressed beside the Peak.  Good as it was there was still this something that bugged me about the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 didn't exhibit.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it though.  //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and Peak went bye bye, Soloist and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 back in.
 
I now believe it was the W4S because on the PWD2 I don't get that feeling.  Unfortunately I don't have another source worth trying to see if the GS-X mk2 tracks the change or still delivers the goods.  I have considered the new Bryston BDA-2 to save some desktop real-estate or in a pinch I suppose I could hook up my portable or theatre player.

Thanks for those impressions. I like how you mentioned the somewhat compressed sound of most ss amps. That's one area where it seems nothing could touch my old ZDSE-the dynamics from low to high were simply outstanding. The micro dynamics are outstanding. It almost feels like most other amps I've have simply don't have the dynamic range of the EC-even the WA5LE doesn't-but I partly blame that on a noise floor that isn't as astonishingly low (for tubes) as the ZDSE. Coupled with the gigantic, holographic soundstage, along with the microdetails and microdynamics-I don't really get a taste of that from many other amps. The BHA-1 had a hint of it-just enough for me to notice-which is why I liked that amp even though it wasn't the best with the Senn. If the GSXii can come close in those areas, I'll have to pull the trigger sooner, rather than later. Which reminds me, I've got some listening to do on the P1u...

yes. the reason so many of us swear that they are worth their price is that they are indeed on a similar level (as the //MARK\\hd800). i sold the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2 because it was not on that level, while i found the //MARK\\beyer //MARK\\t1 was (is) in many ways (soundstage not so much, but imaging is very fine indeed).  the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 has the "meat on the bones" sonic leanings of the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2 but to my ear is simply way more refined - with far greater imaging and soundstage. even for large scale classical they sound great until i swap out to the //MARK\\hd800 and then that huge stage takes the cake. i could live with the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 as a sole headphone although i'd miss the //MARK\\hd800. the reverse is not true. there are rock recordings for which the //MARK\\hd800's transparency doesn't make up for a certain lack of weight in the sound. for me it's similar to two different types of speakers that i enjoy having around: a jbl or time window for some more slamming  rock (or what have you) and a kef 105.2 for finesse/delicasy/transparency/refinement. There are times when the kef105.2's dont slam enough (led zep I and II for instance). but there are times when their refinements support the music amazingly well (symphonic classical, abbey road, tea for the tillerman, bill evans).  to my ear EVERYTHING sounds good on the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, but now and then a recording will benefit from the more "open" (ie transparency combined with broader staging/imaging) that the //MARK\\hd800 delivers. also - there are some recordings for which the //MARK\\800s to my ear seem to exhibit a weird voicing; almost artificial sounding. and they are always more analytical. there are people here who wrote them off pointing to one or the other of those two attributes; but i find that they are not so analytical as to be antiseptic and that the "artificial" presentation is a rare occurance. then again I NEVER think the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 sounds anything but natural. it brings out the organic elements in recordings i've been hearing for 40 to 50 years more consistantly than any headphone or speaker i've ever used. yet delivers the detail and imaging that make me proclaim them to be on that highest level of refinement/finesse. my suggestion is to own both. if the //MARK\\800s dont cut it for you they are easily resold. but there is no way that the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3s won't cut it except if you listen to classical strictly or somethin'. these are both KILLER instruments of music delivery, people. but listening/enjoying music is SO subjective that only you will be able to decide for yourself what the nuances delivered by either set of headphones adds up to for you and your collection.

wow huge discussion.
 
umm i think i prefer //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 on GSX MK2 to the ZD by a good margin, it really is that much better, though its also different. i can finally see why people say the //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 scales so much and takes on an electrostatic kinda sound to them, nothing i've heard yet has done that before this. i still love my //MARK\\hd //MARK\\800 out of WA2 though (or ZD with those 6SL7 sophia tubes), but its a different kinda sound, smoother and warmer, but not as transparent or detailed or whatever out of GSX, u know, that wire with gain?
 
now umm, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 scale alot as well, and even the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500 (like WTF, they sound incredible with GSX MK2, i already though they where pretty damn good with WA6-SE, and when i upgraded my dac, i saw the most improvement with these).
 
the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 do have better imaging/soundstage than //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2, by a noticeable amount, but the biggest difference i noticed now with the GSX is that  i can finally agree with Macedonianhero when he claimed the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 to have equal soundstage/imaging to the //MARK\\Beyerdynamic //MARK\\T1, it really did get much much better than what i've heard before with my WA6-SE.
 
i wish //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 had as much bass as //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2r2. its slightly less in impact, but everything else on //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is better. (and //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 i see has the bass i want), its funny how with //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, when i would use //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2, it was for the bass, now i use the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 for the warmth and smoothness, i might even get //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 again if i end up with some extra money laying around.

WOW this thread sure did get going pretty fast.  
 
The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 sure does have more meat on it's bones when compared to the //MARK\\HD800s.  It's just sometimes it has too much meat - at times..
 
I've also seen where someone said the //MARK\\HD800s scale higher that any other headphone?  I don't find that to tbe the case.  It does scale fairly high that's for sure.  However, compared to the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, no other headphone I've heard has the ability to scale like it does.  The //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 has "NO CELLING" IMO.  The //MARK\\Abyss is a possibility, have not heard it yet.  The //MARK\\009s can't scale as high as the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 from what I've heard.  Although the //MARK\\009s does some things better, the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 also does things better.
 
I'm also starting to like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s more and more. I'm finding the //MARK\\HD800s to be limited, while the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s becoming more of a jack of all trades - still not as flexible as the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6.
 
The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s & //MARK\\HD800s are not for all music that's for sure.  With the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 I find I can listen to "ALL" music with.  Yes - the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and the //MARK\\HD800s are better at some things.  But the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 are better at "most" things IMO.
 
If I was to scale down to a one amp, one DAC, one headphone system a la Soulde.  It would be the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 / F1J / DAC???  The GS-X mk2 would be up for sale in a heart beat.  I just find the GS-X mk2 to be one of the best all around amps out there to be used with multiple headphones.

Flawed at best?  No.  Not at all not from my point of view.  
 
Simply put the //MARK\\HD800 can not keep up with the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 as the amplification goes up.  Simple as that.  If you can't understand that.  I suggest you get some hands on experience on this subject, then come back and report your findings.
 
"I mean if I want to make a pair of headphones scale higher, I will find one that specifically drive it better"
As I said.  From what I've owned, borrowed and auditioned.   So go-ahead and find one that does.  Please report back.
 
"The same argument can be said for //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, if I go from a O2 amp to Woo WA2 on the //MARK\\HD800, the //MARK\\HD800 will probably scale much higher compared to HE-6 on the same sets of amplifiers,"
No, just no.sorry bad analogy.  You said probably     The //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 will continue to have the higher celling.

I think I also find it hard to understand the scaling concept. It wuld absolutely mean nothing if we are not comparing the absolute performance of these pairings but it may not be possible.
I may be able to agree with "scaling" IF say we can have an absolute performance scale and the //MARK\\HE6 score 100/100 when paired with the best speaker amp for it vs the //MARK\\hd800///MARK\\lcd3 score only 80/100 when paired with the best headphone amp for them respectively. But in reality this isn't really easy or possible to score them in absolute.
However, I actually prefers headphones that can achieve better absolute performance with "lesser" upstream gears. For example if I can achieve the same 80/100 performance for //MARK\\lcd3 with a 1k amp vs 90/1000 for //MARK\\hd800 with a 5k amp, of course I prefer the //MARK\\lcd3.
At the end of the day these "absolute" performance isn't really quantifiable and it really just come down to preference and priorities. E.g. if I am an amp enthusiast I may actually like a more challenging to pair headphone just for the sake of the pleasure it gave me to try different amps.....

I'm going to get to hear a friend' s  (zare) with the latest batch. When he gets it, we'll have another mini-meet. As well, price tag doesn't correlate to performance.

Someone's *****-footin' here. 
 
Not only is it apples and oranges-it completely lacks proper perspective imo. There are THOUSANDS more speaker amps than headphone amps-and the speaker amps can go to the moon as far as pricing. It's easy to say that the //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 can scale higher than anything else-when it's the only one that is so blatanty ineffeicient to require stepping into that realm. I guess we should have Audeze and Senn make their next flagship around 80 dB/mw and add speaker taps so they have the potential to sound better.
 
One another note-not one person here can claim they've heard ANY headphone dynamic or otherwise-reach it's ceiling-being as there are too many variables, and unobtanium sources out there to be able to claim that with any authority. The Stax guys probably come closest-but that's just because they have like 5 amps to choose from. ;P
 
In the end-it's all subjective anyway.

Another bit of O/T
 
I've heard all the 3 amps in the discussion the BHSE, WES and the KGSSHV (minus mine that is being built). I don't fanboy for either side but I tend to like to know a bit about the amp (technical perspectives including spec, parts used and a brief about the circuitry design but I'm no EE) apart from it's sound. At one stage I use to think the Wes and A10 was well regarded I was proven wrong by words and that early opinion I had was proven wrong after hearing the latter for myself.
 
I had limited time with the BHSE and 009 pairing so take things with a grain.
 
In terms of build quality, both the BHSE and WES will get a 10/10 from me. KGSSHV is not a commercial build it is DIY, with DIY the skies literally the limit.
 
BHSE + //MARK\\009, bit bright for my taste but very unbelievable sounding, I'm sure  I would've picked more flaws out of the combo if I had more than 40 minutes to play around with things so my brain can adjust itself and nullify bias, placebo etc.
 
WES + //MARK\\009 is a nice pairing as it adds bit more meat onto the //MARK\\009's sound but the extension doesn't come of as clean sounding, I'm sorry but extension onto all sound aspects of an electrostat including one such as the //MARK\\009 is one thing it must deliver cleanly when paired up with the amplifier it is being powered from, otherwise the sound is no different to your general ortho and dynamic headphone. To be able to deliver the sound, extended audibly clean and nice, separation of the different sound aspects.
 
KGSSHV + //MARK\\009 is a cleaner sounding WES with no extension fuzziness.
 
But I still prefer my //MARK\\Omega's over the //MARK\\009 because it was the most expensive stat I've owned. hehe.
 
Now all we need is somebody put //MARK\\009 transducers into the //MARK\\LCD3's.

Well apparently we're talking about systems like the integrated amp by Odyssey... Yeah, I figure it would fit, Audeze and Odyssey :)
 
But seriously?
 
When I'll buy the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's I'll have big problems with choosing the right amp, why? Cause this poor country called Israel don't have anything, Audeze came here just recently. I don't like buying before trying. You don't have a system here where you can "borrow" something and then if you don't like it, give it back within whatever time frame they are giving you, no... It's all about - if you opened it, it's yours!
 
I've heard wherever I'm moving, germany, in EU they've got that system where no matter if you don't like it, you can return it within 14 days.
 
We don't have the Burson here, the closest to this we've got the Bryston BHA-1, and it's also out of stock (No demo sample) as well as very much overpriced (Google: 7990 ILS to USD). The closest I have listened to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 on a high-end system was the Leben CS-600 amp, and I doubt they've driven it well enough cause I was feeling like it lacks power a bit, though sound was still excellent.
 
There are 2 possibilities that I can see right now - Get the Audio-gd NFB-10ES2 and not mind risking a lot of money going down the drain and know that I will at least have something well reviewed + balanced output, or go for whatever other people suggested which is buy (somewhere, no idea) these speaker taps which I have no idea how they work cause nobody really knows how that works, either... and go test speaker amps until I'm satisfied.
 
Also sometimes second hand is a good idea...

Oh and countdown begins - 2 weeks and 3 days more or less and the store has the //MARK\\audeze //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's. I hope I can get a listen before I buy, though I'll still be buying.
 
The guy considers Leben CS600 as the best match for the LCD's in general. I felt some lack of power (I've heard the LCD's should give you proper bass, I didn't feel it until I used bass boost) and of course the tube sound.
 
This time around I'll be burning a CD or two (Too bad it's 16/44.1 from 24bit/96-192khz though) to test more familiar music and proper Masterings (I know they are proper cause they sound this to me).
 
The guy is looking for some good amps to join his collection which he sells, being the only distributor of Audeze, I suggested a few, he was looking at Woo Audio before, Schiit, and now he's looking at Eddie Current (At the moment he's seriously thinking about this, are these any good, say with the LCD's?). Have you people got anything you can recommend? I'll tell him.

Well, it is probably a preference thing, the fact that Solude's commented that //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 on conductor approaches PWD2/GS-X/HD800 and that //MARK\\HD800 on that rig merely makes //MARK\\HD800 listenable by his standard, seriously doesn't make that combi sound that spectacular at all. My aim is to make //MARK\\HD800 sound more organic and natural, or in other words, making //MARK\\HD800 sounds a bit more more Audeze. I ordered the GS-X MkII, then some of you started speculating how close M8 could sound next to GS-X. Yes, you mentioned at that point that I may not like GS-X at all and you could be right. The M7/M8///MARK\\HD800 is not the sound I want, and gathering from all your comments, GS-X///MARK\\HD800 could possibly produce similar sound with just greater transparency and dynamism. That was why I pulled the plug on GS-X and just received my refund from Justin last week.
Anyway, I always wonder given how different //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and //MARK\\HD800 sound, how can the same set of DAC and amplifiers produce optimal sound for both headphones? Even on a equally versatile amplifier DNA Stratus, users have to use different sets of tubes to optimize the performance of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and //MARK\\HD800. Yes, while I have no doubt that GS-X is a very versatile amp, I don't think it is able to produce the best synergy with each and every pair of headphones.

I think a lot of the misconception regarding the GS-X mk2 being "the best" amp for both headphones, despite them being very different in presentation, is the unmentioned coupled source. A lot of what makes the GS-X mk2 special in my opinion is how it reveals your source and your headphones in tandem. I've tried the GS-X mk2 with lesser DACs such as the Bifrost, Musical Fidelity M1 DAC, and the Sabre D18 and all were combos I didn't enjoy. To me, source has quite a bit to due with the overall sound quality you get out of the GS-X mk2. Personally, the best I've heard the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 was with the PWD MKII / GS-X mk2 Combo.
 
@froger - Also, one person's "organic and natural" could vary quite a bit from your own definition of the sound. Personally, the //MARK\\HD800 with the GS-X mk2 is a very nice combination. I personally like a bit of warmth with the //MARK\\HD800, so per your quest for a organic and natural sounding //MARK\\HD800 tells me you should be looking at various tube amps. Quite a few choices out there if you expand your search to include tubes. (LG, Stratus, ECBA, etc.)

I won't be as completely dismissive of the LG like Solude was, but the reality is the GS-X mk2 is the better amp. Better bass control, treble is more refined, just more focus across the board. Everything is more precise and articulated (detailed and transparent). To some it probably will sound more realistic and natural to the track. The few things that the LG does better is dynamics and soundstaging - but this is after testing multiple tube sets ($$$) and choosing the most optimal tube for my preferences. Personally, I don't find the LG to be drastically overpriced, it is more expensive than the GS-X mk2, but it is a great amp for someone that finds tube rolling enjoyable and wants only one amp. I will say the amp has a ton of versatility being able to adapt the sound to your preferences for each individual headphone. With the right tubes, the LG paired very nicely with all of the headphones I threw at it, except the Fostex TH600/900 and Denon D7K. Both //MARK\\HD800 and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 pairings were wonderful, but as I said you need to front the cash to have it sound really good. Stock tubes are decent. but don't do any justice to what the amp truly can do (as all tube amplifiers IMO, the stock tubes are usually quite bad in comparison). Also, just to let you know the LG is not a OTL design. It is a hybrid tube amplifier that uses the selected tubes as the output buffer. This allows the amplifier to be powered by "SS" parts, while keeping the warmth of tubes for flavor. In essence it is a suped-up Schiit Lyr. Overall, I have no regrets buying the LG. It is a BEAUTIFUL amplifier which is rarely depicted accurately in photos, build quality is top notch (I would rank it a step above the GS-X mk2), and the sound is great granted you are patient while finding the right tubes. That last bit was the only reason I sold mine. I just didn't have the patience or money to be spending on tube rolling to find the right tube for every headphone that passes in and out of my stable. If you want a great amp that pairs nicely with almost everything (everything?) and none of the hassle of tubes, the GS-X mk2 is the clear choice. If you like the journey and have a blank check, the LG is a good amp and worthy of consideration. 
 
PS: For my preferences I prefer the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 with the GS-X mk2, and the //MARK\\HD800 with the LG. We shall see when the Stratus arrives if anything changes.

I agree with Solude on this one. I've only heard the WA22 from the two mentioned but it sounded great with the //MARK\\T1, which is what was available at the time. No time with the //MARK\\HD800 unfortunately, but I've owned the WA2 and in comparison, there is an upgrade - but not as much as the increase in price would lead you on to believe. I don't want to speculate on the WA5, but from reviews it seems like an amp that is worthy of consideration. Overall it's still widely known as overpriced (new). If you can land one used for a good price, I'm sure it will impress you.  You seem to really enjoy the Woo signature sound and aesthetics (beautiful amps IMO), so I don't think it will disappoint. If you really enjoy tube rolling you might want to look at ZDSE or even a regular ZD. I really love Woo, but their prices are a bit steep for the performance you get stock. You have to front half the cost of another amp (tubes) to find the sweet spot. Maybe even give a go at a used LG if you can find one. 
 
PS: I agree, rolling 2A3's or 300Bs is too costly. I'm getting one set of upgraded tubes for the Stratus before I stop this madness.

well a small upgrade would be nice with //MARK\\T1 with WA22. the //MARK\\T1/WA2 is very very close to perfect, its hard for me to find flaws, so i can imagine the improvements will be small. would be nice to have an amp that can sound just as good with //MARK\\T1 as WA2, since thats the main purpose of me buying the WA22, but also one that plays nice with //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 (which from what i've heard, the WA22 is a good upgrade from WA2 with //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800, and of course, the WA22 can also work with low impedance unlike the WA2 which is strictly a //MARK\\HD800///MARK\\T1 amp.
 
if of course the WA22 disappoints, i'll simply return to WA2 as i only mainly need it as a tube complement for //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 and as my main amp for //MARK\\T1. 
 
i'm excited to be able to roll my tubes with the WA22. i like that it uses the 5U4G rectifiers.
 
regardless of which amp i end up keeping, i'll be able to max out the tubes and get the top ones available. since i've found out woos sound the best when upgraded, when stock, they unfortunately, sometimes under-perform, the woos are made for tube rolling.

I'll have to second Dan's opinion on this one. The //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 does seem to scale higher and I'm not sure that I need my M8/Ref8 to get the most out of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. Both require approximately the same amount of power from the M8 (8-10 on low gain), but I feel that the hyperdetailed nature of the //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 calls for a cleaner power supply and a better DAC.
 
I'm starting to think that DACs may be more important than amps for all but the most budget setups. The first chain that I really liked my //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800 on was SA-1 -> Apex Arete/Volcano. I lent the SA-1 to a friend for a week and was not pleased with the DAC performance of the HUD-MX1 that I threw in to replace it (this was noticeable on //MARK\\HD //MARK\\580, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2, //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6, and //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800). The music sounded much flatter and the lows tended to blur into some sort of one note bass.
 
This is not a knock on the Audinst - it was my office unit for a long time and is quite admirable for a small budget all in one running off a wall wart. However, it cannot really compete with bulky dedicated units with overbuilt PSUs.

My comment with regards to budget DACs was to Solude's initial reply. Also I don't think it's correct to use "same price range" when MJ/Soloist vs GS-X MK2 is a roughly 300% range at these amounts. What do you consider same price range? 1-5k? I think that's immensely broad if so. The money on DACs is extremely well spent when moving from low-end to high-end. Good selection is key like with anything. Not all that costs is worthwhile etc. I would feel cheated if a certain 2000 DAC sounds substantially better than another DAC for the same money. Or the reverse... don't buy the crap one. Same with amplifiers. :)
 
The only reason I replied is that I don't agree with the importance of DACs being downplayed as one moves accross budget ranges. Exceptions obviously apply. This is my opinion of course and how I have heard it based on personal experience up to the PWD2. I can't comment past that. Yet. :)

It's a very good sounding combo, very engaging, fluid, and possessing excellent bass control. Unfortunately, my Arete/Volcano was put into storage, so I don't have anything in the same price range to compare the M8 to at the moment. I remember the Arete being a bit more forward and slightly less bassy, but it's been awhile since I've had it on my desk.
 
If you're not worried about possible warranty issues and need the power swing, remote, or preamp functions I'd recommend the M8 as an end game SS amplifer. 
 
It's insane how much hardware you get for your ~$1650. Mine drives my //MARK\\HD //MARK\\800, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, and //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 with ease and acts as a preamp for my T200b speakers. I think Kevin Gilmore mentioned earlier that he can't even buy the parts to build a M8 at the price that Kingwa sells it for, so you know you've got a value winner here. 
 
I'm sad that it doesn't seem to get the same praise that the Phoenix got when it was released, but I'm hoping this 35 pound beast eventually gets the credit it deserves. BournePerfect, you need to give this thing another chance and do a shootout against the GS-X.

I still find it quite hard to understand the preconception or reputation of dark or bassy for the //MARK\\LCD3. At least for my units in my setup the difference of the //MARK\\HD800 vs the //MARK\\LCD3 is no where close to what I had been and is reading on various threads. There are noticeable difference but at the same time I can't really understand how it would be "tiring" with the //MARK\\HD800 treble, or how the //MARK\\LCD3 treble is "shelved". These descriptions sounded way too extreme against my experience with them.
//MARK\\LCD2 I can somewhat agree with the darkness and subdued treble, but //MARK\\LCD3 is probably at the lower bound of the "the right amount of treble" for me, while the //MARK\\HD800 at the upper end. For reference I do fine //MARK\\TH900 treble too spicy, and //MARK\\LCD2 treble a bit too little. He6 I haven't spent enough time with and can't really decide if it is too bright or not. (I think it is a tad too bright out of the EF6 with my brief demo sessions in different occasions but would reserve judgement.)
But at the end of the day these are all very subjective and my point is that I would be hearing a much bigger difference between the //MARK\\LCD3 and the //MARK\\HD800 if I went by these comments, but I don't.Edited by kkcc - 10/5/13 at 10:17pm

What's your rig?
When I owned the //MARK\\HD800 and //MARK\\LCD2 and 3 with the DNA Stratus and X-Sabre, //MARK\\LCD2.2 and 3 were very close, 3 had more mid bass and had better imaging, but FR tilt was nearly identical. //MARK\\HD800 was very bright, but sounded much fuller with the Stratus. However, it was still nowhere near the FR tilt of the Audezes. It was still lacking subbass compared to the orthos, and treble was still very spicy. I remember it's being spicier than the //MARK\\TH900 for sure, even on the Stratus. In comparison, the //MARK\\LCD3 was pretty dark sounding as well, and will most likely be described as "shelved" if the person is used to a more neutral to brighter sound. //MARK\\HD800 was actually tiring to my ears as well with poorly recorded tracks, even with the Anax Mod 2.0. 
 
tl;dr - These descriptions are pretty accurate as far as my experience with them goes.

If the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X was meant to be "better" than an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, it would be more expensive than it, or they would discontinue the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 altogether. It would also more likely be called an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\4 or an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.2 etc. The fact is, they messed up their numbering, as they wanted a higher number to be a better model, in which case they should have called the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\100. This would then allow them to have a middle range with numbers like //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\10.
 
Having got themselves in a muddle with numbering, they had to calling it something different altogether like //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X. If they are intended for studio use, they might be making a mistake to normalize the treble, because I use the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s in a studio environment and the whole reason I do, is because they give the most natural timbre I have ever heard through headphones, particularly for the piano. I rejected headphones like the //MARK\\HD800 or //MARK\\Grado //MARK\\PS1000 because they were far too bright and sounded wrong to my ears altogether. On the other hand if they are used for critical mixing/re-mixing, then that could be the way to go.
 
Either way, it is fairly clear to me that Audeze are not stopping the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, they are not going to undercut a top model with a cheaper better one (that would be stupid) and that these new headphones having a specific purpose/target market in mind.

Hmm...I am not completely convinced on this. I just had the chance to try out a friend's brand new //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 (although the graph is dated July 2013). I have an August 2012 (261) pair. I was actually quite impressed with how similar they sounded, but the graph didn't make it look that way. I think something has changed with Audeze's measuring equipment or rig that is causing them to "appear" slightly different on the graph.
 
Even if you go back to August/September last year, you can see some where the graph stays flatter for longer, and others where it appears to plummet after 1K. For example, here is my graph. Although it seems to start dropping fairly early (but definitely post-veil), it stays higher for longer. I have a second graph here which starts to drop later but then plummets (231 pair but repaired for veiling).
 
I have always been worried about some kind of ageing mutation with these, and hearing my friends new pair is a great relief indeed that mine still sound as good as they are supposed to.
 
P.S A lot of the newer graphs start higher up above the 90dB line, which if you normalize, shows the difference is not quite as large as it appears on the graph either.

ETP stands for Electrolytic Tough Pitch. ETP starts out with a high purity copper (99.94% minimum to meet the spec) and then during the melt, a very small, precisely controlled amount of oxygen is added. What the oxygen does is scavenge impurities and remove them from solution. The result is an increase in the copper's conductivity compared to what it would be if the impurities were left in solution.
The "problem" with ETP copper is that if it's heated in a reducing atmosphere such as hydrogen, as you might find in a hydrogen annealing furnace, the hydrogen can react with the oxygen in the copper causing it to become embrittled.
For situations such as that, oxygen free copper is used. Because oxygen free copper can't take advantage of oxygen scavenging, it has to have a higher inherent purity in order to achieve the same conductivity as ETP copper.
Because we don't recommend our cables be used in things like hydrogen annealing furnaces, we just use ETP copper.

I have just started listening to my pair of //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 re-cabled with a solid core silver/gold cable. System is a HEX Dac to the Cavalli LAu.
 
Grooving to Fourplay at the moment......
 
 

 
 
Brief thoughts are that the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 is a very mellow, euphonic and sweet sounding pair of headphones. Good sense of spacial cues within a very nicely sized soundstage, which is well differentiated in the x, y, and z axis. There is still the slight mid/upper bass bump which for me is very pleasant and drives the music along very nicely, not as pronounced as it's sibling the LCD 2. I am of the opinion that the sonic presentation is very reminiscent of how a well set up Linn Sondek LP12 sounds through a good system, as I did with the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2, but the //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 has a better arm and cartridge.
 
 
I will try and post more detailed impressions at a later stage, and perhaps make comparisons with the //MARK\\Abyss and //MARK\\HD800.

This is //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 Appreciation thread.
 
Not //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\XC
 
I don't like closed headphones, I need to get a mobile dac/amp for these, cause I don't mind disturbing others, as these are the only headphones that I can hear to.
 
I mean seriously... I will have to write a review.
Can anyone please tell me what kind of "Microdetail" or "Microscopic detail" they are talking about when they say the //MARK\\HD800? Maybe they are very picky headphones. But so far, in terms of detail, my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 have 10 times more detail. The sound is real, true to life, bass is deep and controlled and when it needs to be, Impactful. People here are asking for more bass impact out of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, but they don't understand that //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 have special bass, it's real, it's controlled, it's deep, it does beat, only realistically.
 
Another something, I've heard classical through //MARK\\HD700, and //MARK\\HD800, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's are so totally owning these, like on another different level.
 
The //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 have warm sound, black background, like literally... I don't know how blacker can it be, my //MARK\\HD700 are toys next to my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's. The Sibilance on the //MARK\\HD700 is ridiculous.

I've heard this story 10000 times too & I agree.  I trust my ears more than I trust stories.... I am 100% sure that there are differences. If there weren't I wouldn't buy a cable just for the looks...or the smell :))
 
I am not saying this is not true to some audiophiles....but this excuse is used too much...
 
I had times I believed it to be better because of the price before listening to it, bought it, and afterwards disregarding the more expensive cable and remained with the stock. (this happened many times)

Also had a period that I wasn't attracted to my sound system no longer, and then realized it was a coax cable that made the sound very slow...(for me), changed it and then all was ok again.
 
I have said this a few times now. The problem is that our audio memory if not trained (or have it naturally) is very low, as we are visual animals that rely on vision, not hearing.
 
The question is this :  How well can you distinguish subtle differences in rhythm?
 
The above test is good for audio memory and also for hearing. If you have a low score and have problems in telling 2 different rhythms apart, I think it would be even harder to distinguish the differences in sounds with same rhythm but with other changes in details, soundstage, transients, etc
 
There is also a question of hearing capabilities and age (I have done an audio-gram recently and I have close to perfect hearing...)
 
I find it funny when somebody doesn't see something...and then he wants to believe that all in the world should be like him and nobody else sees that, and all who see are wrong because..HE cannot. ( it is more comforting  to believe that, I guess )
 
P.S. Last week I did a blind test with a friend (coax cables, digital, not even analog) and I recognized the cables...easily ( even in digital you can see the difference. I agree to the fact that you shouldn't but that only happens with digital done right and I have only listened to one dac that did that)

So far I'm really enjoying it, really...
 
Just that I'm feeling like I'm lacking quite a lot with the STX, the soundstaging/openness is not as pronounced, even compared to the //MARK\\HD700.
Some instruments are more or less defined, but others seem like they are uhm... well, don't know how to really explain it, but it's really there's no definition whatsoever, compared to the others. It is clear that I'm not using even these 10% of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's.
At times there's also a bit sibilance I'm thinking the STX is the culprit, like I said, the //MARK\\HD700 felt VERY sibilant lately.
 
I've tried several Gain settings but it doesn't do much other than really adding to the volume, so I'm running through the regular 0 to 64 ohm setting.
 
Folks, here's the thing, I might go for the Bakoon HPA-21 at some point will have to work at it. One thing that's bothering me with them is that I'm on my PC most of the time, at times more than these 6.5 hours that it claims to handle. Is this amp really considered the best there is for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's? If not, do tell me what is?
 
 
ATM I've set my mind to the Audio-gd NFB-28, though together with the Bakoon HPA-21 (If that's the case) I'll want to get a proper DAC that can handle DSD, like the Mytek 192 DSD or Yulong D8 (The latter is sexy and has a nice screen)
 
A friend and I are having an argument, he thinks money is everything, if it costs more, than it's better. And no chance Audio-gd NFB-28 will do anything good to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's - Tell me what to tell this person to prove them wrong? :))
 
P.S: The store owner that sold me the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's is thinking of getting some custom cables for the headphones - do these make so much difference? Are they worth it?

No. :)
 
But there's hope. I agree with Solude, work your way up, find what YOU like. I would probably skip the lowest end though, if you upgrade make it worthwhile. Buying used and reselling won't be much of a penalty. It's probably best to stay away from niche products (like the Bakoon), as there could be wallet damage if you don't like them. Most of us find somewhere where we settle (even if somewhat temporarily) within our own constraints. The good news to you is starting with the STX, the downstream upgrades will be at least or more rewarding than your headphones purchases.
 
Headphones cables imo make a difference, but they're about the last thing to worry about after you've sorted out the DAC & AMP.
 
It's probably best to stay away from cheap tube gear. It's just as bad as cheap SS with the disadvantage that if you get caught into tube rolling you'll have another pile of stuff to sell. Higher-end tube amps that's something else.

I have been battling between buying the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 or the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X for a couple of weeks now. I'd already paid upfront for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 but put the order on hold until RMAF was over. I've been reading every single related comment and impression about the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X and trying to absorb as much information as I can about both headphones, to the point where I feel my head's going to explode.
Well I've decided that with my limited experience in this area, and not being able to demo either headphone, any difference(s) between them will make little impact on me.
What I mean by that is that I think I will be blown away by the sound quality of either one of these headphones. And I think the subtle differences between the sound characteristics between the two, will probably go unnoticed to my untrained ears.
Therefore I have just emailed my dealer to go ahead with my original order for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3! There! Phew! I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
Now I'm just looking forward to receiving them and starting to enjoy my music. No more worrying and no more stress.
And hopefully the following month I will join these up with a Burson Conductor.

Hello to all, I discovered something tonight, kind of a shock for me: forget the basshead thing, somehow narrow soundstage, if you really want to make justice to your //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\3 source them with a decent turntable + phonostage and a good amp. I'm just having the big smile on my face (with a little help from Ardbeg 10 years Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (I recommend strongly by the way!!!) ;-). I just moved to my headphone listening room the turntable that was getting dusty next to my speaker system in the mainroom and this is far the best way I've heard the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 sounding. It's just so what I was expecting from 2000 eur spend on this eadphones, now it looks like I'm an happy man, just will have to expand my vinyl collection.
 
I made some direct comparisons with same tracks vinyls vs computer (and I think I have a not that bad source with computer see my signature): no way to compete until now, vinyl is just putting you much much more into the music, I'm very surprised and shocked. And it's going very very well with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. No more complain on soundstage and bass that I found was too prominent in general (as many people). This is just great now. It's not that the soundstage is that much wider but it's more airy, deeper. Everything is sounding that much "direct microphone to headphone", your in the music and just stop listening to your gears. It's just more natural...

Thanks all. They are very classy looking I must admit.
 
I got these without any demo whatsoever, mainly because there is no local dealer. My local dealer ordered these for me from the UK distributor, and also ordered //MARK\\LCD2 for his shop demo.
When I collected my //MARK\\LCD3, which were all boxed and sealed, I listened to his //MARK\\LCD2 with a Burson Conductor amp. I must say I was not impressed. I expected much more than that.
 
So I came home with a huge feeling of anxiety that the //MARK\\LCD3 won't be the sort of standard I've been hearing of on these forums, and what I was expecting.
And when I plugged them directly into my macbook and played some music, I wasn't impressed at all. In fact I was panicking that I've just wasted all that money and that I should have got something like //MARK\\Fostex //MARK\\TH900 ....
 
I've been running these in for a few days now - I think it's been about 30 or so hours. And I have to admit that they do sound better than day one. Still nothing like what I expected, but ... I'm beginning to see/hear the potential. Some of my music sounds very plain and dull (including some 24bit/96khz files), but some sound very nice and lush (even some 320kbps mp3's ...).
I'm hoping that they just need plenty of running in and a good amp and source.
 
So I'm going to keep running these as much as possible and in a month or two, look to add a good amp to the system.
I thought I'd be impressed with the Burson Conductor but I wasn't. Whether that was due to the out-of-the-box //MARK\\LCD2 or cos that's how it is, I don't know.
Can anyone suggest a good amp at similar price? Some of the gear talked about on the forums is probably a bit difficult to demo in UK. From what I've read, I'm kind of leaning towards Auralic Taurus (realising that I'd need a separate DAC too) at the moment.
Ideally an amp/dac combo would be the best, but happy to consider separates.
 
cheers,

i got toe hear the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X at the chicago meet and wanted to post some impressions for those //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 owners considering the X.
 
i got to compare //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2r2, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2r1 on the Master 8, the GSX MK2, and the Mjolnir/Gungnir stack. it was nice having all the audeze's there.
 
anyways, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X are great, but its up to you to decide. i felt the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X was more like an upgrade to the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X definitely had the audeze warmth, it was slightly darker and more neutralish like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2, but not as dark. the treble is better on //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X, its not as colored. and its nothing like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 seemed just a tiny tiny bit more resolving, but its too close to call, mostly, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is smoother, bigger soundstage, slightly leaner in a way i think. but very similar. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is creamy, smooth, more colored, and lighter on the bass than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X, but more resolving (slightly), and liquidy. 
 
the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X goes more towards the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 sound. being more neutral as in more treble and less dark and closed in. theres no congestion, but the soundstage is smaller than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. the bass, its awesome! its more than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, its like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 bass, but deeper and more extended. in some ways, i prefer the X and am considering it. its that magic middle i wanted, that more forward, more slam, more attack, less creamy sounding //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, but i also really like how good the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 sounds, wider, more smooth, more liquid, so "yummy" as Tyll describes it.
 
anyways, its too close to call. i think the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is still the flagship, but i kinda like the bass of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X more, it hits harder with that similar slam and sound of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X is much more like the 2 than the 3, but they're all so similar, definitely the same house sound.
 
now as for the rev 1..... its more forgiving, but its also less resolving and a step below the others. it sounded great on the mjolnir/gungnir though. i know people rave about this combo, i think it suits the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 better than the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 or //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X but thats just imo.
 
anyways, if you are a //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 owner. the X is great, but its too close that its not worth selling the 3 probably unless you like the slightly more //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2-esque presentation and are willing to trade some of the //MARK\\LCD3's liquidity and spaciousness for the extra bass and slightly more forward/punchy sound of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2. performance-wise, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X isn't better, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 isn't better. i prefer both in different ways since they overlap. i like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s overall refinement more, but i like the energy bass and neutrality (as in colorations, not neutral as in freq response) that the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X carries. i am thinking of owning both, but they're too close sounding that i feel that i'd be happy with either one. and it'd be silly to own both.

yes the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X has more weight. due to the bass, its more like an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 in many aspects.
 
there is no harshness or etchedness like the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2. its more //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 like in the treble because the treble is better. theres more of it but its not etched. just its not smoothed out either. its more neutral.
 
i find the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 to be the //MARK\\HD //MARK\\650, and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X to be the //MARK\\HD //MARK\\600. thats the best analogy i can think of. i posted some more impressions in the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X thread. and answered some questions to clarify. i'll try and keep my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X talk there so more people can see it. just wanted to point it out here since i know many //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 owners are dying to know whether they should sell their //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 or not. i don't think they should unless they hear the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X and decide if they prefer that presentation of the Audeze house sound better. 
 
as for resolution, it overlaps, the treble is simmilar. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X is more forward like //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2, you might hear some things more. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is more laid back and smooth, you might hear some things less. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X has more bass slam and body like the 2, its also slower though, that will change it as well.
 
its close enough i think neither really pulls out ahead.
 
the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 just has a sort of magic to it with its smoothness and large soundstage that make it the "flagship" still. the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 still though, sometimes leaves me wanting a little more bass, or more engagement, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X is there, but it also loses some of that magic the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 has. its really hard to decide. i don't even know myself if i wanna get the X. ideally i'd have both. but they're also too close to decide on. the bass on the X i really enjoy though, its more //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 like and that was the thing i loved most of the 2s.

I listen to a lot of modern metal, rock and punk albums. There are plenty of albums that are well recorded in the underground music metal scene, but for the most part mastering leaves something to be desired. Mind you I listen to about 200 new metal/rock/punk albums a year and I'd say that around half of the recordings are lower than optimal. Still music you enjoy is music you enjoy 
 
The notable thing usually is that the recording of drums and cymbals utterly sucks. I tend to go toward a brighter headphone here to make up for it. The bass on many metal albums is weak and leaves a lot of be desired.
 
In this case it isn't the headphone but the mastering. I know I don't have the //MARK\\LCD3's but I've got the //MARK\\LCD2r2 and the problem is there a fair bit. Mine is one of the newer "unveiled" models, or at least the treble is much more elevated than older //MARK\\LCD //MARK\\2's.

I'm surprised my post has been taken the way it has. I was trying to say that I'm enjoying my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 a lot, and that's just by running them straight out of a MacBook just now. As I've never had a high-end headphone or an amp/dac, I can't even imagine how much better I can expect, because I've never experienced it before.
Of course I'm going to be amping them. In fact I started a thread a couple of months ago, asking for amp and dac advice, and currently making a shortlist. A couple of members are also messaging me directly with advice and their experience in similar situation to mine.
It's just my wallet is a bit sore from recent purchases (which includes the MacBook Pro and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3) so I won't be able to get anything until after christmas now. So don't worry, I won't let them suffer for long. They'll get all the power they need very soon. :-)
 
Apologies for any misunderstanding.

Hey! I am thinking of getting the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3. I have not heard this nor //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\2, since I live in Sweden, and there is no place what I know that sell these headphones, so it's impossible for me to listen to these. I was thinking of getting the //MARK\\Sennheiser //MARK\\hd800, since I listened to them. But I read really much about the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 and what people describe, it fits me better. I am gonna save together for an Woo wa22 amplifier (and run the headphones balanced, since I got a hegel hd20 dac wich is fully balanced), and also for an //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 or the //MARK\\hd800.
I mean, I think it will be easy to sell the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 if I wouldn't like it, and just buy the //MARK\\hd800 after that. But not sure if I am making a mistake here.
 
Do you guys think I will do a bad choice and buy the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 without auditioning it?

Hey MacedonianHero! I seen you posted ages ago on a thread about amps for //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 about you were listening to the Wa22 amp with the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3. I am looking for an amp to buy with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 the same time. I am still quite torn apart of what im going to get.
 
Been considering going SS, but I am a bit sensitive against SS amps as I find them a bit harsh against my head, but I am not sure if these headphones will sound bright with a proper SS amp?
And the wa22 (which I tried google as much as possible about) have everything I want but dunno if it pairs up that well, and starting to find more people that doesn't think it is such a good amp as some people think.
 
Zashoomin mentioned the Little Dot MkVIII amp, but is it truly balanced? I see it put outs more power and someone mentioned that //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\3 works well when it get much much power :) + It's alot cheaper hehe.
 
Do you know if there are any other decent options if I wanna go balanced?
I got myself as I mentioned already, a truly balanced source, (Hegel hd20) and I want to get an //MARK\\HD800 in the future and not having to upgrade the amp.

Sitting here drinking a few beers and listening to some early 70's Grateful Dead . Had the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's about three months now and am enjoying them immensely. Running them with a DIY 45 dht tube amp fed with an NOS Metrum Octave dac. Perhaps not the most "neutral" system in a modern sense, but a very engaging classical analog-like presentation reminescent of a good vinyl rig. Slightly warm and full, but excellent detail, definition, and speed, just a half step up off electrostatic standards. Vocals, particularly female, are more rounded and three dimensional than my //MARK\\Stax //MARK\\507's. Power and impact of live electric guitar is better as well. Compared to the //MARK\\HD800's,the sound stage is smaller,but the resolution is on par,and there is none of the irritating etchy top end. Bass is the best I've ever heard in any headphone.
No headphone is perfect. Some will find the top end a bit rolled off by modern standards, but my 60 year old ears can't hear it. A bit bigger sound stage would be nice. But overall, great fun and my favorite non-electrostatic headphone for classic rock.

After reading about the //MARK\\LCDX I am beginning to get a bit of an itch and I am wondering if any of you could share some thoughts on where I should go next.
 
Right now I am running //MARK\\HD800s through a Burson Soloist with a X-Sabre DAC. I've had the //MARK\\HD800 for a few months now and they have been like opening Pandora's box for me. They sound great and of course detailed, but there is just a little something in the pleasure department missing. And one of the biggest issues I have had after using the //MARK\\HD800 is that I simply cannot go back to my old //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\500, as although they are enjoyable they are quite unresolving in comparison to the //MARK\\HD800.
 
So I have been wondering if the //MARK\\LCD3 may be an answer for this. I'm looking for phones that are resolving, dynamic and present the music's emotion well.

I find the 3s to be the most incredible musical reproduction experience apart from an extreme high end speaker system (can feel the bass) that I have ever heard. All I can say is they are going to have to come up with something other-worldly awesome to make me consider purchasing some other cans. No matter the genre every listening experience is a memorable experience. I am starting to learn to listen to music in a new way by separately tracking via instrumental separation the story line of each instrument as they all weave the composition together.
 
I am sure the X and the XC are also awesome phones, but owning the 3s has been [is] such a pivotal change in the listening experience that it will take something really exceptional to best these phones. Possibly an LCD4 but for now I have this nice setup and a comfy chair to lean back into and close the eyes and just get wrapped up in the composition...

YES-
and I'm a huge evangelist/fan of Audeze - as MANY of you already know.
But, admittedly (and this was only judging from an instinct I had) when I first heard the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 and 3 I told Alex that I "wish I could hear what these headphones are truly capable of"!
 
That may sound nuts, but coming from the high end audio 2-channel world, I heard my fair share of snake oil,
and the real deal when it comes to cables...
 
and I KNEW I could squeeze more performance out of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3!!
 
now I own the following for my Audeze cans:
ALO Green Line cables
Cardas Clear
Moon Audio Silver Dragon V3 w/ adapter kit
Wywires prototype cable
Double Helix Compliment(2) - which is my favorite pairing thus far, and newest cable of the bunch!
 
if you can't afford to spend much on cables for your Audeze cans,
go for the ALO Green Line - w/ the adapter kit  KILLER for the price!!

not really unbelievable, having a source, amp, with recessed but quick punchy sub bass and bass and a very grainy treble and with overall less detail would make the 2 and 3 more similar than different
 
but what would be the point of having such lo-fi chain for 1k$+ cans 
 
the //MARK\\lcd2 and //MARK\\lcd3 are very different indeed, on a competent chain
 
don't know what's the reason of so much debate, fuss, about the //MARK\\lcd2 being more punchy than the 3s, it's a fact, just look at their respective measurements
 
than again //MARK\\lcd3 does have more bass presence, especially in the sub bass, and it's more fun, liquid quick, more detailed
 
for those that looks for a better //MARK\\lcd2 and reach for the 3 as an upgrade, they might find it being an overall better can but consistently different in sound from the //MARK\\lcd2, and not liking the lcd3 sound, than it's hardly an upgrade from the 2
 
so far i found the //MARK\\lcd3 to be the more realistic sounding, and most emotional pair of cans i had to date in my setup
 
waiting for the //MARK\\he-//MARK\\6 to arrive, from looking at the measurements it's not difficult to tell that the //MARK\\lcd3 and //MARK\\he-//MARK\\6, and probably the //MARK\\lcd-//MARK\\x too, are indeed the "poor man's" //MARK\\stax //MARK\\sr-//MARK\\009

I still have my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2's but hadn't really listened to them since I got the 3's, until a few days ago.  On my setup the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2's sound very good, but the 3's are another level in every regard (I care about).
 
When evaluating bass, I like to listen to something that has bass created from a synthesizer, but also something that has bass created from an analog, especially acoustic source.  I listen to the latter because I want to hear the the bass note in its entirety, eg., from the time the string is plucked until I can't hear the note anymore.  For me, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's are again, on another level in this department.  Bass notes sound more natural and have better extension.  As far as how hard bass hits and how deep it goes, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's just play what's there.
 
These Audeze's aren't like lesser headphones a lot of us have had.  Source, amplification, and even cables make a difference in the way they sound.

the //MARK\\lcd3 does have more resolution, detail etc... but also in terms of sound, when compared, the //MARK\\lcd3 and //MARK\\lcd2, they present the music differently, enough differently that many do not feel comfortable thinking of the lcd3 as the pure successor of the //MARK\\lcd2 and/or end missing some of the sound of the //MARK\\lcd2
 
but of course all the lcds share the audeze house sound, the same soundprint that makes you feel 'oh, yeah, that's an audeze on my ears'
 
then again i'm not debating, is it like this or like that, since different chains and ears equal to different experiences, but more making some observation other may find useful when looking for some infos
 
again since i listened to both cans for extended periods and on the same chain, it's not like i write about it cos i think it's like that but cos i experienced it being like that

People I need your help here, the thing is that I've got now the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's and it's one of the best if not the best (I haven't heard the //MARK\\SR-//MARK\\009 yet) headphones atm, at least the best that I've got :)
 
I'm looking for getting a better audio setup, something that will really wow me, I'm pairing the headphones with the STX sound card, and I must say that I don't know why you're saying it's such a mediocre sound card/DAC, I'm finding it quite good actually.
 
Like I've posted before about this, I went to listen to the Antelope Zodiac Platinum DAC, and while it's great there are some things I'm not really sure about, one of them being that their customer support is really too careful about giving out information about the DAC, which is a warning sign... the thing is that at this price point I'm looking to be getting something really really really amazing for a really long time.
 
So anyways, please people help me out here, I'm looking to spend about this amount of money for the best DAC at this price point, that there can't be possibly anything better and something that will really pair well with the headphones. - Say, can Resonessence Invicta possibly be a better DAC?
 
Any help is appreciated :)

Sorry, it doesn't matter to me how awesome sounding the DAC is, if it doesn't support all of the formats/sampling rate/bitrate that's available today, it's not good enough for me. I know that there's some debate about validity of anything above 24/96 and EVEN 16/44.1 but in some cases I can clearly hear the difference, and I really hate being limited in any way shape or form.
 
So anyway, there's a few options for me based on DACs: Antelope Zodiac Platinum, Auralic Vega (of course with some headphone Amp), Resonessence Invicta. (If you've got any other DACs you can suggest here)
 
Biggest problem with Zodiac Platinum is what I said from before (Their company is trying to hide info on the DAC itself as if it's magical and can do wonders because it costs so much and has 4 DAC chips/64bit AFC whatever) and also the lack of any discussion about it + No reviews whatsoever, and the ones we have are by questionable "audiophiles" (6moons.... I mean I don't doubt that guy likes sound and music, but it's hard to follow what's going on in it, there's too much unnecessary information and because of that reviews are really not to the point and end up being useless for some of us)
 
What would you say would make me happy eternally, I mainly listen to these genres: Prog Rock/Metal, Classical, Jazz, New Age/Electronica (Era/Enigma and the like)
And based on music elements my priorities are: Detail, Musicality (I know it's a hard combination, and maybe the other proper term for this would be PRaT) and Instrument Separation.
 
If anyone can please suggest me anything good once and for all? Maybe I need to post this in a new topic... though usually these things don't get much attention :P
 
Anyway, thanks, and yes, I'm serious.

Just upgraded my stock cable to a Q French silk (1.5m length) on my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3.  A bit surprised for such a notable change. I thought the stock cable gave me a pretty decent balance. No major complaints about imaging or soundstaging (I personally think //MARK\\HD800 is a bit over the top on the latter)  but probably my chief complaint was the supressed attack. It's as if the headphone was fighting back on fast transcients.  Well, all that pretty much disappeared with the cable upgrade. Huge improvement in imaging, some in soundstaging.  Had an interesting impact on overall balance though -- that huge meaty bass lightened up and everything pushed towards the treble.  Overall, very pleased, but will take an effort to readjust my ears again.  But does make me wonder, did they tune //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 to sound darker with the stock cable, or is the intended signature the brighter flavor of aftermarket cabling?

Eric,
 
Some things I ran into myself with the 3's in the past.
 
At first when I had them it was me picking them apart what made them better than the 2's.  There was better fleshing out of the details but was the cost worth it?  At first the answer was no but I spent more time with them and came to like them more even after letting them go.
 
Two things really changed my opinion of them for the better; the tubes I used on the BA and the cable.  Out of the tubes I have stashed away, I like the green label Sylvania 6sn7gt or vt-231 by and far and in my experience the best choice of driver tube that I have found (I don't remember the exact version but the plates are not triangled).  Luckily they aren't rare or expensive!
 
The cable thing I really didn't want to believe at first.  I am not a fan of expensive aftermarket cables.  When I swapped to a stupidly expensive ALO reference 16 cable the difference was night and day and I coudln't go back.  I don't think that putting $6-700 is a smart move necessarily but maybe something more reasonable can lead to similar performance gains.  In hindsight I wish I never sold off that cable!  Perhaps it was decreased resistance or something that made the difference, I still need to figure out what the hell was going on there.
 
I don't have a Dynahi but out of my gs-x with mk2 modules they were not really my cup of tea, could have been a source issue too at the time I had a Lynx Hilo and it may have been a little too analytic.  I know lots of folks recommend the GS-X mk2 for the LCD-3's but I'm just not seeing it, maybe it is the mk1 vs mk2 difference makes or breaks it but I doubt it.

Great post firstly. I do find the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's growing on me and thought I heard improvements over the 2 (mostly in the transparency department but at the expense of some heft). When I threw on the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2's (Dynahi) I just kind of forgot about the 3 and felt they were also tonally pleasant and enjoyable (particularly for indie stuff), but ultimately forgettable next to some of the others. I like that they're relatively forgiving, but that shouldn't be the high point for a $2000 headphone. I ran the BA with Mullard ECC35, a tube I like more in my Zana Deux. I'll have to try out the Sylvania you mentioned, As for cables I have a Norse Norn on my //MARK\\LCD - //MARK\\2 that I can try, but I never really thought any of my after market cables made a big difference. As for the Dynahi, I thought it was bigger, badder, better than the GSX I heard. Just more oomph and a more stable image, but these qualities, especially with my Lampizator, can make the LCD's a little too hefty and lacking finesse, or maybe the bombast just gets tiresome. Maybe I'll pick an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 in the future if the price continues to drop on them, but at the moment they would need to do a little more to stay in the stable.

It's hard for me to explain perfectly but I'll try. With the Schiit stack, the sound kind of projectiles into your ear. It doesn't cozy up, exchange pleasantries, and softly seep into your ears. It takes the music with amazing clarity and dynamics, and shoots it out of cannon into your skull. For instance I like to listen before I go to bed. This is not a good idea with the schiit, as they'll keep you up til 3am with adrenaline to spare. For me, I love this quality for 20-30 mins or so, but once you start changes songs/genres it starts to add up and becomes very fatiguing.
 
Another thing to note is that I'm making these assumptions based on the Gungnir AND Mjolnir. I've heard various accounts that its the Gungnir that brings out the brightness/aggression of the MJ, not the MJ calling the shots. Not sure how much I believe that though..

I've got a friend who I'm sharing my audiophile endeavors with and he owns //MARK\\HD600 atm, he can't stand sibilance AT ALL! even if it's fairly natural sibilance. He keeps asking me why does it happen, last thing I told him is that it was recorded like that, and he replies with "But it's not natural, I'm not talking to you like thisss" of course all of that in russian, but you get the point.
 
Speaking of which I have to agree with him. It's weird that things are recorded in that way. Better yet the question is why? :)
 
Regarding the DAC, if PWD would promise to have DSD support in the near future, I'm willing to give it a try, but if it doesn't, I'd rather get something else like Auralic Vega or the X-Sabre (I've heard some tracks with the CuBox on youtube, seems fine on treble harshness, though that would be on speakers but I've heard it through the LCD-3's, on headphones, it's a different story) and also some space for the PWD mk2... but generally I'm looking forward to any coming up DACs, the thing is, to enjoy balanced sound I would need the the DAC to have balanced out, and since I'm using the STX card atm, I would have to be getting RCA to it.

Get it to the Greek XD
 
Well, the Geek DAC will have DSD and DXD support apparently, and the cost on that one is pretty low, though we've also got that Teac DAC that has support, the question is implementation.
 
I understand why most of you are content without DSD, due to not having enough content and most of you are probably just playing CDs (16/44.1) which is also not all that bad, but hi-res has its place and I can see that especially with properly mastered tracks it helps quite a lot to bringing the details.
 
About the PWD mk2, it looks great, and even functional, but it goes as far up to 24/192... and it's sort of big. I'm having problems imagining where I'm going to put all of it, especially because it's not a good idea to stack these devices one on each other. if it had DSD right now and with the current rave about it, I wouldn't think too much and get it, especially if you say that it's the best pairing with the LCD-3's. But atm it doesn't, and if any of you say that they promised DSD on firmware update soon, I would like citation :)
 
Regarding the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's and pairing it with the STX card so far, I can say that it doesn't suffer from any analytical problems, the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's can make a horrible recording sound fine, but when there are proper recordings, it just sings! The bass, most of you were saying that it's lacking, but  I don't, I find that it doesn't have extreme unnatural bass where you get thump, so maybe not the best for electronic and rap/hip-hop/dubstep, though maybe I'm just missing that last bit of power which I'm hopefully going to get with the GS-X mk2 amp (And if I have to wait 6-7 months for it, that won't be fun)
 
I've also noticed that some of you have sold their //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 in favor for the new //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X and like it better, even some good reviews for it, but you can't de-crown a flagship that easily. I'm keeping my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and will only switch to //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\4 if we get it, maybe not, I'm really close to being very very very happy (Although I might need another pair like the //MARK\\HD800 for the weight problem of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's...)
 
Anyway, thanks for all the help so far :)
 
Edit: I have just found the dealer for the PWD Mk2 in israel, hopefully they will be selling it still when I get my GS-X mk2 (I'll be putting an order after the 10th) and I'm thinking I'll try to get an audition on this setup, but the thing is, the PWD Mk2 here doesn't cost the same price as you said it costs 16,800 ILS which is almost 5,000 USD, based on google it's: 4778.02 US Dollar

BTW, speaking of the PWD Mk2 DAC, I've been researching and even watched this really decent video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6aE1Z_j6Bw
That guy seems to be pretty good and pretty much no nonsense, as well as funny.
 
I'm doing more research on it as we speak, but here's the big question - If it is such an amazing DAC that a lot of you are really enjoying, why isn't there a dedicated topic about it like this one... Even though I'm taking this thread more of an owner of //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's topic and people here are also talking about related gear, but still, just like other DACs have dedicated topics like Yulong DA8, Matrix X-Sabre, and others.
 
P.S: If I really get it after the GS-X mk2 amp, do you think I can stack all devices on each other, would that work or will it be a really bad idea? Again I'm thinking I'll have to think a lot about space, this doesn't look like a little DAC...
 
I want to hear more about this DAC, if there are any more good reviews you can share with me/us, would be highly appreciated :)

Thank you for breaking down the differences, Kojaku +rep
 
I just received my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 last night and have been thoroughly enjoying them on my mjol/gung stack, //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2 should show up in a few hours from now. I will be A/B'ing the two to decide which I prefer to keep. 
 
I had the chance to audition the X and the 3 side by side for about an hour on a top tier McIntosh amp, not sure exactly what model it was. I did prefer the X's, when driven off of that amp. Everything just sounded so lifelike in comparison, I actually felt like the artists were singing in the same demo room that I was sitting in. The 3s sounded veiled/muffled in comparison.
 
However, on my setup I do not have that same impression. 
 
I can't get the X's out of my head, though. Really curious how it would sound being fed from the mjol/gung stack. 
 

 
Please do let us know what your thoughts are when you have a chance to compare the two when being fed from the mjol/gung. I am EXTREMELY curious how the Xs perform on this stack, compared to the 2s.

The suck-out at 8kHz is not really there. This was a feature of all of the graphs of earlier //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s and was to do with the positioning of the microphone and nothing to do with the headphones. Also somewhere in this thread we had a major comparison of different charts and found they all vary a little bit. But interestingly all the newer ones are either closer to the mic, or the output sound is louder as they graph is consistently shifted upwards compared to earlier ones. As was said at the time, the graph is really just to prove they tested it and not that your headset may truly have a higher level of treble at 10kHz than your friends.
 
I have compared a 2013 model against my 2012 and while I could convince myself there were miniscule differences here and there, there was absolutely no fundamental frequency response change between the two. And I have over-sensitive high frequency hearing (which means the HD800 are really an uncomfortable listen for me)

Well I would like to think my ears were better than to miss all those differences you describe especially as I am over sensitive in the treble region. I was able to have both //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s together side by side connected to two Burson Soloist amps (As my friend has the same one). We level matched them and then put segments of a music track on a loop and swapped the headphones as quickly as we could. Neither of us picked up on the things you said. Can I ask if you were able to compare side by side, or you were trying //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s at different times but never had two of them together at once?
 
Of course it is possible that the differences you heard are nothing to do with 2012 or 2013 or 2014...but that every //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is different and I just happened to find two that are similar. Such a high-end headphone should not be like that though. They have also stuck with serial numbers starting 261 whereas normally Audeze change the prefix after manufacturing changes.
 
Please understand I am not saying you are wrong and I am right....more than that, I do believe what you described, and I am more worried about these silent changes. It would be nice to hear from Audeze. As I mentioned in an earlier post I thought I was listening to a 2014 model, but the graph was 2013. You said you heard a 2013 model as well...at that point did it still sound similar to you to earlier ones? (i.e. are you suggesting this is a VERY recent change roughly in-line with the release of the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X?)

My unit is a 261 and the chart is from August 2012. Very briefly I had a repaired 231 unit (it never had a previous owner, but the store had sent it back for checking and the drivers were replaced), and I had issues with it due to a sibilance issue at the equivalent of Middle C on a piano. I have no idea why it was like that. I use my headphones extensively for piano, including the use with a digital piano. The Audeze were by far the best headphones for this purpose with the //MARK\\HD800 and //MARK\\PS1000 being totally unsuitable due to over pronounced treble. They sounded completely wrong whereas the Audeze recreates the piano timbre perfectly.
 
But you had your 231 repaired twice with new drivers, so effectively it became a 261 anyway :)
 
If there are changes in the headphones (261), then they must be very recent indeed.

Hello everyone,  I know that Auralic thread is not getting too much attention, but I'm really readying on buying a DAC, the question is, I've so far almost totally pulled the trigger on the Auralic Vega, but I need your suggestion, as I'm an //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 user, now also own the Schiit Lyr meanwhile for the tubiness (still waiting for the silly voskhod tubes to arrive, not to mention some silly RCA cables that apparently is not original)
 
Anyway, I can spend max $3.5k atm, I need the best DAC money can give me at this price range and priority for: DSD/DXD support + Detail + Analogue feeling
 
Need your answer ASAP! it depends on the loan I'm getting (Yeah, I don't like waiting for things) I need the complete answer literally ASAP!
 
Very interested in Auralic Vega vs cheaper variants, say, Matrix X-Sabre or Yulong DA8 or Lynx Hilo (I'm guessing it's supposed to support DSD although I haven't seen it mentioned on their website lately) or Benchmark DAC 2 or whatever.
 
Also, possible a combination of Auralic Taurus mk2 + Matrix X-Sabre or similar, what would you say about that?
 
Please, very important!

I wish I was in your situation right now. Unfortunately I have to wait a lot longer. I also have the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 and the Auralic Vega (and Taurus mkII) is at top of my DAC list.
I have spent considerable amount of time reading every review and (almost) every user comment on the Vega that I can find. I have heard nothing but remarkable things about it. I'm definitely very impressed with what I have read.
 
However, the Ayre Acoustic QB-9 DSD is also considered to be excellent though it only has a USB input so a little bit limiting compared to the Vega.
 
You may also want to take a look at Chord Hugo which is currently getting some very good feedback and (in UK) is about half the price of the Vega.
 
Good luck in deciding and please let us know what you go for (and later on your impressions on your purchase)
 
cheers,
 
Shaka

Happy Vega + Hilo (+ DA11) owner here!
I also bought Taurus mkII for fun, as a 2nd amp...
However I don't use my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 anymore, just //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X (and even //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 with Taurus).
I haven't listened to Hilo since I bought the Vega.
 
From my initial notes comparing the two DACs Hilo is a little bit more "blunt", in your face, more 2D.
Vega is more refined, maybe a little bit "thinner" sounding, builds a room with layers of details that you can listen to, but only if you want to. Vega is more 3D, has a wider soundstage, and has a more dynamic bass.
 
I prefer Taurus over my BHA-1, at least for headphones. As a preamp BHA-1 may be more transparent, hard to test with all switching of XLR cables...
I don't think Taurus has less treble than BHA-1, maybe Taurus has a little bit "fuller" sound though. I haven't compared the two amps that much.
Taurus has a sharper treble with more sibilance than my Bakoon HPA-21, my 1st amp. However Taurus is a very good amp, I can even listen to //MARK\\HE-//MARK\\6 with it, at least when adding some eq...
 
In the beginning I had problems with Vega having drop-outs with the clock set to exact. After trimming my old laptop for music I almost never have a drop-out, it mostly happens when changing sampling frequency. You should always use the exact clock mode. One of the best things with Vega (as well as with HPA-21) is that it sounds so good with ordinary 16/44 material.
 
  
=============================================
Topic: 10374631 in thread 588429
=============================================


 
I got a frequency chart for my BHA-1, and it is ruler flat (of course). I remember from my comparisons between HPA-21 and BHA-1 that BHA-1 had a tiny bit more treble energy. It's the same thing with Taurus, but I think that the Taurus sound "signature" is closer to HPA-21. Using //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X, "s" sounds are maybe a little bit louder in Taurus than in HPA-21, but not much. However the sibilance is more irritating in Taurus. With HPA-21 you hear overly bright "s" sounds but they are not so "irritating", IMO. Note that this is with //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X, not //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3. Both Taurus and HPA-21 are optimized for //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 according to the manufacturers. It would be interesting to compare HPA-21's little brother HPA-01 with Taurus since they are in the same price range.
 
I don't play games, I play music... 
Listening to the news or some TV show via Vega - HPA-21/Taurus - //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X is fun, I often think of how good common speech, background sounds and of course music sound.

Not really gonna help with any specific recommendations but just want to share that at your target price range you most likely won't find any universally bad DAC. Most will be great for different people. But there simply isn't one best DAC for everyone. There will never be the "best" even factoring in your set of criteria, and even you yourself will have different preferences down the road as the differences of these very capable DACs, while material, are still highly dependent on synergy and personal preferences. There really is no shortcut to finding "the ONE" without the expensive journey of buying and selling different components and wires.
Since you already did your homework in Vega, why not just roll with it and take this as the starting but not finishing line? This hobby is not like PC or gaming where there is a objective "end-game". Having said that u can also just pick one, be contend, and never find out how other combos sounded like.

We're gonna organize with Ofer a headphones meet, I'll bring my equipment (Including the Lyr/Vega) you should also come, but since I won't have the vega for about 2-3 weeks so we'll have to wait a bit... But when that happens we could see if Soloist really is worth its price :)
 
Regarding the Soloist on Modi, I didn't say that I didn't completely like the Soloist, I felt like it did give me detail, certainly, and it wasn't as harsh on treble as other silly amps (*cough* Bryston BHA-1 *Cough*) regarding cables, I don't believe about them making too much of a difference, at least not as much as you're making it sound like it is (It wouldn't make a day and night difference)
 
A difference between tubes and SS is much bigger than cables, and AFAIK, 4W at 16 ohms and 6 Watt at 32 ohms is rather big, I'm feeling the authority on the Lyr very well ;)
 
 
Anyhow, cheers, freaking foggy here atm :-/

Not entirely sure if this thread is the best place to share my thoughts and try to get some advice on system pairing, but figured I'd try. I'm at the end of my trial period with the Schiit gear tomorrow, so I'm wondering anyone who has come to similar findings has any recommended course of action for me.
 
Quick summary of me and my preconceived notions:
It's been a long time, but I used to play a woodwind and am actively learning guitar/piano (albeit poorly due to time constraints). I try to attend live music whenever possible (amped or unamped), and strive for transparency when possible and practical.
Musical tastes are all over the map, but primary listening is Female Vocalists, Metal, Hard Rock, Pop. Smattering of everything else: Classical, Opera, Bluegrass, Jazz, Movie Soundtracks, etc.
 
Fell in love with full-size planar magnetics the first time I heard them. Prefer them over electrostats (great air, but too thin with no bass) and dynamics (treble is generally too harsh and bass often isn't as tight). So the first time I got my hands on some Audeze gear, I was placing orders less than a week later.
I've always had solid state gear as tube amps/preamps were always too warm and "tubey" for me. I settled upon a Placette Passive Preamp (aside, I should see if they'll build me a volume control).
I have a few "audiophile cables", but generally believe in buying quality construction and good sound via impressions and enjoyment first, as opposed to engineering specs or endless ABX testing. Not trying to convince anyone, just trying to give you my background info.
 
After a lot of reading, I purchased the following two stacks blind, hoping both stacks would have enough synergy to drive my new //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3(for home) and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\XC(for work):
Schiit Gungnir->Mjolnir
The Mjolnir is generally described as being on the edge of the impactful/aggressive side, bordering on lunacy with the wrong source. For example:

Some think Mjolnir has an ever so slight tilt to the bright side. Gungnir descriptions seem to be all over the place. I've seen warm to neutral to bright/harsh. Since the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3s are generally considered to be "dark done right", I figured this would be OK since the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3 is the "King of Darkness".
Violectric V800->V200
The Violectric gear is generally described as being fairly neutral, with maybe a touch of warmth as their parent company comes from a recording/pro audio background. I was a bit worried it might be too dark for the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, but since I found the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\XC to be too bright with a Meridian Prime, a little "warmth" or "darkening" seemed like it would be OK for me.
 
At this point, let me add that I really wanted both of these setups to work well. what I know of Schiit and Lake People/Violectric makes me think both companies are doing things "the right way", prioritize function over form, sensible engineering, and no nonsense products.
I also want to add that I don't currently use any kind of track or album level matching (i.e. ReplayGain), so track to track level matching was done by ear/hand.
 
My experiences over more than a week:
Violectric Stack(V800->V200):
I'm very satisfied with the Violectric stack. Everything I tried was very engaging with gobs of clean controlled bass. Prat in spades that reminded me of the first time I heard the Linn Ikemi and the CD12. Instruments sounded like instruments, percussion was brilliant. Perhaps not the best treble extension with the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, but things sounded "right". 
I'd catch myself listening at a level that was a wee bit loud or soft after 5-10 seconds, so I'd try to manually reset it to try and keep subjectivity purely due to loudness to a minimum. The detents on the volume knob made adjustments pretty annoying, but it was still doable as the pot itself is continuous and I can use the volume knob on the V800 to do things in the digital domain as needed. My sources were all 16/44.1, so I should have ~4 bits to play with (assuming most 24-bit gear is only accurate to 20 bits)
 
Schiit Stack(Gungnir->Mjolnir):
Delivery was impactful, which can be fun. However, it often felt downright punishing. I found myself desperately grasphing at the volume control to reset levels quite a bit. I often found myself reaching for the volume knob because my ears didn't like what they heard. Despite the continuous travel of the knob, I had a hard time finding the right setting. The stack was at times engaging, and at times punishing. I had a hard time letting myself absorb the music.
Specific examples:
Horns on the Mambo Kings tracks were downright unlistenable. Recent pop recordings with questionable dynamic range like Paramore or Foo Fighters required a quick trigger finger on volume adjustments to make sure I didn't get my ears blown off (OK, exaggerating a little bit).
 
I'm nearing the end of my trial period with Schiit, so I figured I'd try a few last comparisons for an hour or two before I give up and and box up the Schiit gear and send it back.
V800->Mjolnir(Impressions over only 1-2 hours):
Spent about 2-3 hours with this last night and harshness/brightness/glare/whatever-you-want-to-call-it. Gone. What happened here? Is it the Gungnir that's the problem? Horns on the Mambo Kings track were downright unlistenable using Gungnir->Mjolnir, but now they sounded like horns again. Forceful, but reasonable. I guess it makes sense if the Gungnir and Mjolnir are both bright and the V800/V200 are both dark, but I didn't expect this kind of contrast. Even when I switched over to the XC it was listenable.
 
Gungnir->V200(Impressions over maybe 1 hr):
Impressions at this point are probably not useful since I'm so tired (way past my bedtime), but it seems bright, but listenable.
 
Different strokes for different folks with different ears. I get that not everyone is the same, but I'm surprised at how far into the unlistenable spectrum I found the Schiit stack considering it's consistently lauded pairing with Audeze. I know the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\2s aren't supposed to extend as far as the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3, but there's a big gap between unlistenable and bright.
 
At this point I think I should return the Mjolnir/Gungnir, and just keep the Schiit Modi/Magni and ALO Pan Am for work use until I can find another AMP/DAC combo that I like. Maybe Auralic Taurs, HeadAmp GS-X mk2, or Violectric V281? Maybe try to find a used HeadRoom BUDA?

^^ I too have no experience with the M/G stack though I have used both Lyr and Bifrost and the Violectric V100. This said, I'm not surprised the Violectric stack has worked out for you, if only because Lake People have had longer to develop their products and their synergies.
FWIW, based on intensively following various Schiit threads, it's my impression both Mjolnir and Gungnir are well regarded in their own right, but not necessarily always together. There seem to be many who own and are happy with one or other, and some happy with both. Of course, as you noted, different ears factor into this.
As well - but I could be entirely wrong - I think Mjo may be a more 'finished' product in the sense its technology is carried over to the soon-to-arrive Rag. Gungnir may be more transitional, a (considerable) refinement of the Bifrost rather than an anticipation of the Yggdrasil. Against this, purrin and friends rate Gungnir highly for its accurate tonality (but this is different from what you found, at least with Mjo in the frame) and good gradations of dynamics.
From my reading of the V800, it is detailed and transparent but maybe not as much as DACs that have come after, such as the Gungnir. Could the G be digging too much detail?

I don't know about other folks in this forum, but I've had my love affair with high-end cables come and go. I went from modding with the most exotic blends of gold, silver & copper to accepting that cables are really about a couple of things:
 
1) Functionality (Connections, Adapters, Etc)
2) Looks (Let's be honest, DHC Cables are beautiful)
3) Ergonomics (Weight, Portability, etc)
 
With this in mind, I always, ALWAYS recommend working with Steve from Q-Audio. His cables are beautiful, light, and his customer service is amazing. Pete at DHC is also amazing. One of the few innovators in the industry (with his robust adapter systems, etc). If you're especially boutique, Stefan Audio Art is another cable company I have a bit of experience with. Chunky, yes, but still beautiful and ergonomic. 
 
If you're looking for great budget cables with all these attributes, I'd say to look at BTG-Audio and HPLAudio. Talk to Chris from HPL. He's a great guy and supplies a lot of my cable/adapter needs at a  reasonable price and great quality.
 
Just depends on what you hold most important in your cable choice. Maybe let us know what you're looking for specifically, and we can help you hone your list down.

Trust me, there's no chance you'll ever mistake the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3F's for an //MARK\\HD800. The new models still operate well within the Audeze "house sound", they're just incrementally different. IMO this is a good thing, having heard the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3C's and //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X's before buying my //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3F's (which I didn't know would be "Fazorized" - Audeze had not come public with that yet). In fact when I got my "hot of the press" //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's two months ago the difference from the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\X's was super clear (they're different beasts and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's hold the crown for lushness and "magic") but I attributed the difference in slightly clearer highs and slightly more focused bass from the prior //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3's I'd heard to the slight variations across units and the fact that mine were brand new. Only after I read the huge flurry of posts here on Head-Fi did I even think to feel the inside of the pads to look for the tell-tale bumps. So rest assured, Audeze is not turning into Sennheiser and the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3F's are not all that different from the //MARK\\LCD-//MARK\\3C's.

I went to listen to the LCD 3F in a store a few days ago. They had a Sennheiser HDV-D800 as amp/dac and also the LCD X and HD 800. It was IMO clear that the LCD 3F have a warmer and more intimate sound when the LCD X and HD 800 in this setup. To me the LCD 3F have more and better bass and midrange than the HD 800 as well. The HD 800 has IMHO a more open sound and soundstage, but doesn’t have the body, soul and tonality of the LCD 3F, so they don’t sound nearly the same.  I was surprised that the LCD X didn’t sound better. To me they sound pretty flat and boring, maybe Sennheiser HDV-D800 wasn’t a good paring.
 
The biggest change to the classic in SQ, if I were to describe what I heard, was a clearer mid with a bit more upper mid energy. I have to remand you all of that the setup was different to my home rig and I didn’t have the LCD 3C at hand, but never the less it’s my impression that they still performed very well. If one will like it better than the LCD 3C will probably dependent on how one like the extra energy and clarity  in the upper mids combined with the slightly reduced sub bass and of course ones downstream gear.

Some folks who didn't use a good enough amplifier for the LCD-3 couldn't feel that bass, it was lacking in many areas.
You've got the BHA-1, which I've heard with my LCD-3, while I didn't like the extreme brightness, it also had really nice bass, definitely...
 
While LCD-3 are fairly efficient headphones, you need to match a proper amp with it, due to it being an orthodynamic, you would want to give it as much power as it can handle in a clean setup, with what some might consider proper impedance matching. So yes, LCD-3 are amazing headphones, when driven properly, I'm afraid to know just how good it will be with the Ragnarok, if Mjolnir is supposedly one of the better amps to match with the LCD-3, if not the best (Supposedly Auralic Taurus is also, and I guess BHA-1 is too for people who don't mind the extreme brightness which I personally consider unnatural)
 
At some point I even asked Dubstep Girl (Who had a few of them top headphones including the LCD-3) how come she thought that LCD-3 is bass light... She immediately told me that with her new amp (Headamp GS-X mk2) she was happy with the bass, but still preferred HE-6... oh well :)

 Skylab I believe, also has B&W 800 something fullrange speakers and his headphone preferences are also considered bass orientated cans.  I have modified a pair of professional full range towers to go down 20hz flat without the help of any subwoofer drivers and found that what comes closer to a live performance in speakers in terms of physical impact and lining up the electric bass guitar tune (I have played bass guitar with a band on many occassions in the past) with the rest of the instrumentation, I am finding even my LCD2s to be a little lite on bass in comparisons.
 
Which is worrying, because the headphones that are comparable in bass are considered fun, inaccurate or subwooferish.  It's easy to understand why when most are referencing the only other high quality source they have, namely small 2 way speakers that became the defacto standard for budget hi-fi because somewhere after the mid 90s nothing else is actually available for purchase in normal stores visited by ordinary people wanting better sound.  These people are misled into believing that bass is the enemy of hi fidelity, when in fact it is the foundation to hi fidelity.  Not an issue for niche genres and classic rock, but for music released in the past 30 years that everyone grew up with - this push is the opposite to the meaning of hi fidelity.
 
So having expressed my frustration, perhaps you should have a look into the new Fostex dynamics.  Although I feel that Audeze cans are a tad bass lite, it is completely forgivable to me due to the incredible precision and marks the emergence of a hi fi company that finally, makes philosophical sense where bass accuracy is equally as important as accuracy elsewhere in the frequency domain.
 
And no, contrary to the hi fi press, accurate, clear and concise bass flat to 20hz does not cost an arm and a leg, one needs to educate oneself and look outside of the hi fi square to do this.  But aren't 'they' supposed to do that for 'us'?  The amount of research and experimentation to get where I am now has been fun for me, but most are unable to spend this amount of time and research on something that was supposed to have been sorted out ages ago.
 
But I get the feeling that so long as people place imaginary 'imaging' and 'soundstage' as the primary factor for hi fidelity little will be done.  But congratulation are due for the hi fi industry, because they have progressed so far into this area that it has exceeded reality.  This is coming from someone that spent a good amount of money on cables, jitter and power to improve the only soundtsage that matters, the one in the recording.

Well, much to my surprise, I bought a pair of LCD3's today...
 
I went in fully intentioned on picking up a pair of HE6's.  Hifiman's just don't fit me for some reason...  The ear cups push down on the tops of my ears making them extremely uncomfortable.  I guess my head is too small or something.  Anyway, they sounded great but just for fun...
 
I tried the LCD-X's, you know, just to see.  Very nice.  Then I put on the LCD3's.  I fell in love with the bass and the overall presentation.  I liked them a lot instantly.  I'm mot a bass head but I think because they are so different sounding than my HD800's I gravitated towards them just for contrast sake.  Long story short, I took them home and I am breaking them in.  I also liking having a pair of cans with slam!
 
 

 
 
They are also waaaaaaaaaay more comfortable than I expected.  They are kind of cozy :)  But I do think the weight will be a problem long term.
 
Anyway, now on to the hunt for an amp!
 
Happy to be part of the Audeze club!

I love the Lampi -> Stratus -> HD800 combo but tubes take a while to heat up, and I don't want to leave them on for 8+ hours a day so a I "need" a SS alternative.  The reality of my life is I often listen for short periods of time except when my wife travels on business (about a week a month) and I put in some serious listening time.  The tubes will be the consolation prize for her being away.
 
I think the HD800's will always be my go to cans, but to me, they live best with tubes so a SS amp for them wasn't something that interested me (plus it was an excuse to get a new pair of headphones!!).  The LCD3's sound great with the Stratus, there is no doubt about that!  I'm thinking about a Rag, but who isn't and how long will it take to get one?  Hence the search...  Considering an M9 or something a lot more pragmatic like a NFB-28 (need a DAC too) but I really don't know.  I had my heart set on HE6's and a Krell KAV-400xi until I tried the LCD3's so I am really green when it comes to good amps with the Audezes - any advice?

I gotta say it was almost gut wrenching to send my beloved 3s off for the exchange. But I think for my taste in musical reproduction I am doing the right thing. I started with LCD2 r2 and swapped for LCD3. Looking for more air and balanced output along the whole range from bass to treble; plus more airiness in the upper mids/treble and better sound stage. Loved the bass (both phones) but I need a little more neutrality and sparkle in the highs and this seems to be a recurrent theme in the progression of headphones. The X (from many reviews) still hits hard in the lower registers with more clarity in bass to mid bass at the cost of some body but with improved detail and sparkle which I really want. Basically a more neutral presentation. Saying that though I would have liked to keep the 3s as well but alas was not really possible at this time.

Here's something funny. Lots of seats on airplanes have power now. So, I use the iPhone square plug and the Kindle cord to charge the AK240 to make sure I have enough juice.  While sitting on the ground, there is a hum that is quite noticeable with the 334s, ( I don't use the Miracles till in flight when I don't have to communicate with anyone:) and only when I touch the plug does the hum go away. Its almost like I am grounding the AK thru the plug of the 334. I also notice that I can touch metal with the plug it goes away too.
 
I'm pretty sure that once the plane takes off, the hum disappears.....electricity goes off during take off and then comes back on.  Weird, yea>?  I will confirm the hum disappears after take off next week.
 
Any ideas?
 
***Just realized this is the LCD3 thread.......oh well.......i posted on the AK also. I did not on the 334 because its a AK240 issue IMO.

Some thoughts on the X vs. the LCD3(c) or (f). Having owned the LCD3(c) and now the X, I absolutely love the X but then I loved the 3(c) as well. It is pretty obvious the X has less coloration to the dark side than does the 3; and better air/treble sparkle which is what I was looking for. It is also obvious that it would be perfectly understandable that some would prefer the presentation of the classic 3 over the X. So it really comes down to the personal preference of presentation of the individual. For me, the X ticks ALL the boxes of how I would like to hear the music presented and rendered. It would be very interesting to compare the X with the 3(f) new driver version. However I feel like I have finally reached the pinnacle of headphones performance for my taste in presentation (more neutral with excellent bass, staging, detail rendering, treble sparkle, mids, etc.) for the amount of money I am willing to spend. To go further into the realm of extreme performance from here would be many thousands more spent and realistically what I have now is perfectly awesome. This is where I wanted to be when I started with the Beyer DT990s, then LCD 2r2, then LCD3(c) then LCD-X. BUT if one desired the creamy and darker presentation of the 3(c) then it would be hard to beat the LCD3(c). Far as I am concerned the X is perfect. YMMV of course...

When I visited with an Audeze sales person he told me that they were working on an improved LCD3 but did not know if it would be denoted differently as in LCD4 and that there was definitely no plan to release it any time soon at all. He also said they were working on a lower cost headphone which would be released in the near future. So they are likely targeting the bigger market share available to potential buyers looking to step up to at least mid-fi from such widely available at Best Buy etc. IMHO between the LCD3(f) and the X, there are two really awesome headphones that even though [allegedly] are not up to Stax standards, are undeniably extremely fine products. Along with a few select others, this offering of headphones available makes this a really good time to be an audiophile! Choice is a good thing... My choice was the X but I could be happy as a clam with a LCD3(f) also. It all comes down to what musical presentation the individual desires.

I've had the 009 for a couple of years but am just now getting really credible bass thanks to a cap mod (Mundorf) to my DIY 6SN7 amp (based on the Stax design but done right in terms of power supply regulation etc. - more like the T2 than the T1 in that regard). And I was amazed to hear how much bass the Lambdas have when driven with that amp; listened to Patricia Barber - no more upward tilt on the voice. Not so very different from the 009 tonally. The 007s of course are very different. Their bass is a bit too prominent now and the mids a bit too rich with that amp. They sound better with the higher voltage swing of EL34s.
 
Recently I bought the LCD-3F. The Lambdas actually produce more low bass now than the 3F. Maybe there's an amp that will pull more low bass out of the 3F than the one I'm using (a balanced hybrid design with 6H30s in the input stage, also DIY, both built by a friend). But they sound great otherwise (using a very low capacitance DIY silver cable - forget the stock cable). Midrange to die for. The 009 is still more revealing, sunnier, more "Kodachrome", and with those amazing highs. The very different presentations of the 009 and the 3F are nicely complementary. The "truth" might be somewhere in between, but that headphone doesn't exist AFAIK. And maybe could never exist, as the different technologies of orthos and electrostats do seem to impose their own sets of limitations. (Though I haven't heard the Abyss.)
 
I also auditioned the LCD-X in my system, but finally they left me cold (too "Ektachrome"). Too bad the 3F doesn't have their bass extension and slam though! I've read many opinions that the X's mids are more neutral the the 3F's, but I don't hear that - at least with acoustic music there's something deadened about their sound, some vibrancy lacking, that seems typical of otherwise very good dynamic headphones. Possibly, technically, the 3F mids aren't quite as neutral (do the FR graphs show anything that would suggest that?), and maybe the 3F does beautify sound to some extent by rolling off the highs a bit more than the X (?), but in the end it's the emotional connection to the music that really counts, and there, for me, the 3F scores. That might also be partly because the 3F produces more fine timbral/textural detail than the X in an audiophile system. Instrumental overtones sound more there. The X outlines sound more (not to the point of "etch" but in that direction compared to the 3F), but it doesn't fill it in as well.

Removing the foam suits my preferences and my system too. And agree with all your comments about the change in sound. Except the high frequencies are more extended and natural with my tube amp. I was running my LCD-3 with just the grill in place, no foam. IMO, with no science to back it up, dust should not be very much of a problem as the rear of the driver has what looks like wool sandwiched between the diaphragm and fazor. Plus orthodynamics are not like electrostatics and actively attract dust.
Had to return them to Audeze last Thursday as the connector housing on the left earpod was loose and falling out. Could have glued it myself, but then Audeze would not know about the quality issue possibly take corrective action on future production.
If you have a simple ohm meter, one can easily measure the DCR of driver. Even so, by the sounds of it, you more than likely have had the 110 ohm drivers installed with fazors when serviced by Audeze. Removing the foam with the 45 ohm drivers in my previous LCD-3C was terribly disappointing.
The LCD-3F are definitely more open and less muddy after removing the foam. They have me wondering if I really need a Stax rig. Edited by Jones Bob - 7/26/14 at 1:18pm

@Badas
 
I am using a LCD3(F) with a WA7/WA7tp as one of my combination. As the LCD3(F) & WA7tp are fairly recent purchases, I have not really made up my mind yet. Don't get me wrong, as they are, that combination sound great already. For a more sustained period, I have been mainly listening to the WA7 with a Beyerdynamic T1 as my main set-up and this combination is great too. Between the two, I will not go as far as to try to conclude which is better. They do sound substantially different and I guess it boils down to a matter of preference and probably also to the genres of music that one listens through them.
 
For me, the LCD3(F) seems to be a warmer sounding headphone with a better bass punch than the T1 (I am not much of a basshead and I have only briefly demo-ed to the LCD3 <without the Fazor> when it was hooked up to a Fostex DAC/Amp at a Headphone Festival; so I cannot comment on the previous LCD3). With the WA7/WA7tp, I find the LCD3(F) not as revealing as the T1 in comparison. I enjoy both headphones tremendously.
 
I have also plugged in the LCD3(F) to my solid state Musical Fidelity M1-SDAC and I find that this makes up for some of the details have been missing with the WA7/WA7tp but as a trade-off, it loses some of the warmth that I had previously talked about. I have a sneaky feeling the LCD3(F) may fare better with a solid state amplifier for some people who may crave for a "slightly brighter" sound.
 
Overall, I am still more than happy to have the LCD3(F) paired with the WA7/WA7tp as one of my main set-ups.

Hey, excellent mini-write. It is very helpful.
Can you give me a few basic answers to these questions:
1. Is the WA7 powerful enough for the LCD3's?
I really like the WA7's look and footprint ( space is a commodity). However I have concerns it is a bit of a toy and not a real amp. I think I am wrong tho as all the reviews say otherwise.
My sound signature is more bass and I hate treble so I think the WA7 LCD 3 combo would be great for me. A side point I have recently had a hearing test and I heard up to 31K. Very high. That is why treble annoys me it is because I can hear those notes others can't. Most of the time those notes are distorting.
2. Compared to your solid state amp does the WA7 have a tube sound?
I really think tube sound is what suits my preferred sound signature. Again I have concerns the WA7 is trying to be neutral like a solid state amp instead of a classic tube amp. I think once again I am wrong. A lot of reviews have commented on that lack of brightness (yay) and warm deep sound ( yay again).

I am new to headgear. Only a couple of months. However I have 25 years experience with top level Home Theatre gear. In the couple of months I have collected the Senny HD700, LCD3 and Oppo HA-1. I'm starting to run out of $$ however I think I will also get a WA7,
Kinda going of track. Yes I was attracted to the LCD3 as well. I started with the HD700 and altho it brang a smile to my face I had to EQ the crap out of it as it was very bright. As soon as I got the LCD3 it was game over. Deep bass nice tight mid range and relaxed treble. The treble is still there in a lot of ways I think it is more detailed than the HD700. The treble just doesn't get out of control and not the focus.
I also listened to the LCD2. First time I heard I nearly yelled horray in the shop. Same sound signature. Then I put on the LCD 3. Boom. I had to have. Same signature as LCD 2 but add wider soundstage and detail.
All the comments you have read about the Audeze sound signature are accurate. If that is the type of sound you are looking for it will deliver.Edited by Badas - 8/2/14 at 2:09pm

Consider this to be a dissenting view on the gungnir. The Gungnir to me sounds harsh with very little refinement to it. I haven't lived with it, but only heard it (and some of their other dacs) at meets which admittedly isn't the best way to audition gear. But for the money you can do better than the Gungnir. A headphone vendor that goes to lots of meets had two setups, one of which was with big $ type of stuff and the other which was with a M/G stack. When listening to the two setups he even apologized or the Gungnir saying that the Mjolnir was pretty good but the Gungnir was harsh and he was going to replace it with something else.
 
If you are looking for a USB dac then take a hard look at the new iFi micro iDSD. It works very well and sounds far more refined than its price point would suggest. It's built in headphone amp is very good but you would probably want to eventually add another one for desktop use. Even without its headphone section it would be worth twice its price as a dedicated dac. With its built in battery and headphone amp it's a homerun. 
 
M/G would be a chunk to carry around when traveling.
 
Consider for travel (ascending in price:)
 
iFi micro iDSD      - $500
CEntrance hfi M8  - $700
Chord Hugo          - $2000
 
The iFi and Chord can drive headphones directly  and are also equally at home in a stationary desktop system as really good DACs. M/G is a bit much to consider carrying around on a regular basis.

@Badas I don't know whether to say "wow" or "ouch" to your ability to hear up to 31K. To answer your questions:
 
1) The WA7 is more than powerful enough for any high impedance big cans (or low impedance IEMs with the alternative headphone jack) despite its small footprint. I usually have the volume knob up to the 9 or 10 O'Clock positions for most of my listening sessions. And you're right about it being a good-looker, less so about it being perhaps more like a toy than an amp. A bona fide amp it is, but less so a DAC as this can be slightly on the rough side. I don't have any issues with treble distortion as perhaps the grand old age of 44 has made me unable to discern the higher registers ha ha ha.
 
2) My limited experience makes me unable to commit to saying the WA7 does have a tube sound. About a year ago, I bought the WA7 as my entry into the world of tube amps. It doesn't offer much in terms of tube rolling though, with probably only two 6C45 variants to choose from. The WA7tp which I have recently added does offer a few more choices of 12AU7 tubes to choose from though (but this should be discussed in another thread).
 
Does the WA7 have a tube sound? I cannot say that conclusively.
Is it trying to be neutral like a solid state amp? I think there are discernible differences from the solid state amps I have had experience with.
 
To bring this thread back fully to the LCD3 (F/C) focus, I think the LCD3(F) pairs remarkably with the WA7/WA7tp. After my previous post, I went back to A/B the LCD3(F) and the T1 through the WA7/WA7tp with some of my favourite tracks. What I can say at this point in time is that I am leaning more and more towards the LCD3(F). 
 
You cannot really go wrong with the LCD3(F) / WA7 / WA7tp combination if warm bass, lush mids and not too overly bright are what you are looking for.
We can only try to have different combinations to play with in the future. Let's enjoy the ride together.

Yeah, I have been wondering that. Look the LCD-3 is going to be my focus. I love it.
 
I was looking at the WA2 which is supose to have a very tubey sound. However I have been told it is not powerful enough. Specs say 310mw @ 32ohms. WA7 is 1000mw @ 32ohms (more than 3 times powerful).
The other is the WA6SE. 2000mw @ 32ohms (2 times more powerful than the WA7). Then I was told it was bright. Yuck.
 
My Oppo is 3000mw @ 32ohms. A friggin monster.
 
I have organized a WA7 trial tonight. I will see. I also might pop Woo a email to see what they say.
 
All the focus will be on getting the best for the LCD-3. I even think I will part with my Senny HD700. I can't see me using them. Not liked around here but I might become a one headphone owner. To me the LCD-3 is end game.

 
Yeah, you would think so.
However I listen to SACD and DVD Audio and there is no treble distortion. However and this is hard to explain, those high treble notes go so high it gives me a headache (others wouldn't hear those notes). If I EQ to roll off treble or lower the impact I don't get a headache. Those high notes is like what makes dogs go crazy. Same result.
 
Because I hear so high I naturally need a lazy laid back treble or a roll off.
 
It is not throwing away a third of the sound. It is saving my sanity.

That's very cool that you have good high frequency hearing. It's something to be happy about, not upset.
Again, there is almost zero chance that because you can hear above 20 kHz that this is what makes you "hate treble". There just isn't enough sound pressure level in that range for it to be an issue.
Note that even the harmonics of cymbals end at 16 kHz. The fundamental ends much lower. Things like a piccolo and piano have their highest notes under 4 kHz.
If treble in music bothers you, you need to make sure you're chasing the right solution. Being able to hear above 20 kHz isn't going to cause an enhanced sensitivity to treble in music. They physics just doesn't work that way.
Point is: you probably need to find a headphone where the treble response OVERALL is shelved down. Just finding one with a very rolled off top end likely isn't going to help.Edited by Skylab - 8/3/14 at 4:03pm

Well, I just joined the club and wanted to post somewhere .... I guess this is the place.  Usually, when I get a new toy (especially, an expensive new toy), when it first comes out of the box I tend to look for the extremes .... so this is supposed to be "the best", huh?  Well, what's wrong with it.  And where's the wow factor?  What knocks my socks off?
 
 
At first listen, I thought ..... hmmm.... there is nothing WRONG with these.... they sound GREAT!   After some critical listening I though that something is rolled off somewhere at the top end..... these just don't have the BITE that some of my other phones have.
But the bass is to die for.
 
 
After longer listening, I realized they are just perfectly tuned though.  That missing bite is a virtue.   No longer do I have to switch headphones for different genres, bit rates, or mastering quality.  Everything is rendered full and clear.... I can resolve the individual instruments even in cluttered passages.
 
BTW, I'm playing these out of a Conductor.

Super-short summary from someone who has heard the LCD-3C & LCD-X and owns the LCD-3F: (as usual, all of this is IMHO - personal experience can and will vary!)
 
1. Treble - Addition of the Fazor's very nearly closes the gap on the high-end that the LCD-X's had over the LCD-3C's. The Fazors give the LCD-3F's additional resolution in the upper frequencies, although with the LCD-X's it's hard to tell if this is due to them being different in construction/voicing or just the fact that they also have the Fazors! (Please realized that the increased treble is a relative thing, these are still Audeze cans and not HD-800s). WINNER = TIE
2. Bass - The LCD-X's still have a very slight edge over the LCD-3's (C or F variant) in the low end. Their is more bass, although this is truly an incremental thing - all the Audeze's kill in this area. It's not bass-head "boom-boom-boom" but it is very present, controlled and accurate. WINNER = LCD-X's
3. Mids - Here's where the LCD-3's pull away from the pack, both the C and F versions. While the X's have a very solid mid-range, I found they lacked the "magic" of the LCD-3's. This is harder to describe fully, you just have to experience it. They presence of the music, the duration of the notes, the fine detail - it's all amazing. WINNER = LCD-3's
 
OVERALL WINNER (again IMO) = LCD-3F's!!! I really liked the LCD-X's all around, but with the LCD-3F's it was true love (and still is). 
 
Note 1 = I actually didn't know I was getting the LCD-3F's - when I ordered they had not announced the Fazor roll-out. I just got lucky and was one of the first to get them. They really are awesome. 
 
Note 2 = All of these cans were driven by the same Burson Conductor, which I found did them justice all around. Amp-headphone synergy can make a real difference. 
 
Hope that's useful!

Just looked it up. What a great amp. Beautiful. You must be proud.

 
Interesting. I've been hovering around the Woo site for a while. So close to pushing go.
 
I would love to get the WA 22 however it is outside my price range. Just to much right now. The balance outputs would be fun to play with.
I am newish to this and I don't want to offend anyone, however does the balance outputs not make any difference unless the whole chain source to HP is also balanced?
I have the Oppo HA-1 and LCD-3 and tried the balance output from that. Other than a loudness gain I didn't notice much.
 
I am very close to pushing go on the WA2. I know there are comments that it is underpowered. I can't understand that myself. Why has Woo made something so big and not have power???
It has a 120W transformer so there must be some power in the unit somewhere.
The reasons why I'm looking at the WA2 is that I took a WA7 for a overnight trial (Thanks Computer Lounge. Very generous). I was very disappointed with the whole thing. Nearly threw away the whole getting a tube amp idea. It sounded like a solid state amp. I gave the edge to the Oppo. Better soundstage and mid-range. If I am going to buy a tube amp I want it to sound like a tube amp. Not accurate at all.
 
From what I have read the WA2 and 22 are the right type of amps. The WA6SE is the same price and a lot more powerful however the comments of brighter and not as smooth as the WA2 has put me off.
 
Being a Woo owner do you think I will be okay with the WA2?
 

 
Yes it does help a lot. So tubes don't dark up the LCD-3 too much.
 
I started with the Senny HD700. Gosh they were too bright. I then hunted down the LCD-3. Boom. I love the sound signature. I had all sorts of EQ on the HD700. Now I have turned it all off. Just enjoying the LCD-3 warmth. Guess my question came from fear that tubes might just push the LCD-3 into the too warm / dark area.

 
Thanks. Whatever tube amp I go for I will experiment with the tubes to get that quality.
 
I plan to send all my sources to the Oppo HA-1 (iPod, CD, SACD and DVD Audio), let the DAC decode then send on to a tube amp. Then I could pick and choose what amp to use depending on the music.

In my experience with the LCDs they benefit more from higher current output with the power tubes on wa22 (ts7236, ts5998, chatham 2399 types) and the balanced design allow sufficient output to drive LCD3 very well. Specs is just part of the story as my audio-gd amp which does 8W @40ohms didn't drive it better than my wa22.
Re the balanced design for wa22, the key is to use the balanced xlr inputs. The outputs are all the same and are there for convenient purpose. There is not really much to gain for using balanced or SE headphone cable from the WA22. Other amps could be different and require the balanced out to utilize the full balanced circuit. For the current wa22, while it will allow the use of its full circuitry and deliver full power with either the xlr or rca inputs, with rca single ended inputs the signal will be passed to a phase splitter circuit first and I find the xlr inputs more transparent sounding.
I haven't spent enough time with wa2 to recommend for/against it.

So what you said in that post is that you liked the SS better than the WA2 tube??
 
In ways your setup is not to dis similar to mine. Oppo HA-1.
 
Both are SS. Class A with plenty of power. Sure yours has a separate DAC, where mine is a all in one unit. So yours would have less supposed distortion.
 
Do I really need to look at tubes? What is to be gained from them?
 
So confused.  Everyone has told me that I haven't heard music until I've heard it using tubes. I feel like I'm missing something. Maybe I'm not. The Oppo HA-1 into LCD-3 sounds like a dream. Yet I'm still curious.
 
I've tried the Oppo Balanced output. Very nice. There is a large volume increase using it. I did some listening between Balance and 1/4 inch re-adjusting the volume. I couldn't hear a quality gain just the obvious volume gain. I decided just to use 1/4 inch.
 
Also last night I noticed when I was using my LCD-3's that on occasion when I turned my heads they were making a clicking sound. Not drivers. Something else. On inspection afterwards I noticed the key bolt that holds the black steel frame to the wood was lose on the left back side. I grabbed a key and tightened. Seemed to fix. However after checking the rest one is just spinning round and round and not tightening. Should I be concerned? The one that is spinning is not causing any problems and seems to connect well.
 

 
Looked up that also. Some of you guys have some outstanding gear. I take my hat off to you all.

Yes different amps are different 're whether the balanced headphone out is different than the se headphone out. Amps from makers like audio-gd or little dot all require the balanced headphone out to utilize the full power of their amps.
WA22 is kinna unique in this that you enjoy same power output regardless which headphone out you use. To me it is a benefits as I don't need to get balanced cables for every headphone (or to be used with ones that can't be balanced without major mods like AKG K812pro).

If you are considering the WA22 you should factor the cost of tubes upgrades. The upgrade suggestions at woo is good with LCD3 imho but a bit expensive at their price. You should be able to find them for less than $400 total from eBay or other sellers. You can keep an eye on the trade forum here for some nice deals also. The main Woo thread here is also great place to start researching for tubes for the Woo of your choice.

Hi DC5Zilla,
 
From your photos  it seems to be the two adjustment blocks aren't screwed down in the straight-ahead position, that is, parallel to the side of your head.
 
Refer to the Comfort Guide here: http://www.audeze.com/headphone-comfort-guide  
 
See the second row, 2nd and 3rd images, that's the adjusting block through which the rods slide up and down to fit your head. If the blocks aren't aligned it may be the simple explanation for why you're having problems.
 
If you can't position the blocks so they're not "toed-in" or "toed-out" it might then be a problem with the yokes in which case your first move should be to first contact your dealer. If there's a problem you can always email support@auduze.com.
 
Keep us in touch DC5Zilla and if you don't mind message us here on Head-Fi about where you're located. 
 
Regards
Audeze

+1 to DC5Zilla. 
 
If you paid $50 for a set of cans and they had to be tweaked a little bit to be aligned then no big deal. However, plunk down $2K for a "reference" headphone and you shouldn't have to worry about it coming to you in any state other than perfect. If it's otherwise then back it should go. If you bought a Lambo/Porsche/Ferrari and it pulled to the left when the dealer delivered it, I'm sure all of us would send it back until the alignment was completely dialed-in. 
 
Having run manufacturing lines in my earlier days this type of defect is very easy to screen for - just put them on a stand (as you all have done) and see if they sit evenly. But even before they're assembled the metal tab should be checked after it is bent - just put it in a jig and measure the angles - easy to do. And finally given that the LCD-3's ship in a hard travel case they're not going to get tweaked in transit. 
 
Hold the line on QC. Just because they're hand-made doesn't mean they shouldn't come to you in the "near-perfect" state. And finally Audeze has always been good to their word (if not better) in my dealings with them, so don't hesitate to ask them for what you need to be totally happy with their awesome products. 
 
Happy listening and have a great Labor Day weekend

It's not that strong to me, and I have a big head.  I don't mind the clamping at all, and since it's not uncomfortable it only serves to make a good seal and keep it firmly in place.  The latter is needed since it's not at the featherweight end of the scale...  The pads are very comfortable to me and completely go around my ears, which is part of why I don't think the clamping bothers me.  In fact, I find them very comfortable.  I also don't move around a lot, mostly I just sit or lie with a laptop.  The leather pads might get a little sweaty on a hot day (I live in SF and we usually only get half a dozen hot days per year).
 
There's only one minor thing I've noticed, and that's when I lie down with them on.  The pivot bolt in the back gets pushed up, tilting the headband forwards.  Not a big deal, but making this flush would get my vote.

Hey Guys,

Just had my bran New LCD3's (fazors) arrive and unfortunately they are so bent (left hand side C frame) that you cant even wear them.......
 
I have never been so disappointed and emailed Audeze with an extremely unhappy email. I have been waiting for these to come for about 2 weeks now and if i have to send these back to the NZ seller i am talking about another 2 weeks of waiting for a replacement pair.
 
Have attached photo, its so bent the paint has actually split which causes all the pressure of the headband to be applied to the top of the headphone and leaves a 1cm gap at the bottom of my ear.
 

 
Just awaiting to see what Audeze comes back with. How did they miss this on quality control? as DC5 said this is a god dam 2000 dollar set of headphones.

For dac/amp, I was only using Hugo to test that day as it was my setup. I travel a lot as my wife is from Malaysia, so we go to see her family on regular basis. At the time of testing, I didn't bother with other set-up.
 
Before I demo these cable, I was very skeptic about all this after market cable changes bla bla bla... Thinking it should not be so much different to justify the crazy prices they charge. Anyway, I say to myself, let me be the judge of it and try it myself with my own gear to eliminate other variables. I brought my own LCD-3f and my Chord Hugo, my own MBP retina and my own music hard drive to the dealer. I own an IT company and love photography so traveling with tons of gears and electronics is a daily thing. :)
 
When I demo something, I tend not to worry so much about the technical details. More on how much I like my music coming from it. I listen to variety of music depending on my moods so I tested on genre except heavy metal which is not my cup of tea.
 
The sound I get from my LCD-3f through Silver Dragon V3 was a bit more open, smoother flow of musical sounds (compare to stock) which I like. To my ear, I hear only very slightly colored upper mid/lower-hi to the already colored LCD-3f. Didn't feel like it change much, which is a good thing. Its like listening to old radio (stock cable) and listening to the same song on a proper stereo. Overall, it was a very good cable that make music more enjoyable. If I didn't compare it with Heimdall2, I would've already bought it.
 
The Silver Poison through the LCD-3f was much more open at the top end. It has the wow factor that slightly brighter sounds giving feeling of more details and space. If you like this type of sounds, then its great. Then I would get the HD800 instead. The main issue I have with the Silver Poison to my ears is that, it change the smooth yummy mids too much. It colored too much of the LCD-3f's mids characteristics that, to me, it lost the wonderful fluid musical sounds I love about this headphones. The bottom line is, the music did not sound smooth and pleasing to me.
 
Then I tried the Heimdall2 and everything about the same music I listened to on previous cables changes. The stage is wide open, the music sounds smooth, and most importantly, it is the most musical sounding. Music just comes naturally. The details are much better in a sense that it was there but not punching you in the face. The mids is very natural, seductively smooth that bring out the best character of the LCD-3f. Chie Ayado's opening track of Good Life album, When The World Turns Blue, is stuck in my head and I can't get it out. Its like drug that I want to go home and listen to her unique voice everyday. On other cable I felt that I was getting 50% valued of the headphone and questioned my own sanity as to why spend so much and only getting this little. So I spend another 800$ and now I feel like I have a 100,000$ sound system. With this cable, I feel like my 2000$ was worth every penny.
 
Although after having Heimdall2, I demo it with other amp like Conductor, Aurorasounds Heada (no discussion about this amp in Head-fi, but man! its the best sounding of this lot), Oppo HA-1, Schiit Vahalla 2 (which surprisingly sounded great for its price range with LCDs), and Bakoon HPA-21.
 
I really hate to admit that a cable can make so much difference, but it does. I know some people here will not agree with me, but please go try it yourself with open mind. Whether you feel the % improvement justify the prices or not is irrelevant. Price/Satisfaction is subjective. Everyone goes wow and probably bought their LCDs when demoing with an aftermarket cables anyway. Just my 2 cent. :)

I use my Toxic Silver Widow first with LCD3C and now with LCDX. I can't hear a really marked difference between it and the stock cable (balanced) but possibly a bit cleaner on the top end and down low also. On the X the bass is incredibly tight and well defined and FAST. The Silver Widow does not hurt at all. The treble is crystal clear and airy sounding as well with this cable, much more so than was the 3c. Which of course was one of the main reasons the X came along was I was craving a little more neutral presentation all along the spectrum while maintaining the awesome bass. Which is exactly what happened... Mids are still beautifully presented with the Silver Widow without a hint of glare or harshness that I can detect. Deep bass is no longer kind of muddy sounding as it was with the LCD3c. That I cannot tolerate at all. So I guess I could say the Silver Widow was a worthwhile addition to my system. Sure does look nice too and it is very lightweight too. With the Toxic Silver Widow my X hits hard and fast and CLEAN down low, sings out those mids so fine, and treble is wonderfully detailed, clear, airy, with transients handled just incredibly well and quite improved sound staging as well. I can only imagine what a really top-flight amp and especially dac may contribute . Although not exactly slummin' with my M/G stack at all. In fact everything is presented quite nicely with my little system no complaints at all. Many hundreds of hours of listening have proved to be worth every penny spent on my gear, cable included.

No it had somewhat muddy bass when rocking hard and loud down low. That was only on certain selections but it was more than that. The coloration or "darkness" or whatever yielded to the more neutral presentation of the X... For me it was a correct move. Still the same Audeze goodness just a little more neutral and truthful to the music. IMHO. Now I am NOT bashing the LCD3 classic or fazor. The 3 is an awesome headphone end of story. BUT I wanted a bit more neutral presentation while maintaining all the good points of the Audeze house sound and -hello- THAT IS THE X! So for me I am ecstatic with the X and if I had the 3f I would also be perfectly happy but always wondering how the X sounded... So I found out. It is awesome. Like blondes or brunettes... There are incredibly beautiful specimens of each. So what do ya want? (I like brunettes personally).  ;0)

isquirrel - Here's what I said on this thread previously regarding the 3F's vs. the X's. Thanks - 
 
Super-short summary from someone who has heard the LCD-3C & LCD-X and owns the LCD-3F: (as usual, all of this is IMHO - personal experience can and will vary!)
 
1. Treble - Addition of the Fazor's very nearly closes the gap on the high-end that the LCD-X's had over the LCD-3C's. The Fazors give the LCD-3F's additional resolution in the upper frequencies, although with the LCD-X's it's hard to tell if this is due to them being different in construction/voicing or just the fact that they also have the Fazors! (Please realized that the increased treble is a relative thing, these are still Audeze cans and not HD-800s). WINNER = TIE

Just an educated guess based on usual number of hours it morphs into seemingly every time I listen. Plus used for webinars, training audio and video, and meditation as well so ya lots of hours accumulate. In fact thinking about it 300 hours may well be a low ball estimate. Anyway they continue to get noticeably better and better. I had the LCD3c and wanted a tad bit more neutrality all along the spectrum with more air and treble. Initially I was concerned as the Xdid not seem to have the magic mids of the 3c, but as time goes on the X are found to be just as magical as were my 3c cans. Heavy rock has the bass slam just incredible with transient response, attack, and decay just sublime. But importantly the rendering of all other genres is exemplary too. Listening to Norah Jones and the magic rolls on...

It is cool, when I used to be part of the setup crew for CES we had numerous rooms to have to setup our speakers in, so we would take detailed notes before setup, including measurements, SP levels, equipment used etc etc and then go back at the end of the day and do a check listen and re-tune if necessary, usually something would have changed because of a number of factors, component burn in or change or equipment, or because people had moved the speakers..... 
 
Was interesting how much the sound would change over the course of a few days. Last night of the CES was always the best time to listen. Was the only way I could do customer setups because for sure they would invariably tinker and then want to know what the setup was when I had left them. We would draw out their listening rooms and take all measurements before and after setup.
 
It became a very important tool.

LCD-3 and T1 are very different. 
 
Right now I have the perfect amp for the T1 (SPL Auditor) but less then perfect one for the LCD-3 (Schitt Vali), so my comparaison is probably unfair. I'm looking into buying an amp for the LCD-3, but I don't know yet what to get.
 
 
T1
LCD-3
Treble
Detailed, impressive, clear and sharp, can be sibilant sometime
Soft, precise, never sibilant
Bass
Fast, impressive, lot of slam, much more bass then the DT880 and extend lower. 
Deep, rounded, 
Mid
Clear, in your face presentation
realistic, lay back
Acoustic
Clear, sharp, you get every details
You get all the details, but more in the background. Lifelike?
Voice
Really good sometime and other time not
More forgiving, really nice and rounded. I think it's where the LCD-3 shine. 
Classical
Lifeless but detailed
Overall good, but less detailed
Soundstage
Huge soundstage without being artificial. The T1 really shine here.
Smaller, more like the DT-880. Compared to the T1, it's poor.
Details
Lots of details, if there is a glitch you will notice it easily
Much more forgiving, everything is there, but not in your face.
Day to day
Fun if you like to listen to every details, I do. Very comfortable even after many hours.
Easy to listen to. Engaging headphone. 
 
Many here will disagree, and I agree to disagree, it's just my opinion on both of them. Note that I spend much more time with the T1 and my LCD-3 are still "burning in" (read my ears are still adapting to it's sound signature, I don't buy into burning and cable stuff). To answer your question do they stack close? Yes, they are both really nice headphone, but at the same time very different. If you buy the T1, I guess at first you won't like them, it did the same with the LCD-3, they are so different. 
 
An other fun thing that say how different they are, most people with the T1 try to find an amp with tube warm sound to "remove" sibilance and gain on bass. Those with the LCD-3 say they prefer SS because it bring treble and more details. On my side I'm at the opposite, I have the T1 with a SS and I try to find a warm amp for the LCD-3 (considering the woo 6 or woo 22). When I want all the details I go for the T1 (but it's hard doing something else, you just want to focus on everything, it so incredible), when I want to relax I go for the LCD-3. 
 
I would say that the LCD-X is closer to the T1, probably a good balance between both. My guess is that the LCD-X is the best Audeze headphone right now, they could have named it LCD-4 and everybody would have say how better it is to the LCD-3, but by doing so, it would have been hard to continue to sell the LCD-3 full price, so instead they call it their "flagship". Then why I went with the LCD-3F? Because I wanted something as far apart from the T1. 
 
  
=============================================
Topic: 10930686 in thread 588429
=============================================


Keep that in mind, and once you will get the T1 it will blow it ;) Please note that my choice of amp (SPL Auditor) make it sound that way (very analytical) and that's the way I wanted it. SPL do professional equipment, not audiophile one. It's more like a "no ********" approach. It sound the way it is. If the record is sibilant, they will sound sibilant, if it's well recorded, it sound amazing. 
 
To me a well recorded track on the T1 + SPL sound very very impressive, way more then anything else. But a poorly recorded track sound painful. It's not the way it's supposed to be? If a sibilant record sound nice, to me it's because those headphone and/or amplifier is not able to reproduce some frequency and there is something lacking, other call it a "sound signature".
 
If you can grab the T1 for $600-$700 used, I would say, go for it. Spend sometime with it. You may like it very much or not.
 
I would compare the T1 to a precision tool and the LCD-3 to a piece of art.

I can now confirm that the Auditor is a better match then the Vali for the LCD 3F. The Auditor have plenty of power to spare, you can drive the LCD-3F very very loud and I'm at 50% only on the amp and it's still sound clear. For sure the input is pretty strong since it,s a balanced signal. The bass is very controlled, it sound great with most music genre. But now I'm stuck with my T1 again on my head... It's have been 5 weeks since I have hear them, and wow, they still impress me like the first time.
 
I will report more as I spend more time with it, but so far the Vali doesn't have enough power to control the LCD-3F correctly, the auditor does, but it sound pretty analytical. 
 
Track like Linkin Park http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScNNfyq3d_w are stellar with the T1, but lack clarity on the LCD-3F. Vocal, Jazz, Blues are better on the LCD-3F. The soundstage is better as well with the Auditor, but the T1 still win on this. Instrument separation have also improved quite a bit, but again the T1 here really shine, in busy track like Linkin Park you can clearly hear the difference.
 
Ho, and the T1 are sooo comfortable. I did not remember how light they were.

I doubt it. In my case as with others, its the xlr connector faulty, not the driver itself. The xlr connector coming off for us is simply come down to bad design. There's nothing holding the xlr and the wood together except small dab of glue which seems to be easily cracked (think rice glue). There should be some sort of hook or mechanism that keep the connector in place.
 
Burning-in equipment is done at low volume, mostly lower than our normal usage. I've been burning in equipment since 1986 when I got my first (not Dad's hand-me-down) system. My dad's Kensonic (now a days, you know it as Accuphase) amp and JBL speakers (which he also burned over 20 years ago) still worked fine, but he gave it away couple years ago. I never had an equipment failure, or even heard of failure due to burning in. It would be very poor quality product if we had to limit our usage of expensive headphones to certain number of hours per day / week / year else it will fail.
 
Nordost provide free service to burn-in their cables, I was told by our dealer, that it can put years of constant usage in the 1 week burn-in with their dedicated machine. BTW, Nordost recommends at least 200 hours burn-in period.

Shortly after Audez'e introduced their "fazor" technology in 2013 with their new LCD-X and LCD-XC headphones, they added the tech to their existing LCD-2 and LCD-3 models as well.
Head-fiers developed a couple of short-hands to refer to these 'new' models, 2F and 3F being one of the most popular.
The models these replaced - especially the LCD3 revered by many for its sub-bass - started to be referred to as the "classic" models. Thus were the 2C and 3C 'born'.
That's it. There are other distinctions within the 'C' range., e.g. the LCD2.1 aka LCD2 r1, followed by the LCD2.2/2r2 etc. IIRC we got up to 2.3 or 2.4  Whatever, the progression would be something like LCD2.1, 2.2, 2.3,.., 2F
There was an earlier veiled version of the LCD3C rapidly replaced by the unveiled version which met the standard originally intended by Audez'e (according to a release they made at the time!).
I'm not aware of a particular nomenclature for these (I didn't own a 3 until I bought the 3F earlier this year).
The Gungnir/Mjolnir stack has a fine reputation among many with the 2 and 3C. I understand the F models - I assume you're getting a 3F - do sound a little different from the Cs so your impressions of the G/M/3F combination will be appreciated.

In a conversation I had with Audeze, I was told that unlike a conventional speaker cone, the LCD drivers do not change with age. Aside from "running in" with a conventional cone, there is a continual albeit gradual ongoing change throughout the life of the headphone. In contrast the planar drives are entirely static. Audeze test each pair for some hours before it is shipped...or at least they did in the past.
 
I don't want to open a can of worms here, but my own experience as a musician is that my LCD-3Cs sound exactly the same now as they did when I first got them. I don't believe they changed or improved in some kind of running in phase. It is accepted by some that the brain is what adjusts, not the headphones changing. I know some absolutely believe the LCDs change/improve with age, and I am not intending to discredit as I have no means of knowing truly what is going on with these drivers, but I wanted to present what Audeze told me nonetheless.

It boggles my mind when people talk about brain burn-in. How does my brain getting used to the sound make it sound any different? I usually do what sandab describes above. When I plug in a new component, and the sound isn't to my liking, I plug it and let it play for a couple of days to a week. Then I give it a listen, and more often than not, the sound has changed for the better. If it hasn't, I repeat said process.
 
Was my brain letting the new unfavorable sound burn into it while I was away? Not possible, because I wasn't listening to it continuously all along....captain obvious, right? Now, let's say for kicks that I did listen during this period, and the sound became more palatable over time, why would this now be brain burn-in? So what do we call what happens if we don't listen? This brain burn-in premise also suggests that any off-putting sound only requires some brain burn-in for one to love it. I guess if I don't love the treble of my new cans, all I need to do is visit my local zoo and listen to screeching monkeys all day, and upon my return home, my new headphone's distorted treble would sound like a singing angel? No it won't....

^ Despite a previous recent comment I don't belong to any "brain burn-in school" (is there one?) and I don't have a strong position about it. It's just a speculation others have had that fits with stuff on the periphery of my field. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if it's the wrong explanation. Nevertheless, here are a few comments.
adamaley I think you make a good point that (at first sight) it shouldn't work if not listening continuously, although I wouldn't necessarily underestimate the impact of even brief exposure for the brain to know quite a lot of "what it's up against". Our brains have quite a lot of processing power and - to adopt your colorful example - how long does one need to hear a screeching monkey to learn its major features? Enough to know the difference between it and almost everything else we hear?
To the key point "how does my brain getting used to the sound make it sound any different?", it's a property of learning. One might equally ask how does repeated exposure to anything make one better (or sometimes worse) at it? This doesn't mean the sound coming to ones ears has changed. It's perception that changes: what one notices and doesn't notice.
One example might be a brighter (or darker) headphone that reveals 'detail' one didn't previously notice or listen for. Once one has heard this (and in particular has started to hear the full palette of new detail involved) it's not something one can unlearn. Subsequently, one might avoid such a headphone, or make it an absolute essential of any future one.
The other point that "any off-putting sound only requires some brain burn-in...", maybe, maybe not. If one really dislikes an hp (say), there are few reasons to continue listening to it (one might be that one already paid for the thing ). OTOH if one dislikes one aspect but likes other aspects a lot there's motivation to continue. Liking most aspects means only a small amount of brain remapping is needed. This adjustment period might be an acceptable 'cost'.
The idea of visiting screeching monkeys could be a good test of the hypothesis and is entertaining and colorful. Anyone care to try this and report back? Could become the new audiophile treatment du jour... (Or what about some badly mastered pop - there's plenty around )
This is all FWIW and speculation. I'm not aware of any research specific to this, I'm just generalising from (what I know of) learning and perception. It might be wrong to generalise it to the audiophile context.
Alternatively, there might be learning, hardware burn-in and other stuff going on. It's rare in my field to find a single cause for anything. Instead it's usually combinations of many different factors.

I used to live near a river where every morning, a long-tailed taxi boat would race down the river waking me up. After several months in that condo, I didn't notice it all and slept fine.
My brain, hearing something I don't like help me tune it out. Some days though, say I wake up for a bathroom visit, come back to bed and hear those darn boats, it still bothered me enough to prevent me from going back to sleep again - even after several years of living there.
 
My brain helped me tuned the sound out, but what I'm hearing that is there - will still be there. The sounds of cover-less engine on those boats didn't sound more pleasing to me after 8 years of living in that condo. It didn't make me want to get up early in the morning, sat with a cup of coffee by the windows and listen to the sounds of those engine.
 
Brain burn-in... don't think so.

Right just got back from picking up my new Light Harmonic DaVinci Dual DAC from Melbourne. For the 1st time I heard the LCD-3F's through the DaVinci and then into the Woo 234's Mono's - to say I was blown away is an understatement !!
 
I had no idea how good the LCD-3's could sound, my partner and I compared them to the Abyss and we both preferred the LCD-3's there was no struggle. 
 
After a long day flying back with the DAC - 39KG I am now listening to the LCD-3's with some Cardas Clear cable, through my Studio Six. Its a fine amp but I was stunned at how the Woo's transformed the LCD-3's - they sounded totally different and utterly fantastic. The sound was holographic and 3D. It was obvious from the 1st moment the music played.
 
I have to eat my words about the Cardas Clear, I originally said I preferred the Nordost Heimdall 2's but I was wrong, the Cardas is much richer tonally and more musically satisfying.
 
Very expensive trip as within 5 minutes of hearing the Woo's we were asking when we could have a pair. They will be here next week.
 
More reports to follow:

I am sorry mate, I started with a Hugo and well it spiralled out of control form there! I am very lucky my partner got up at 3am yesterday and flew down on an early flight with me. It was the 1st time we had heard the Woo 234's with the LCD-3's that we love so much. She turned round to me within 5 minutes of listening and said well we need these - now, go and organise them. Great stuff !
 
This hobby is addictive, so to be honest when I looked at the endless cycle of upgrading selling used etc etc, it made sense to go straight to the end game. 
 
We were both genuinely shocked at how much better the Woo's were, it was dramatic, there are some upgrades you can postpone but we both realised that what we were hearing could not be compromised on. My partner was so shocked at the difference she took the LCD's off and checked to see if they were the same headphone.
 
I think a couple of things are going on here:
 
The Studio Six is single ended and I think that could hurt its performance.
The SS seems to impose its sonic signature on every piece of equipment thus far, it is not allowing any of the really good DAC's to realise their full sonic potential.
The SS is having the same effect on headphones.
 
The Woo's will be here next week they weigh 30 KG per channel so the airline will have a fit again.

Your guess is as good as mine.  The representative, via Audeze's ZenDesk support portal, told me this (verbatim):
 

 
If you take this representative at their word, there was some notion of a public upgrade offering that flopped, then they summarily decided to cancel the upgrade.  Again--who knows--maybe they wanted there to be lack of interest so they say they offered it, but no one was interested.
 
I don't expect Audeze to take a beating on providing existing customers with new technology.  I will pay an appropriate price, up to a certain point (say $500.00), but don't offer it, then jerk it and cite lack of interest if the word was never properly gotten out, which was a point I made to the representative in my closing remarks of the ticket.
 
I don't mean to be a hard-on about it, but this is clearly one marketing campaign that flopped.

I had one of the old pairs of LCD-2s with the foam head band...well before any of the fazors came in to focus. I enjoyed them for many years without any issues. Driver failure finally caught up to me and occurred well past the warranty and were repaired and returned within a month without issue. I liked the cans so I wanted them around. The newer fazor addition is quite nice, i can understand why many perhaps did not enjoy the earlier version of the LCD-2 but with certain genres of music is did have its magic. 
 
While the LCD-2  was out, I decided to move up to the  LCD-3f latest version. From the hundreds of pages on this forum I found a couple references that the LCD-3fs really up scaled well so I started looking at amps. I threw my name in the hat for a GSX-MkII but not being a long time patient man continued to look for a solution that I could find a bit sooner. 
 
With the Red Wine Audio, love it or hate it, was love for me...the differences in the cans ad me rolling tubes a bit and I ended up with the Amperex Bugle Boy vesus my older Telefunken.
 
But I decided to add my name is on the list for the GSX-MkII and began searching for a balanced DAC. Here and there I read happy words regarding this elusive "Lampi" DAC. Did my research...the company ethos for sound basically was my wish lists....so I am now the proud owner of a Lampizator Head DAC Gen 4 Lvl 4.  I have to say that thing is a bit magical with the LDC lines. Fluid, sweet, detailed, holographic really, resolving.
 
The sound is in the room and then when the music starts it just takes you away...like your own personal concert with you favorite band. The music just floats out there in front of you and you can hear all the details. Everything just sounds right again whether with the 2 or the 3. With the lampi you are going to clearly see the differences between the two cans....is harder to head back to the LCD2 as often now.
 
First thoughts, I have only had the amp for a couple days.

Yeah I have tried tube dampners. Didn't work for me. I found tube rolling does the trick. I have a sweet sound signature now. Never get those cringe harsh treble moments.
I found the rectifiers to make the biggest differences. Many talk about the Mullard GZ32. It is a great mellow tube so I have 5 of those. I tried the Fivre 5R4GY and that improved over the Mullard. Better dynamics and bass. So I own 4 of those.
I have recently took a risk on the Brimar 5Z4G. This is a sell your soul to the devil sound. It has everything. Deep clean bass, massive mid-range and treble is highish without getting harsh. So silky so tube detail is there. Silkiest sounding tube yet. I have two, however I plan to buy 5 more. They can be had for 12.5 pound. Crazy cheap.
The power tubes don't do much. I have some Brimar 6080's that are treble rolled. However too much for me. RCA 6AS7G are okay. I actually find the Russian 6AS7G really nice and ticks all the right boxes. Dynamic, powerful and not harsh. So I use those. I need to grab more. I have some rare Chatham and Tung-Sol 6AS7G's as well. But they are gold so I won't use until I retire. Also have a lot of Raytheon, Sylvania 6AS7G's as well.
Drivers. No contest. RCA 6SN7GT Greyglass. The perfect tube to just roll of the edge and add a touch of mellow. I have two sets of these and will hunt down many more sets of these next year. The clear glass version from the 50's is close to the greyglass. Just creeps in a little treble harshness. I have some Sylvania 6SN7's as well. Avoid. So damn bright.
If you can't get your signature with tame tubes then you may have to look EQ?Edited by Badas - 12/20/14 at 2:29pm

The Head DAC (Gen 4, Lvl 4) is a bit hard to quantify, both relaxed and dynamic based on the recording. I would lean a bit towards the relaxed side perhaps in the mindset that I never find it dry and overly analytical sounding. Selling point for me was the focus on "musicality" while maintaining resolution. The Head DAC really does just sound "correct"...you start the music, you hear the detail, and then your mind relaxes the toes start tapping and time just fades away. Conveys the emotions of the music.
 
This is my first full tube, non-integrated set up so I do not have a good background to quantify the sound against. Still using the stock tubes and have not rolled in other options. Current tubes roll off a little bit of the sub-bass, it is still there but tighter and less boomy. I am amazed at the level of detail that I was missing previously. The Head DAC I have uses 4 ECC88's. 
 
Lampizator has many different levels to choose from and as they are voiced you could likely get various nuances from the different levels...mine just being the entry level. My set up is not perfect and have just started the journey with this DAC but initial impressions for my ears have me very pleased. The upgrade at the entry level was enough to hit the "music all sounds new again" which is a significant upgrade in my opinion. From here will dial in little changes and will see where to go in the future. 
 
There was some discussing on the forum that the LCD-2 was the "sounds good with everything" can and the LCD-3 was a little more picky but was referenced as upscaling well. I has a similar feeling before but the LCD-3f sounds good with everything again. I think the "house sound" of Lampizator has good synergy with these cans. The Head DAC and LCD-3f sounded good to my ears right away...and then continued to improve as my ears started dialing in on the little things that I was missing. Not overly analytical or dry sounding which is something I would not really prefer...hence the tube DAC decision. I also enjoy the possibility to change sound signatures along the way which I understand at times can be frustrating (as well as expensive) at times.

Just a general fact about this:
The position of the volume knob does not determine in ANY way the power of the amp, and if this power is enough or not to drive your headphones.  It is just related to the gain of the amp and above all the RMS voltage of the output of your source.
An amp could deliver too low a power to drive some headphones and still sound "loud" (and distorted) with a very low position of the volume knob.  And the opposite is also true: plenty of power (and very low distorsion) but a high volume knob position required to sound satisfyingly loud.
 
Now, I can't tell anything about the OPPO.  We will wait for someone who knows about this specific amp :)
 
Edit: I've just read a bit about the specs of the OPPO, it seems like a powerful enough amp to drive the Audeze with utter clarity.  But we will still wait for someone who has tried it ! :)

To give the other side of the equation, I also have heard the Burson Conductor, and I own it! 
 
The Burson Conductor is a great piece of equipment and pairs really well with the LCD-3's. Once upgraded with the CM6631 USB Module I've had rock-solid performance of the Conductor (the prior Tenor USB implementation was not as good) and the sound of the unit is great. In terms of SQ I'd give the win to the Conductor over the Opppo HA-1. However, the HA-1 also has a lot of additional features than the Conductor, although as a desktop DAC/amp combo the Conductor has everything I need - the bells and whistles had not practical application for me. 
 
Another point to note is that the prices on the Conductor have come down a bit since the Virtuoso has been released, even though as far as I can tell there have not been many changes to that affect SQ (primarily a change to a 100-step volume control as well as the addition of a remote control and a volume level display - the last two of which would seem to apply more to the use of a Conductor as a pre-amp versus a desktop HP amp). Given approximate parity in price across the original Conductor and the HA-1 I'd default to the Burson, but that's only my opinion. 
 
Cheers and good luck!

If you are willing to go to $2k then you absolutely must audition the BMC PureDAC. It is the best all-in-one I have ever heard. I compared it side by side with a Burson Conductor and there was no comparison. The BMC is esssentially a dac with an output stage that can drive headphones directly, there is no separate resistive pot and gain stage. It all happens in one step. It also has a great line level output stage so can double and a digital dac/pre for a conventional stereo (with separate power amp) as well. It is a great dac that works with double rate DSD and up to 384 kHZ PCM. The BMC is just stupid-good for the money at $1700 and works great with the LCD-3s through it's balanced headphone output stage. I had one for several months, and the only reason I sold it was to fund a tube amp. I still kind of regret selling it.

I have a dedicated amplifier Schiit Lyr atm, I was looking for a headphone and speaker amp in one, oppo ha-1 is a headphone amp together with a dac, I don't need the DAC part at all...
 

 
The Precision 2 one looks to be an alternative certainly, though the chassis is really ugly and the inside doesn't look so well put enough I've looked into the review by headmania, not too bad, but if there's a better alternative that would be better :P
 
Also I didn't like the fact that the review from headmania claims that the headphone out is not very neutral, it's on the warm side which doesn't sound like fun, I have a tube amp already and I am not a tube roller guy because tubes don't have infinite lifetime though they do change the sound signature significantly... But on the other hand I also don't really like the amps that are a bit on the sharp side (sharp treble) like the Bryston BHA-1 which besides the treble issue also has a problem with 0 volume (0 volume? yeah right) but if I were to get a dedicated headphone amp I'd probably get Auralic Taurus mk2 for sure, the problem is that I want both a speaker and a headphone amp in one, on the high end (in terms of pricing around the price of the Ragnarok, 2000 tops)

Just got my LCD-3s and confirmed they are the Fazor revision.  Everything was sealed and looks great but I'm not seeing that
wood cleaner bottle, wipes or the frequency response printout.  (I thought these items were supposed to be included)  Should
I have received these items or does Audeze no longer include them?  I've reached out to both the reseller and Audeze just to
confirm but I was curious if anyone else has experienced this.  Thanks.
 
EDIT: BTW, the box that the travel case came in was sealed with the Audeze gold sticker. (I had to slice it to open the box)
Also, the case itself was very well sealed with plastic that I had to cut to remove the case so it would seem to me that this was
a factory seal that wasn't tampered with by the reseller.  Maybe Audeze left it out?

LCD-3F's and DR rating
 
These are the first cans that made very obvious to me the difference between low dynamic range and high dynamic range masters. For some reason I find it hard to listen to albums with a DR rating 7 and lower, and I will better enjoy ones with a DR rating of 9 and above. Also, in most cases I can immediately guess the approximate DR of a track I'm listening to. The thing is, with my previous cans, and with others I'm currently using, those differences were much less obvious and I had less of a problem listening to those modern loudness-wars-infected albums. Nowadays I will be quite picky about which press of an album to buy/listen to.
 
Can anyone explain why that is? Do you think it's a shortcoming of this headphone or is it a result of its strengths? Is what I'm hearing "the truth" or just an artifact?
I'm very interested in your opinions!

Sorry if this isn't the best thread to ask this question.  I looked through the LCD-3 / HD-800 amp thread and this thread and only found one mention on this thread which surprised me a little. I currently have the HD-800 running thought the HDVD-800 amp which I really enjoy.  Just picked up the LCD-3 and waiting for it to arrive. Anyone have any input as to how the LCD-3 will sound with the HDVD-800?  I was kind of hoping that the amp might provide acceptable performance for both  but thought I'd ask in the meantime.  In some respects I'd rather try to ultimately  end up with one amp that would work well with both even if that means selling the HDVD-800.  The HDVD-800 was more expensive than most of the amps I see mentioned as being a good fit for the LCD-3, not that cost always means as much as one would might think.

I think when I get the tubes upgrades for my WA5 it will be sufficient power for the LCD3f - the WA5 is surely a good enough amp to let me hear what these cans are capable of - even with stock tubes. 
 
I will also have a nice solid state amp soon and I will give them a good run on that as well. 
 
You have heard these on both types of amp Peter? WA22 and GSX? - Do you think a solid state amp will improve the separation?
I don't mind the smaller soundstage, its the closeness of the instruments that bother me the most, like trying to squash too many words on the one line (if that makes sense)
 

The are very good with Rock - I agree. Also with badly recorded punk and metal. Metalica's "Black" album was almost un-listenable with HD800 and really nice with the LCD3f. 
 
The LCD3f has managed to tame all the vocal and trumpet harshness on tracks that I had problems with T1 + HD800. e.g - Billie Holliday - day in day out and Wynton Marsalis - the legend of buddy bolden. 
 
However this awesome bass that everyone talks about is something that I have not experienced yet. It sounds bloated, boomy and flabby to my ears at the moment at least. 
 
If the separation and bass improves with a few tweaks I will be a happy camper - fingers crossed

Well at that time the GS-X mk2 was the best amp I had.  It beat out amps like:  4 channel B22, Bryston BHA-1, EF-6, Burson 160D and a few others.  Then I went to an audio shop here in Cincinnati with my HE-6 in hand.  I tried it on a number of high end speaker amps and yes - they sound better than I had ever heard.  However, I could not afford any of those high end amps.
 
Then a head-fi buddy (SoupRKnowa) said I had to hear this amp with the HE-6 - at the time it was the First Watt F1.  Needless to say I bought it from him.  Sent it to Nelson Pass so he could upgrade it to the First Watt F1J.  By the time it got back I cut down my headphones to 1 - the HE-6.  So it became a head to head battle between the F1J and the GS-X mk2 with the HE-6s
 
Well, that's when I sold the GS-X mk2.  Because the F1J was that much better than the GS-X mk (with the HE-6).  The GS-X mk2 is a really good amp,I wouldn't mind owning one again.

The Audeze LCD-3 are the flagship of the Audeze range. These are the top of the line Planar Magnetic headphones from the American company and are built accordingly. The quality of materials used is really amazing, from the time I opened the heavy duty “portable” carrying case to the actual materials used in the unit itself.
The earcups are made from Zebrano wood and the earpads are lambskin – these are incredibly soft and comfortable, however I found that after around 30 mins or so my ears do heat up and it does lead to discomfort.
The LCD3’s weigh in at over half a kilo, I must admit that these are comfortable at first, but after extended listening, the actual unit does tend to be a bit obtrusive. The sound however, is not fatiguing at all. I could listen to these headphones all day – if the unit was actually comfortable.
The LCD3s use an open backed design which means these are not suitable at all for public use or anything outdoors. The unit itself comes with the 6.5mm connection standard, so unless you have an AK or other high end DAP, you wouldn’t be using this on your travels anyway. I chose to use the stock XLR Balanced cable that came with the unit to plug into the Oppo HA-1 Amplifier. According to OPPO, this provides 4x the power and 2x the voltage when used. I was running this in high gain the entire time and the volume knob was at around 12 oclock to 3 oclock (absolute maximum).
Now on to the sound signature. Simply put, when paired with the right equipment and source material (this is very important), the LCD3’s sound signature blew me away. The sound is warm and thick. The highs are crystal clear, the bass is hard hitting and powerful and the mids are strong and delicious. I heard sounds in recordings I never heard before and as soon as I put these on and the music started to play, I began smiling. So it passes test number 1, the smile test.
Listening to a high definition stereo recording of “Come Together” from the Beatles Abbey Road album, the response of the drums and the ability to separate the various instruments was incredible. It must have sounded like this in the actual Abbey Road studio when they were recording this.
I decided to really put the LCD3’s through its paces with some really HD WAV and DSD recordings. The acoustic guitar strings of “The Eagles: Hotel California” were particularly memorable, as was the sheer impact of the bass and drums in “Donald Fagen’s Morph The Cat”. It seemed that everything I through at the LCD-3’s was just hit out of the park. The sound staging and imaging is really worth noticing, particularly when you hear the directionality of where the instruments are coming from. If you closed your eyes and turned off all outside distractions, you really could be at a concert listening to the music. Not only were the sounds clear and able to be distinguished easily, the entire sound stage was just so enjoyable.
Even with standard FLAC recordings, the LCD3’s didn’t falter. The Blue Nile’s Album “Peace at Last” is my favourite to audition any form of audio equipment. From the beautiful vocals, to the acoustic guitars to the clear, dulcet tones of the piano – it is an absolute aural delight. The LCD’3 resolved this absolutely perfectly and even when the strings came in, I could clearly identify directionality, staging and the separation of instruments.
I thought it was time for something a bit more energetic and powerful. Fleetwood Mac “Go Your Own Way” and ACDC “Thunderstruck” were both amazing on the LCD-3s. The unit was so versatile in resolving completely different sounds and instrumentation.

The unit is not without its flaws however. As mentioned, it can be uncomfortable and heat up pretty quickly. Also, if you have low quality or badly recorded source material, then you will definitely notice them with these Audeze: these headphones do not suffer fools lightly.
And then there is the price. At $2,000 it is going to be a stumbling block for a lot of people. The question is, is it worth the price, considering you are also going to have to have the appropriate gear to even run these headphones as these are not the most efficient. I guess that is something you will have to ask yourself. For me, it is a resounding yes. For $2K I get to use arguably the best headphones available on the planet – (I haven’t had a chance to hear the Stax SR009 and Abyss 1266 as yet).
These are recommended for all, but with the caveats above. If you are after something portable or for use in public, better to opt for the soon-to-be-released close backed EL-8s. However, for those of us who want to relax at home and shut off from the rest of the world, the Audeze LCD-3s are the perfect companion.

Everything was improved with the tubes - I have no problem with this headphone anymore - its sounds beautiful out of the WA5 with EML300b. Pop - Funk and soul music sound amazing....... which is what I wanted,. sometimes the HD800 can be a tad too harsh on old soul records e.g - "Lady Soul" ...... the LCD3 clear it all up. Very impressed and I take back everything I said before about congested sound stage. I really just didn't have it amped properly. 
 
Great for rock as well and I agree with what Rumay said  - it is better than HD800 for most rock. Some really well recorded albums like Porcupine tree sound better on HD800 but for classics like Zeppelin and Deep Purple I prefer LCD3. 
 
I will try some Louis Prima now a report back ..... HD800 is better for most jazz IMO but some stuff like - Billie Holiday and Louis might be better on LCD3, I will find out soon.

I've been going back and forth between wanting to buy the LCD-X and the LCD-3 and just can't make up my mind. So thought I would post and ask here.
 
The music I listen to is EDM, hard rock, pop and some movie soundtracks.
 
I also need to use these for doing some audio mixing. This is the part where I am torn about which would be the best for me. I've had a number of people say that the LCD-X would be the better choice for mixing. But now that the 3 has the fazor technology, might it be a good choice for what I'm trying to do as well?
 
Currently, I have the Asgard 2 amp with the Uber Bifrost DAC. I'm hoping it will drive it for now. Shortly, I will pick something else up. Considering the Ragnarok and others.
 
By the way, is there a way to contact Audeze by phone? Another concern I have is that I am outside of the United States. I cannot afford to have a headphone sent to me that has not gone through very strict quality control checks. The cost of having it brought in and then having to send it back out and bring it back in again for repairs would be inordinately expensive.
 
Any thoughts or help would be much appreciated.

Haven't heard the Mad Dog's my only reference point prior to these was a DT880 (prior to upgrading I auditioned HE-560, HE-500, PM-1, LCD-X, LCD-3F, T1, HD800). 
 
I agree with others here that the choice comes down to personal preference; and therefore the only sound way to choose is to audition both.
 
I'm a head-fi noob so don't expect any detailed frequency-tailored remarks from me on this front, I just connected to/enjoyed music more on the 3 (test tracks used for reference; Diana Krall Live in Paris - Love being here with you, SRV - Tin Pan Alley, Septic Flesh - Vampire from Nazareth, Dusty Springfield - Son of a Preacher Man, T. Chapman- Fast Car, AC/DC - Thunderstruck, Porcupine Tree - Trains, Dire Straits - Telegraph Road (Live), Leprous - Bilateral, Opeth - Goblin, Yo-Yo Ma - The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Miles Davis- Freddie Freeloader, Kayo Dot - Mortality of Doves, Massive Attack - Angel). 
 
Some further remarks:
- I had the impression LCD3's benefit more from a powerful amp. Although I already preferred the 3F to X on a WA7, after hearing the 3's on other amps (Transrotor, Ragnarok, Leben CS300X) it is clear that in comparison, they sound closed in and laid back on the WA7. Make sure you pair the 3's with a "properly matched" amp when auditioning (if you are willing to fork out for amping that is). 
- I found the padding on the 3 to be a bit softer / more comfortable.
- The 3F's are the heaviest 637 g compared to 611 g for the X. I didn't expect this at first but all weight ratings for 3's you find on the net are pre-fazor and hence lower @ 550g. I don't mind the weight BTW, can wear mine for hours... .

Hi guys, just wanted to share some night computer writing...posted this on the WA7 forum but since it heavily involves my dearest LCD-3 I thought I'll also post it here :)
 
I think one has to post some impressions, so here goes, with a bit of background first. Sorry for the length, but I feel that in order to describe what I feel with the LCD3 on the WA7, I must highlight where I come from, sonically speaking...
 
I am pretty new to this hobby. I discovered the head-fi world in 2012 with the Shure SRH440 at the time, then SRH1840, then I decided to make the real jump and got the LCD-3 (original non-Fazored).
In parallel I slowly moved the ladder of sound card / amp / DAC, and got for some reason on the way interested in the electrostatic sound. All of which that leads me today to be the happy owner of one Conductor, one Soloist, one Stax SRM-323s amp and the corresponding LCD-3, LCD-XC, and SR-507 cans.
 
All of these are amazing products that generate exquisite music, with my special personal preference going for the LCD-3. But I was also mesmerized by the ghostly, aerial presentation of the Stax. Dreaming of a phone that could have some, if not all, of the qualities of an electrostat and a planar in one package, I was pretty excited to read about such a combination of sound being mentioned in reviews for the HE-560. A week later, while shopping for something totally unrelated in an audio store, I stumbled upon said HE-560, and impulse-bought it. My flawless logic then led me to be deeply convinced that, since I was again burning money on head-fi, I might as well finish the job properly and finally welcome tubes in my sound life.
 
A week of head-fi reading later, I had my sights locked on the WA7d + tp duo, mainly because of its looks. No: almost exclusively because of it looks. Sure, it had pretty good reviews, but I honestly didn't really read them. I mean: it was from Woo Audio, and it was, if not expensive in hi-fi terms, at least un-cheap. These two guarantees were the only backing I needed to cave in, given the overwhelming power of the fact that these are maybe the cutest pieces of Hi-Fi I have ever seen. Correlated bonus: extremely high WAF.
 
In the process of reading about the WA7 on head-fi, I learned about the concept of tube rolling, decided it was the bomb, and in utter - and a bit stupid - blindness ordered Gold Plated tubes for the amp, and those RAF Mullards for the power supply, which seemed to be - at least for several days - the endgame for the tp.
 
But I had to wait for the Woo for at least a week to begin my tube voyage, so I had a bit of time to play with my impulsively acquired HE-560. I still had after all some good old solid-state sound amping at my disposal. And after trying them out, I was really pleased with their sound when fed by my Conductor. They perform brilliantly, and, to my infinite satisfaction, exactly as expected. This combination is not the point of this write-up (what is?...) but the HE-560 with the Burson offers what I can describe as electrostatic-like precision and speed, coupled with the tactility of a planar. Since the phones were fed by three amps from the same source, I kept switching live between SR-507, LCD-3 and HE-560, and after some semi-serious listening, decided to sonically position Chinese as an almost perfect trade-off between Japanese and American. 
 
So... all this long introduction to basically say that I had already dreamt about, and a probably a bit conceptualized, the sound of the HE-560 on an upgraded WA7d/tp setup. I was for me some kind of tube-lushy electroplanar heaven.
 
Then the Woo pair finally arrived at my place, got eagerly setup by my trembling hands, and saw the replacement tubes plugged in immediately, without the stock ones being given more than a glance. At last my dream setup was ready to bestow to my ears the truth.
 
One little hour proved enough to make it painfully obvious: the WA7d/tp + HE-560 combo was...OK.
 
Pains me to say it, but to my ears, it was OK. Of course, here, OK means already pretty incredible relative to anything other than at least "summit mid-fi". But still, given the reviews of the WA7, of the HE-560, given the raving about these British Royal Air Force tubes, given, given... It was just OK. I was under the utterly horrible and as utterly immediate impression of disappointment. It didn't live to my expectations, and I knew - knew - that no, in time, it never will. I don't believe in burn-in anyway.
 
It was just a less than optimal pairing. Instead of an expected just right amount of vitality added to the spectral electrostatic-like sound in the upper medium and treble regions of the HE-560, alongside - of course - a killer bass giving both impact and depth, and all coming together magically to bring me to audio heaven, I obtained what I can describe as a fast but dry, analytical and even at times aggressive sound. The HE-560 kicks and beats and transients and sparkles in all the right spots, but it all seems a bit too digitalized. The sound was still enjoyable, just not at the level I had imaged it would reside. Maybe it was the tube combination, but it just didn't feel right to my ears.
 
My glorious but useless plan having been, in the course of one listening hour, thrown out of the window, I had to improvise. Preferably fast: buyer's remorse could strike me at any moment. Luckily, the thought process didn't take long: I got up and went for my LCD-3.
 
Utterly ignorant of what to expect, I plugged the Audeze in the Woo, fired up the Very Best of Supertramp in FLAC, and listened.
 
Three hours from this moment I can now safely say that I wasn't prepared for this.
 
I must have heard the Supertramp compilation at least 40 times, and tend to think I know the songs by heart. This, given the relative musical richness of Supertramp, makes for a good comparison point.
 
But in all honesty I don't think there is much comparison. As much as I love the rest of my gear, I seriously am at a loss of words to describe the increase in overall realism offered by the Woo setup to the LCD-3. As I said I didn't try the stock tubes (both for the amp and the power supply) but I will certainly at some point, in order to determine the impact of the EH / Mullard tubes, i.e. how much do they bring compared to the "basic" WA7d + WA7tp setup. However, in their upgraded state, the Woo boxes send to the LCD what I can only describe as a fuller, more coherent, more natural version of basically every song of Supertramp I ever heard, and probably every other musical piece that I know of.
 
Incidentally, detail retrieval its stepped up a notch, which in all honesty I find strange, given what I thought I knew about tube amps in general and the DAC part of the WA7 in particular. I do get more detail when using my LCD-3 with this setup than with the Conductor as DAC / amp. It's a run-down cliché but in these really, really familiar songs of Supertramp, I heard details I never knew were there. However, as much as this comment is to be expected when moving from say a Macbook jack port to a any successful $300 DAC / amp, I was truly astonished to realize it with a highly regarded $2000 setup as reference.
 
I said the sound was more natural, this is also a cliché but again - cannot find another word. Everything is just more defined, precise, has its place, its natural space. Soundstage is not only wide but seems also "realistically populated". Voice sing, I mean sing, there do not seem like signals trying, even if with great skill, to pass as voices. The general consistency of the sound was a shock to me. The crazily accurate mids, the intricately detailed highs, and the simply unreal bass...everything has just gone up a notch in terms of realism. A big, big notch. The sound coming from the LCD-3 was for the first time not the result of some really, really good digital-then-analogue reproduction of music, but just music. This step is for me enormous.
 
I seriously don't know what happens with this particular setup. For the sake of it, I tried the LCD-XC on the WA7 and it wasn't really the same. It was still excellent, but not quite the same. Unfortunately, don't have the X or the 3F to try them out too...
 
All in all, this long story closes to an end, with what I see as an unexplainable yet dramatically obvious conclusion: there is magic going on with a WA7tp with some Mullard tubes in it connected to a WA7d with some EH Gold tubes in it connected to a LCD-3 classic. I seriously cannot stress that point enough.
 
And I would be more than delighted to hear others' impressions with this setup, because I think it might be losing it a bit here...

Well the impressions are more with the X's than the 3f's but I'm going back and forth between the 2 and I don't hear a big dif., at least not as much as 3c vs.X. Not the biggest comparison but out of the WA6 SE, Liquid Fire and Peak/Volcano I def. preferred the Peak/Volcano. I also tried 2 different dac's the tranquility SE and Auralic ark mx+ and the results were the same.
 
To me the peak/volcano just sounded more synergetic, slightly bright, and despite it being only one tube had way more tube qualities 3d, natural tone, micro detail than the other 2 competitors. The Liquid Fire and WA6 SE were bought used unlike the peak/volcano but I didn't see anything wrong with the amps and both amps came with expensive set(s) of aftermarket tubes. The tube change did not help though and really didn't do much to change the sound. I got the peak/volcano with both the stock tungsol and a free princess from todd and thought the amp was good but not great. Switched to a 6 pack of vintage that I got from Brent and wow. The Peak/Volcano despite being 1 vs. a set in the other 2 amps really changes in sound way more dramatically. I then pulled the trigger on a b65 since the euro and gbp tanked and yowza it was really great sounding. I would say the 5692 is my fav. bang for the buck and b65 my fav.
 
I also tried my X's on someone else's dna stratus/ metrum hex and we both agreed that his hd800's were the way better match. Could have been the hex, could have been the X's instead of the 3f but I think the stratus is too warm for audeze's. Don't get me wrong, the X sounded good but as far as tube amps go I think for less money and less tubes to worry about you will get similar if not better results out of the Peak/Volcano.
 
I was curious about the Zana but enjoy Mike at Headfonia and he picked the Peak/Volcano over it with 2's and I like his reviews. I haven't read that article in a while but I think he had the Zana for like a couple of years so I don't think he came to that decision lightly. One of these days I will get around to trying it. I would also like to try out a Taboo at some point.

Good summary.
 
I would add that the LCD-3f has a sub-bass that the Rev 2 or LCD-2f does not reproduce. The LCD-2f might provide a tad more visceral experience in the lows (at a loss of an amount of separation and detail)....old Rev 2 has less detail but more slam. You will really notice the extra detail that is captured with the LCD-3f if you switch back to the LCD-2 after some time away. I started with the Rev 2 and then the 2f...the LCD-3f gets the system time these days. That sub bass and detail in the end proved more addictive. 
 
For the LCD-Rev 2...I really loved the Rev 2. I had this one as the everything headphone for around 5 years. The can as you mentioned was a darker and more aggressive LCD. They received some bad press on the forum due to some initial driver failures but were a really amazing headphone with the right type of music (electronic, rock, metal, and in reality many other genres). The soundstage was not as large, presentation was more "I am in the room with the band" but the synergy with aggressive music, man, better than any headphone I have owned.  I had a driver fail on me after 5 years of heavy usage...had them upgraded with new 2f drivers. While waiting on the upgrade/fix I added in the LCD-3f. The LCD-3f gets the play time in my system but there are still many days that I miss the old Rev 2 when I just want to rock out a bit...at the 3f level there is enough detail that you lose a bit of the "wall of sound" effect used in some heavier music. 
 
If you can, I would keep the Rev2 and add an LCD-3f. The LCD-3f sound signature is a significant enough of a change that it would provide a contrast in listening sessions.  The change between the 2f and the 3f is more micro detail and sub-bass but the overall signature is more similar. LCD-3f would likely win you over in the end...you miss the details once you hear them.  
 
This of course depends on the music you like and then the rest of your chain...amps, source, etc.  The LCD-3f benefit is more apparent the farther you move up the chain.
 
I upgraded amps once I went with the 3f...full tube amp which has been a fun experience.
 
What sounds right to you is what is right for you. You could always listen to some Senns if you decide to stop enjoying music. (just kidding)

I don't have any other headphone amp, I'm using it for now with HD700 and I hear some distortion, not much in the tube "warmth"... either I'm too used to the LCD-3, or something is wrong with my chain, I remember it was much better than this from my STX card back when I still had it in my PC.
 
another 2-3 weeks until I get my Master 9 then I can say goodbye to Lyr ;)
 
Regarding the driver under warranty, as I've talked to them on the phone (to tony) I did take the liberty to ask him about if I would be getting an upgrade like others have (As I've heard) and he said of course... then I've also messaged Chikolad (from this forum) and he said that he has heard from someone who did get a failed driver but didn't get a new one.
 
they did say they have to change the drivers, even if only the left driver broke they would of course have to match the drivers so they will change the second one too...

I have a pair of the pre-fazor LCD-3's (not the "veiled ones tho...the 261 serial number series). I did have a chance to hear the fazored LCD-3's at a local dealer, but I didn't have mine with me at the time to compare them to. I've read everything on this thread (and the "New LCD-3 thread on here), and I'm torn as to whether or not I should upgrade. I mean, I do love what mine sound like with my WA7+WA7tp combo, but I think I'm suffering from the "grass is greener" thingy where I'm wondering if I would like the fazored LCD-3 just a tad more.
 
I could sell my LCD-3C and upgrade to the LCD-3F, but I'm struggling with whether or not it's really worth it. For sure, I'll take a hit, $-wise, but then again we're not in this hobby because we're necessarily concerned with that.
 
I'd be interested in hearing anyone else's thoughts that are in the same situation as I am. The other thing that I have in the back of my mind is to just hold on to the 3C's, and consider buying the HifiMan HE-1000's if they live up to the hype. So far, my current 3C's are the only can I own.
 
Thoughts?

Hey guys, new LCD-3F owner! Just upgraded from HD-650's. All I can say is this... finally some planar's that can satisfy me the way the 650's can. My ears aren't bleeding from brightness, and the speedy presentation is welcome... I don't miss the decay I've fallen in love with from the 650's as much as I thought I would. Also, my nicely recorded songs now sound even better, and the ones that aren't recorded/mastered so well now sound terrible. Yipes.
 
So far, using the WA2 which made the 650's sound better than anything else I used. I love the LCD-3F's on this setup, but I'm open to hearing what you guys would consider a better tube setup for the LCD-3F's... I owned the WA7 in the past and found it overly dry/analytical to my ears. Maybe the WA2 is powerful enough to bring out the full response from the LCD-3's? Maybe not? I'm open to hear what ya'll think.
 
Thanks :)

@spidipidi - I feel your pain. I couldn't even make a post here on Sunday from being so livid.  After barely 2 months, my brand new LCD-3Fs had a left driver failure (out of the blue).  I had really fallen in love with these new cans, and my beloved HD800s were starting to get a little dust on them.  From a "black and white" perspective, I hate the fact that I've paid $2K for premium cans only to experience a dead driver within the first 60 days (of moderate use).  
 
However, thinking "glass half full" I must admit that Audeze's customer service hasn't let me down as of yet.  I got my RMA clearance within a few hours and the cans are due to arrive with them today.  Now, I have two weeks to bump uglies with the Senns again :)
 
I'm just hoping this isn't something I'll constantly have to worry about each time I sit down for a session.

Hey guys, anyone a fan of the Sennheiser HD-650's? I'd really like to have a chat with someone who went from them to the LCD-3's... I am so far convinced that the only thing I prefer listening to on the LCD-3 Fazor's is jazz...
 
I've been rolling different tube combos in the Woo WA2 with the LCD-3's, and I'm shocked to find that it seems to me the HD-650's are imaging better with Siemens CCa tubes. I really can't hear any combo I prefer with the LCD-3's except Telefunken tubes and jazz. The LCD-3's are MUCH faster headphones, and have exceptional pace/rhythm/timing/attack, but I'm just really not feeling the same experience as when I plug the HD-650's back in. I know the highs are further reaching on the LCD-3's, but I'm hearing more micro-detail on the 650's, and it's killing me. Do the LCD's just not like OTL amps? Help me out here...

How does the Lyr work for them? I have a large collection of 6DJ8 tubes that I enjoy using with the Woo WA2, but I'm just not feeling the love with the LCD's. I have found brightening things up with tubes helped with the HD-650's, but the LCD's are just sounding dull all around. Nothing pops out at all, and I'm used to listening to laid-back headphones (they're my preference to begin with... I really hate the newer bright headphones, that's why I upgraded from the 650's to the LCD-3F's). Like I said, I tried Siemens grey CCa's, Telefunken E188CC and CCa's, Philips pinched waist 6922's, etc... these tubes really shine with the 650's, but I find them all to sound rather lackluster with the WA2 and LCD's. The Telefunken's did sound superb, but very neutral. Jazz is great, but rock/acoustic not so much. (The funny thing is the LCD's actually sound rather good with a Telefunken tube straight out of the T1 as well...)

Audeze does indeed say it needs 1W @ 32 ohms , but the reality is different IMHO (especially as the newer headphones have different sensitivity as well as impedance). There are plenty of amplifiers that drive it well enough. Look at this chart here
 
http://linustechtips.com/main/topic/221772-calculating-audeze-lcd-2s-power-requirement-vs-o2/
 
It talks about LCD-2 but the basic principles are the same, as just as the LCD-2 has had a couple of iterations of sensitivity changes, so has the LCD-3 had a significant change.
 
You will notice with the original LCD 2 that approx. 700mw is required to hit 120dB of dynamic range. 120dB of dynamic  range is a bit of a dangerous listening level if there are regular peaks at that point. It could cause hearing damage!
 
However, you do want to be within the optimum operational range of an amplifier so having some headroom is a good idea. Having said that I found the LCD-3c worked just fine on the Sony PHA-3 amplifier in balanced mode which is 320mW per channel.

Well when mine turned up a few weeks back I was pleased with the sound but not elated - in honesty I was initially concerned I had "wasted" a truck load of money.
 
There was something about them that kept drawing me back though.  Several weeks on and I can't put them down.  I have since even sold my Alpha Primes which I dearly loved.
 
The more time I spent with new kit (particularly the more expensive stuff) I'm coming to the conclusion that my experience are perhaps better described as "brain burn-in" i.e getting really used to, and appreciating, the sound.  It takes time.
 
That all said, I have not got rid of my HD800 and imagine I won't because they are still more "airy" (to use your word) than the LCD so for classical music I do sometimes switch back.  The LCDs still get at least 90% head time though - LOVE them.

Hey guys, just a quick update for anyone who is interested... I was driving my LCD-3f's with the Woo WA2 (with Tung Sol 5998 power tubes and various 6922/CCa driver tubes) and found the sound to be dull, with a compressed soundstage. Overall, I was sad.
 
Today I decided to pull out an old class-d Panasonic amp (The SA-XR50) and try it out with the LCD-3's... at first it sounded just ok and about the same as the Woo. I let it warm up for about an hour, and then tried again. I am blown away. These headphones sound effing unreal with this amp... simply phenominal. The soundstage is much, much wider and deeper... and the overall sound is much more vivid and involving (bass, mids and highs). I am seriously blown away.
 
I've read in the past that these class-d's excel at driving speakers, but I have to say that using the headphone out to drive the LCD's sounds superb. I've also read that perhaps the class-d magic is only on the speaker output, but I don't think that is true. I'll have to open it up sometime and take a look at the headphone circuit. 
 
If anyone has one of these old Pannys, please pull it out and give it a shot. I will also offer up a comparison to the Cavalli LC when it arrives in August.

To my understanding and when i had the 2.2's the LCD 2.2 pads were a lot harder than the LCD 3s and held their shape for longer but were not as comfy and gave me hot pressure spots.
 
When i got the LCD3's i noticed straight away how much softer the pads were (this is why some people bought LCD 3 pads for their LCD 2's) and how much smoother the leather was.

Audeze used to have an option for LCD 2 or 3 pads but now the site only seems to have the 3's (good move in my opinion) I myself am tossing up whether to get the microfiber pads as i find my right ear touches the fazor after a few hours of listening but am scared i might loose some of that silky smooth bass that i love.
 
tldr; Yes the pads on the website are compatible with LCD 2 and LCD 3's

I got my (used) LCD-3F only three days ago and only two months after I bought the LCD-2F. The LCD-3 is incredibly good in my opinion. So good that I slept for less than 6 hours every night since then! :-)
 
I am impressed by the quality difference between these cans. Some people describe them sounding very similar and the LCD-3 about 15 % oder 20 % better than the LCD-2 (however they can measure this...). To me the quality difference is much greater. My LCD-3 has deeper, higher impact and more dynamic bass, much warmer and more revealing mids and smoother, less grainy treble. It is darker than the LCD-2, but nevertheless offers a wider and deeper stage. It really shines with the Auralic Taurus MKII and it is my first headphone that sound best to me completely un-equalized. I am very happy. Finally my odyssey comes to an and with this Audezè.

So, auditioning the open back EL-8 tonight.
 
My review so far... extremely easy to drive, sounds good, but doesn't seem to knock anything out of the park.
 
LCD-3F >>>>>>> EL-8 open.
 
Bass, soundstage, treble; all much, much better on the LCD-3F. The mids are about the same to my ears.
 
The EL-8's do sound fairly linear from top to bottom... nothing overly exaggerated. The bass and treble response seems fairly normal in that it doesn't seem to reach very deep, or very high. The LCD-3's are much more fun/exciting/etc. - definitely a more deeper response, and more extension.
 
The presentation is in line with the Audeze house sound, which to me is kind of like sitting in front of two nice speakers... the soundstage seems to come from the same place and envelopes the same way. I also find the EL-8's extremely comfortable, however I also find the LCD-3F's to be comfortable as well.
 
Hope this is on topic, since it's comparing the two. Overall, they're both overpriced imo... I do like my LCD-3F's, but they come at a pretty penny. If someone was auditioning the EL-8's and enjoyed their presentation, but wanted more pizzazz, the LCD-3's would definitely fit the bill.

I purchased the LCD-X and have been listening for 2 weeks. A lot I love but some things were bothering me: the bass impact is great but could use more articulation sometimes, to my ears. The mids feel a bit weak and the highs feel a bit harsh. Well, I was able to compare the X and 3F today, here's what I found at least in terms of the sample I heard.
 
I DID prefer the bass articulation and warmer/softer highs compared to the X. I preferred the timbre in general.  But… the soundstage width seemed to greatly disappear. Much bigger stage and air between the instruments was felt with the X. The LCD-X, to my ears at least, feels much more like a live experience, and I love that.
 
If anything to my ears the X is too bright and the 3F is too warm. But for the feeling of hearing ‘live’, the LCD-X wins out for me. Though I’m sure for long listening the 3F would make more sense. 

 
What I do need to solve though is the shrillness of the highs, at least in terms of how my ears perceive. So thus my question today- how to best tame the highs in the LCD-X:
 
- Will extensive burn-in help? 
 
- Could it perhaps be that a tube amp rather then the Deckard I'm using would be a better choice for the LCD-X in terms of warm, softer highs? 
 
- Should I purchase an equalizer to use post Deckard so I can bring down the highs and bring up the mids?
 
- I do have the MITcables Vero system on order, and if the few reviews out so far are accurate these cables should help. Time will tell.
 
And that’s where it stands. Unless it was a poor sample of the 3F, for now I’m in a holding pattern with the X in the lead.

Now Im with AKG K545, I think the problem comes from the HPs themselves, before time I had K317 and Im familiar with the AKG sound. The highs are too heavy and they even hurted my ears, now Im healing and in order to that I want to choose something that will sathisfy me in the whole spectrum without need to level up (The EQ of DX90 is not good at all). Because of that I want open back even (I dont know how it be if Im outside but the open back I thing will be softer sounding to the ears). Then I think the LCD3 will be well driven only by desktop DAC/AMPS not even Astell & Kern K240.
 
Are EL-8 something to be paired with DX90? And are EL-8 near to the awesomness of the LCD3 (with DX90)? Some people say EL-8 is mids heavy and I dont like it if its so.

My problem is the overall soundstage presentation being for me completely different than the HD-800. This leads to the experience sounding congested, more like an overall wave of music instead of individual performers, and just generally enveloping.
I also have a huge issue with trying to hear micro-details on the 3F's. I hear precise, nuanced details on both the 650's and 800's, where I hear a halo of added bass and treble on the 3F's. I like a warm presentation myself, and find the HD-800's stock treble to be at times intolerable, so it isn't a matter of anything being rolled off on the LCD's. What it is simply just not presenting the details with the same level of clarity. I can quite early pick out two guitar strings producing two individual tones, with different nuanced "vibrations" (for lack of a better term) on the HD's, where on the LCD's, I hear the leading edge of the guitar strings with nice clarity, but then just the resulting tones mushed together. I find it incredibly difficult to enjoy music on the LCD's where resolved details are exciting to hear. Instead, I find them much preferred for the enveloping experience being in the mix provides.
I don't think I'm the only person who feels this way... There is a review by Asr which probably expresses it much better. I feel that this may be why classical listeners may generally prefer other phones...

Not many headphones are going to get anywhere near the HD800 for soundstage. It is the soundstage king. The LCD-3 was never going to compete with that. Totally different headphone aimed at a different market.
 
It sounds to me like you are a detail person and that is great however LCD-3 will never satisfy you. I think there is two types of listeners. Detail and lush. I for instance go for lush. I have a warm DAC. Tube amp with lush warm tubes and the LCD-3. Detail followers will hate it. See not everyone looks for detail. I know I will be losing detail and it doesn't worry me one bit. I like the treble to be there and importantly be rendered sweetly. A nice mid-range push and clean bass. Something I can listen to all day and never gets harsh.
 
If you are after detail and soundstage I think the LCD-X will be better suited. Being into detail you have plenty of options. There is not a lot of options for us lush guys.
 
On the flip side I have listened to the HD800's many many times. They are everywhere. Every time I listen I can't get them off fast enough. Really can only tolerate them for 30 seconds or so.
 
Nobody is correct. Just different.

Of course the HD800s soundstage is much bigger.  But on the 650 $%# NO.  The 650 sounds like a total mess.  The 600s are better IMO, however both don't compare the the LCD-3F.  
 
If you say your getting globs of micro details out the 650 the your impressions are questionable to me.  
 
I'm not sure what your setup is.  But the LCD-3F is a high end TOTL headphone, it shout be treated as such.  Because of it's warm presentation a traditional tube amp may not be the best to go with it.  A lean tube amp like the EC 445 is a great match for these headphones.  
 
I owned the LCD-3C and these are a level above in the clarity department, more air and a more spacious soundstage - compared to the older 3C.  
 
These headphones may not be for you.  But to say the 650s retrieve more detail is just not the case.

For Ed10 I am using AK240 as source playing hi-res files. I use Pro-ject RS DAC, preamp and head amp. All tubes.
Also have good results just using the AK240 connected to CI Audio head amp by AK Crystal cable and cutting the mid treble one notch on the AK eq.
Interestingly I have had the E10 for four years and the SQ is still changing, smoothing out and becoming softer at the top. I have read that the more recent E5 is still settling in after 18 months.
As for the Audeze by "roles reversed" I meant that it needs a bright DAC/amp combination to give it some treble life otherwise to my ears it sounds slightly muffled and dead: very accurate, forgiving of lesser quality files, which the E10 certainly is not, but too plush and lacking in punch. I usually listen to classical music.
All very subjective, but that is my humble opinion.

Hi,
I hope I wont interrupt the flow of the thread, but I would like to raise a kind of technical question regarding my LCDs.
 
I have an audio track (Preludium from 2014 reissue of album Theli by Therion) where there come audio distortions from the left headphone since around 2/3 of the track till the end.
I can think of two options: either there is something wrong with the track, or there is something wrong with the left headphone itself. To decide which hypothesis is true I decided to simply swap audio channels and viola! When the right headphone plays left channel, no audio distortions come out of it. So my conclusion is that I encountered a defect in the left headphone itself.
 
I thus decided to RMA LCD-3 with my local re-seller and loaned from him LCD-2 in return for not insisting that RMA process must be completed in 30 days (we are from Europe). But there comes another twist to the story: borrowed LCD-2 exhibits the same behavior. Left headphone cannot handle the track without distortions, but when I swap channels, right headphone again handles left channel without problems. And now, to top things off, the re-seller called me that after some testing on his audio setup, both the left and the right headphone produces audio distortions. So his conclusion is that there is something wrong with the audio track itself.
 
So at this point, if possible, I'd like to ask the community for a feedback.
Could either me or the re-seller be just "hearing" things?
Could the testing difference be attributed to that the re-seller's setup is single-ended, while mine is balanced?
 
And finally, would somebody be willing or interested to test the track on his or hers LCDs (or any other headphones for that matter)?
If so, below are links to the track in two lossless formats (both files are 10 MB; audio distortions are from 1:05 onward).
FLAC: http://www.filedropper.com/01-preludium
ALAC (in m4a container): http://www.filedropper.com/01-preludium_1
 
Thanks in advance,
 
     Martin
 
P.S. At this point, I have no doubt that the left headphone would produce the audio distortion, but I am currently at a loss as to what to make of the fact that upon channel swap (either SW or by physical exchange of CNC connectors), right headphone plays the left channel just fine on my setup (and I even tried disconnecting the left headphone entirely so that I eventually don't project the distortion just to it as was a suspicion of the re-seller).

So I've been comparing my recently acquired LCD-3fs (build date 5-15-15) to my well broken in Hifiman HE-560s for the past several hours using Tidal HiFi streaming via my Centrance HiFi M8 portable amp.
I gotta tell ya, I am not sure which phone I like best. The LCD 3 is more efficient for sure but the Centrance has no trouble driving either phone. Level matching was a challenge.
As for the bass,I expected it to blow the Hifiman out of the water but it turns out that the Hifiman not only digs just as deep(if not deeper) but also has more air around the bass notes. The bass on the LCD is more rounded off and fuller with more mid bass presence. Big surprise there.
Next is the midrange. It's more intimate on the LCD 3s and a bit more forward. They both sound great in this area, but I do understand why people love ithat LCD midrange. It is
creamy for lack of another word.
Next is the treble. Hifiman all the way. More extended and open without being edgy or harsh. The LCDs treble sounds fine until you switch to the Hifiman.
So it goes without saying that the Hifiman comes across as being more neutral and accurate. The Audeze don't try to hide the fact that they have more of a house sound. That house
sound is nice and everything sounds larger but I don't think at this point in time that it's preferable to the more open ,neutral sound of the Hifiman. Both get your toes tapping and that of course matters most to me.
Finally the weight difference is huge. But much to my surprise, the extra weight of the LCDs doesn't bother me one bit. They fit snug and secure and I think this helps offset its weight.
There you have it, my 3 hour assessment comparing these two phones. I will update after more extended listening if anything changes.Edited by Hifi59 - 6/11/15 at 4:54pm

Im Currently using the Brown leather ones (my LCD3's are about 9 months old) and have just got a pair of the Micro suede ones (same as yours i think) just to see if there is any difference between the 2 in regards to sound and comfort. I believe Audeze has encounter a lot of feedback regarding the fazored models and the Leather pads as with my right earcup the fazor touched my ear.

They are shipping out some small foam spacer pads which slide inside the pads with out the need to remove the pads at all (will post some pictures) resolved the issue for me but also made the leather a bit more stiffer than the softness they normally have.
 
I figure once i take them off i can try both and see which ones i prefer the most and also check out the quality inside the cups. Will take lots of photos and post later for you guys =)

Which pads did you go for?
 
I just had some new microfiber ones arrive and they look a lot slimmer than my leather ones Havent measured but will do, Its been a long road for me as i had an issue with one fazor touching my ear and not sitting straight. Tried to tell them it was a frame issue but they wanted to try pads first so (1 week waiting for foam spacers) still have the issue, then they sent me some new pads (another week waiting) still didn't fix the issue as the pads look a lot thinner. After a lot more emails they are finally sending me a new frame as its bent (the C shaped part that goes around the wooden cup). 
 
There is a guide on Audezes website for changing the pads. https://www.audeze.com/padschange Its really straight forward although some people have issues with the leather ripping off but another member suggested a smooth butter knife and slowly peel them off helps to reduce this.
 
Will post a photo comparison of the 2 pads for you guys tonight.

I posted the following in the "How many times have your LCD3 been returned to Audeze for servicing (RMA)" thread,   though I think it is appropriate to post as well in the LCD3 threads as a tale of caution.
 
.................................................................................................................................................................
 
Sweetmeat ... I like your idea of a poll ... I assume it was to obtain a better perspective on how bad the LCD3 failure rate is ... or if it being put out of proportion.
 
For trying to gain some perspective, I commend you.
 
Though I do find one issue with your poll that if you could kindly update if possible ... the highest choice is 3 times or more ... well, I am on driver failure number 5 
in the last 2.5 years of being a LCD-3 owner.   The first 4 failures were with the LCD-3C, it was replaced with a LCD-3F which just failed, making a total of 5 failures.
 
My first LCD-3C experienced 4 driver failures (a mix of left and right) .... so the average ... Audeze Mean Time Between Failure (AMTBF) for drivers is 6.5 months.
Also had a SE cable failure ... which was replaced with a cable which was dead on arrival. So 2 faulty cables.
A total of 6 issues or incidents in 2 years for the LCD-3C.  
The wood box is also poor quality ... when I opened my LCD-3 for the very first time , the hinge on the wood box broke.
I should have taken that as an omen of things to come,  though I am not counting that as an incident, do not want to appear picky.
 
I also find the Quality Control of Audeze very poor when performing repairs.
Remember sending it in for a Right Driver failure .... and it came back with a loose Left XLR connector, about 5mm movement away from the Left earcup.
So Audeze fix the Right side of my HP ... and it comes back with damage to the Left side ???
 
 
In December 2014 this was replaced with a new LCD-3F (came from my dealer) which just tonight experienced a failed Left Driver ... only 6.5 months old
... so the 6.5 months Audeze Mean Time Between Failure is consistent.
So, tonight, at the 2.5 year mark ... I am on issue number 7, driver failure number 5 for being an LCD-3 owner
 
 
The first 4 driver failures were with the LCD-3C ... the latest driver failure is with the LCD-3F ... making a total of of 5 Driver failures while having a LCD-3.
 
 
I had hoped that the driver failure issues was mainly for the LCD-3C ... though apparently it is still evident with the LCD-3F.
Had hoped it was a manufacturing issue which was resolved in the first year (or two) ... though newer LCD-3F still experience a high failure rate, which is disgraceful.
 
 
I have never had any HP, Speaker, fail .... ever.
DAC's or AMPs ... never.
Some electronics are more than 10 years old and they never fail like Audeze ... actually tonight I had to switch back to AKG-701's that I purchased early 2005 (?).
 
I treat my gear with respect, listen at low to moderate volumes.
Do not use the LCD-3 for travel.
Used with appropriate sized powered amps ... 1 or 2 Watt.
This is a reference piece of equipment, so it is in my own best interest to treat it with respect, which I do ... still it continually breaks down.
 
It is not just the disappointment of a product that is so unreliable when it breaks down , it also the continued escalating costs of shipping & insurance for a product which as far as reliability goes is .... shameful.
 
My average uptime ... that is when I have the LCD-3 at home (when it is not travelling around the world continually being repaired) is just .... 80%.
 
I think I have a fairly high tolerance and even up to incident number 6 I was still considering getting an Audeze LCD-X as I find the Audeze sound quality simply outstanding.
Also really find Audeze extremely comfortable.
 
Though, this last incident (number 7), which is driver failure number 5 has me rethinking that thought of buying anymore Audeze (like the LCD-X) very strongly ... I have had enough.
 
While I do strongly love both the comfort & sound quality of the LCD-3 ...as far as Audeze reliability is concerned, the best word for it is ..... shameful.   
 
I am disgusted.

Badas, Mikoss, Sweemeat, mine ... all our opinions are equally valuable.  
HeadFi is only a great community because of each of the individuals who spend there time contributing.
Some post more, some less.
 
Moving on ...
 
Interesting to hear that the NZ distributor dropped the Audeze line.   I wonder why that was ?
 
I know that I am making a number of posts because, well, driver failure number 5, kind of broke the camels back ... I do not wish any ill will towards Audeze ... actually the complete opposite, that is, I wish them every success, I want them to grow, strength by strength.    As I keep repeating my love of the Audeze sound quality (just trying to keep a balanced viewpoint in spite of the latest Audeze LCD3 driver failure),  I just wish they could provide a LCD3 driver that is reliable,  not disgraceful.
 
I was going to pickup the LCD-X later this year,  though with the latest failure, I am re-assessing and now looking at other manufacturers.
